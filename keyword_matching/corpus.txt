In lattice field theory, the Wilson action is a discrete formulation of the Yang–Mills action, forming the foundation of lattice gauge theory. Rather than using Lie algebra valued gauge fields as the fundamental parameters of the theory, group valued link fields are used instead, which correspond to the smallest Wilson lines on the lattice. In modern simulations of pure gauge theory, the action is usually modified by introducing higher order operators through Symanzik improvement, significantly reducing discretization errors. The action was introduced by Kenneth Wilson in his seminal 1974 paper, launching the study of lattice field theory.  Links and plaquettes Lattice gauge theory is formulated in terms of elements of the compact gauge group rather than in terms of the Lie algebra valued gauge fields                                    A                        μ                             (         x         )         =                    A                        μ                                   a                             (         x         )                    T                        a                                     {\displaystyle A_{\mu }(x)=A_{\mu }^{a}(x)T^{a}}    , where                                    T                        a                                     {\displaystyle T^{a}}     are the group generators.

Since the plaquettes relate the link variables to the discretized field strength tensor, this allows one to construct a lattice version of the Yang–Mills action using them. This is the Wilson action, given in terms of a sum over all plaquettes of one orientation on the lattice  It reduces down to the discretized Yang–Mills action with lattice artifacts coming in at order                                                 O                             (                    a                        2                             )                 {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}(a^{2})}    .  This action is far from unique. A lattice gauge action can be constructed from any discretized Wilson loop. As long as the loops are suitably averaged over orientations and translations in spacetime to give rise to the correct symmetries, the action will reduce back down to the continuum result. The advantage of using plaquettes is its simplicity and that the action lends itself well to improvement programs used to reduce lattice artifacts.

Delaware Township is a township in Hunterdon County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Part of the township is on the Hunterdon Plateau, while the southern portions are in the Amwell Valley. As of the 2020 United States census, the township's population was 4,560, a decrease of three people (−0.1%) from the 2010 census count of 4,563, which in turn reflected an increase of 85 (+1.9%) from the 4,478 counted in the 2000 census. The historic community of Sergeantsville is located within Delaware Township, as well as the unincorporated community of Raven Rock.  History The township was first settled in the early 18th century by Colonel John Reading (1657–1717), who was instrumental in the creation of Amwell Township in 1708 and also worked for the creation of Hunterdon County in 1714. The Township adjoins the Delaware River on the southwestern portion of Hunterdon County, which provides its name. The state's lone surviving historic covered bridge, Green Sergeant's Covered Bridge, crosses the Wickecheoke Creek between Sergeantsville and Rosemont. The Delaware and Raritan Canal parallels the Delaware River along the southern border of the township. Sergeantsville is at the township's center and includes the municipal building, local public school and Post Office. A "Thanksgiving in the Country" offers a tour of notable homes in Sergeantsville, which raises funds for the Facial Reconstruction Unit of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Delaware was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 2, 1838, from a portion of a larger municipality then known as Amwell Township (now defunct). Historian and cartographer John P. Snyder has erroneously stated that a referendum was held on that date, but there was in fact no referendum and the people of Amwell knew nothing about the division until after the Legislature passed the bill. A portion of the township was taken to form Stockton borough (April 14, 1898).  Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 37.05 square miles (95.95 km2), including 36.66 square miles (94.94 km2) of land and 0.39 square miles (1.01 km2) of water (1.06%). Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Bowne, Brookville, Dilts Corner, Grover, Headquarters, Locktown, Prallsville, Raven Rock, Rosemont, Sand Brook, Sandy Ridge and Sergeantsville. The township borders the municipalities of East Amwell Township, Franklin Township, Kingwood Township, Lambertville, Raritan Township, Stockton and West Amwell Township in Hunterdon County; as well as Plumstead Township and Solebury Township in Bucks County across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania.  Demographics 2010 census The 2010 United States census counted 4,563 people, 1,788 households, and 1,348 families in the township. The population density was 124.5 inhabitants per square mile (48.1/km2). There were 1,927 housing units at an average density of 52.6 per square mile (20.3/km2).

Of the 1,788 households, 26.6% had children under the age of 18; 66.2% were married couples living together; 6.3% had a female householder with no husband present and 24.6% were non-families. Of all households, 19.0% were made up of individuals and 7.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.55 and the average family size was 2.93. 20.1% of the population were under the age of 18, 6.1% from 18 to 24, 16.5% from 25 to 44, 41.2% from 45 to 64, and 16.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 48.6 years. For every 100 females, the population had 96.9 males. For every 100 females ages 18 and older there were 97.2 males. The Census Bureau's 2006–2010 American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household income was $87,100 (with a margin of error of +/− $15,616) and the median family income was $102,481 (+/− $27,024). Males had a median income of $82,586 (+/− $14,105) versus $47,404 (+/− $12,866) for females. The per capita income for the borough was $48,700 (+/− $4,857). About 0.6% of families and 0.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including none of those under age 18 and 0.9% of those age 65 or over.  2000 census As of the 2000 United States census there were 4,478 people, 1,643 households, and 1,302 families residing in the township. The population density was 121.9 inhabitants per square mile (47.1/km2). There were 1,701 housing units at an average density of 46.3 per square mile (17.9/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 97.70% White, 0.40% African American, 0.04% Native American, 1.03% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.25% from other races, and 0.56% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.14% of the population. There were 1,643 households, out of which 33.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.3% were married couples living together, 4.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.7% were non-families. 14.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.72 and the average family size was 3.06. In the township the population was spread out, with 23.4% under the age of 18, 5.9% from 18 to 24, 26.5% from 25 to 44, 32.3% from 45 to 64, and 11.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.3 males. The median income for a household in the township was $80,756, and the median income for a family was $90,842. Males had a median income of $61,701 versus $48,780 for females. The per capita income for the township was $38,285. 3.4% of the population and 2.3% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total people living in poverty, 1.2% are under the age of 18 and 12.2% are 65 or older.  Government Local government Delaware Township is governed under the Township form of New Jersey municipal government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form, the second-most commonly used form of government in the state. The Township Committee is comprised of five members, who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At an annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor. As of 2023, members of the Delaware Township Committee are Mayor Charles Herman (R, term on committee and as mayor ends December 31, 2023), Deputy Mayor Chad Bower (R, term on committee ends 2024; term as deputy mayor ends 2023), Susan D.

Our Whole Lives, or OWL, is a series of six comprehensive sexuality curricula for children, teenagers, young adults and adults published by the Unitarian Universalist Association and the United Church of Christ Justice and Witness Ministries. Publication was the result of seven years of collaborative effort by the two faiths to prepare material which addresses sexuality throughout the lifespan in age appropriate ways. The Our Whole Lives program operates under the idea that well informed youth and young adults make better, healthier decisions about sexuality than those without complete information. OWL strives to be unbiased and teaches about heterosexual, bisexual, homosexual, and transgender sexual health. In addition to information on sex, OWL is intended to help children, youth, and adults to be emotionally healthy and responsible in terms of their sexuality.  History In Unitarian Universalist congregations the grades 7–9 OWL curriculum replaced the somewhat controversial About Your Sexuality (AYS), which was created in the 1970s and went out of print in the 1990s. The OWL curriculum was first implemented in 1999.  Program structure There are four OWL curricula designed for the American school grades of K–1, 4–6, 7–9, 10–12, plus one for young adults (18- to 35-year-olds), one for adults, and one for older adults. Each curriculum approaches topics differently based on the age of participants. The K-1 curriculum, for example, looks at bodily autonomy, family, trusted adults, and that a sperm, egg, and uterus are required to make a baby. The curriculum for older adults, on the other hand, might discuss aging, disability, dating as an older person, and body image. Sessions are usually held weekly. Each session of the Our Whole Lives curriculum can include the "Sexuality and Our Faith" companion, which comes in separate versions, one for the UUA and CUC communities and another one for the UCC community. Without "Sexuality and Our Faith," the programs have no religious material and are thus appropriate for use in schools and other non-religious institutions. Facilitators for Our Whole Lives work in teams of at least two – one male and one female – for each class.  The gender balance allows participants to feel comfortable raising concerns, questions and issues with their facilitators.  For the middle school (grades 7-9) curriculum, some activities are done in gender segregated groups, otherwise all activities take place in mixed gender groups.  Program values Our Whole Lives is built upon three core values:  Respect Relationships Responsibility Participants are encouraged to use these values in decision-making concerning their own sexuality and relationships. Throughout the program, participants are encouraged to explore and learn to articulate their own values, such as self-worth, justice, and inclusivity. The program values confidentiality, with a "Question Box" often being used to allow participants to ask questions anonymously.  Program leaders Our Whole Lives classes are led by teams of facilitators recruited from within their congregations.  Before leading Our Whole Lives, facilitators must complete a training program led by certified trainers of trainers. In addition to exploring the core values and pedagogical theory underlying Our Whole Lives, trainings include opportunities to peer-facilitate a session. At the end of the training (which is approximately 20 hours of training over three days), facilitators must be certified by their trainers before leading Our Whole Lives in their congregations.   Leaders for Our Whole Lives are expected to model the program values - treating participants with respect and honoring their moral agency.

MP196 is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide. It falls under the structural class: short cationic peptides. Since it is a short cationic peptide, it can be easily synthesized, derivatized and isolated. MP196 is rich in tryptophan, a hydrophobic amino acid and arginine residues, a positively charged amino acid. It has structure: RWRWRW-NH2. This a short linear peptide with minimal pharmacophore. MP196 is effective against gram-positive bacteria and moderately effective against gram-negative bacteria. MP196 incorporates into the bacterial cytoplasmic cell membrane to bring about bacterial cell death. Differential scanning calorimetry results have shown that MP196 prefers incorporation into bacterial cell membranes over erythrocyte membranes, as this cationic peptide prefers incorporating into membranes which have a higher negatively charged phospholipid ratio. Erythrocytes are made up of neutral phospholipid, thus explaining why MP196 does not get incorporated into its membrane, because MP196 prefers negatively charged cytoplasmic membranes, it has a low hemolytic activity, and thus has low toxicity against humans. Incorporation of MP196 into the cell membrane causes detachment of cytochrome C and MurG proteins from the membrane. Cytochrome C is a protein involved in the bacterial respiratory chain and MurG is an enzyme involved in the bacterial cell wall biosynthesis pathway. These detachments, in turn, lead to limited cellular energy through the drop in the level of ATP and it undermines the cell wall integrity. Additionally, MP196 leads to osmotic destabilization in bacterial cells. These factors lead to bacterial cell death. MP196 does not need to be stereospecific to bring about bacterial cell death. MP196 was equally effective when synthesized with all D amino acids or all L amino acids.  MP196 is shown to be effective against some strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin intermediate-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA). MP196 brings about bacterial cell death through a wide variety of mechanisms, thus making it difficult for the bacteria to develop resistance. MP196 can be used as the key structure in order to develop any potential antimicrobial peptides which could help in fighting back against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.   == References ==

Louai Sakka (born 1972) is a Syrian of Turkish background, who was convicted in Turkey of playing a role in several terrorist bombings. His first conviction was overturned on appeal, and he is currently being re-tried.  Early life Sakka is the son of a wealthy factory owner in Aleppo, Syria.  Alleged jihadist career According to The Washington Post, Sakka was suspected of playing a role in a plot to bomb hotels in Amman, Jordan, on 31 December 1999. They reported he was the planner of the truck bomb attacks that killed 57 in Istanbul in 2003; that he was a trusted associate of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and had led foreign fighters during the battle of Fallujah; and that he aided other fighters in their travels, with funding and false passports. He was captured in Antalya when a bomb exploded in his apartment on 4 August 2005. The Washington Post reported that Turkish security officials asserted he had acknowledged that he had been constructing the bomb, which he intended to use as a suicide bomb when he guided a yacht into a cruise ship that had American GIs. Sakka was represented by Osman Karakan. Karakan said that Sakka had willingly acknowledged his jihadist activities, and remained committed to jihadism—but was nevertheless refusing to sign a confession. Sakka is believed to have undergone plastic surgery in order to hide from security officials. The Washington Post reported that he drank alcohol, and hung out with unmarried women, in order to mask the fact that he was a fundamentalist. Today's Zaman reported Sakka had warned Turkish troops in Afghanistan that they could be faced with “disaster”.  “Turkish [military] vehicles carry CIA agents in Afghanistan. The public should understand this fact. I’d like to warn [Turkish] soldiers about the disaster they could be faced with if they continue their activities. The Turkish military has been implicated in activities for which resister [Islam] combatants will never forgive them. I am calling the Turkish public as a friend. Save your children from Afghanistan.” On February 7, 2012, investigators from the United Nations interviewed Sakka, interested in whether he had played a role in the assassination of Lebanon's Prime Minister Refik Hariri. On 21 March 2012, the judge in Sakka's case barred him from the courtroom, because he was wearing an orange jumpsuit, similar to those made infamous for being issued to Guantanamo captives.   == References ==

Leora Bettison Robinson (née, Bettison; June 8, 1840 – January 19, 1914) was an American author and educator of the long nineteenth century. Together with her husband, she established the Holyoke Academy of Louisville, Kentucky. She was the author of The House With Spectacles, Than, Patsy, and other works.  Early life and education Leora Bettison was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, June 8, 1840. Her parents, Dr. Joseph R. Bettison and Ann Eliza Cathcart, moved to Louisville, Kentucky, before she was a year old. The Bettisons were of distinguished Huguenot lineage, being descended from Pierre Robert, of South Carolina. Bettison's family belong to the Cathcarts of Glasgow, Scotland, who, before coming to America in the seventeenth century, had settled in County Antrim, Ireland. Dr. Bettison was a surgeon in the Confederate States Army. Leora was the sixth of eleven children.  In her classes, Robinson's writings attracted attention, and many of her early efforts were published in the local papers.   She was brought up and educated in private and public schools of Louisville, being a member of the first graduating class of the girls' high school of that city in June, 1858. In speaking of her graduating essay, entitled "A Farewell From the Other End of the Class", George D. Prentice, editor of the Louisville Journal (now, The Courier-Journal ), said: "Miss Bettison is a genius, and she will, if she makes the effort, render this manifest to the world". He also paid her a signal compliment in publishing her essay entire in the Journal.  Career Since the age of sixteen, her life was devoted to educational work, starting as a teacher in the Louisville high school. On June 29, 1864, she married Prof. Norman Robinson, a graduate of Rochester University. The couple had one child, Jeannette Cathcart. Prof. and Mrs. Robinson established in Louisville a flourishing school, named Holyoke Academy. During that time, she wrote her earliest books, Than (New York, 1877), a sequel to The House With Spectacles, and Patsy (New York, 1878).  Owing to an accumulation of business interests by Prof. Robinson in Florida, they moved to that State in 1880, and resided in the capital, Tallahassee while he held the office of State chemist  During the terms of office in which Dr. Robinson was the state chemist of Florida, Mrs. Robinson often assisted him in his laboratory work. In Tallahassee, Mrs. Robinson did the best literary work of her life. In addition to writing books, she also contributed many strong articles to some of the leading magazines. As Florida correspondent of Home and Farm, she was widely known, and through her long series of truthful articles, entitled "Living in Florida", she was the means of influencing great numbers of people to settle permanently in the state.  For the last few years before her death, she was recognized as one of Florida's great educators. She kept abreast of the times in all things educational and found peculiar pleasure in reading the classics, in doing special literary work, and using her influence for the betterment of city government. Two years before her death, a strong article she wrote, entitled "Public Schools Remodeled", was widely copied in the Florida press. She advocated for years the publishing of all tax assessments and the taxing of all church property throughout the United States. She was a firm believer in woman's suffrage, but during the last few years of her life, she repeatedly said that she hoped the day would never come when women would gain the vote. While living in Louisville, she was a member of the Broadway Baptist Church; while in Florida, she belonged to the First Baptist Church of Orlando.  Death and legacy After an illness of only a few hours duration, Leora Bettison Robinson died on January 19, 1914.  Lake Leora in Florida was named in her honor.

The Country Lovers is a 1911 American short silent comedy film written by Frank E. Woods, and directed by Mack Sennett. The film stars Blanche Sweet, Charles West, Grace Henderson and Mack Sennett. It is a Biograph Company production, and distributed by The General Film Company. It was released in the United States on May 11, 1911 to mixed reviews.  Plot These two farm boys imagined that the best way to make an impression upon their sweethearts was to pose as heroes, and so they schemed. The plan they adopt is getting an old suit of clothing stuffed out with straw, and placing it under a bush with the booted feet protruding, to appear as if a man were sleeping there. It looks sinister enough and frightens the girls when they pass the spot.  The girls rush off and tell the boys, who armed with a rifle go to meet the intruder, but meanwhile Happy Jack, the tramp, has happened along, and appropriating the clothes, takes the place of the dummy, showing distinct signs of life at the approach of the would-be heroes. The movement of the supposed inanimate figure throws the boys into a panic of fright, and dropping their gun they make tracks for the house to the disgust of the girls.  Cast Blanche Sweet Charles West Grace Henderson Mack Sennett  Reviews The Moving Picture World was negative in their review, saying: "a very good chance was wasted in this film. It is theatrical and almost wholly unconvincing as it is. The personality of the six who act it is pleasing; but they have little chance to give human characterization to their parts. There is an amateurish tramp is the story. Still, now and then, the actors manage to bring out a ripple of laughter as the reel is being projected." Motography was positive in their review of the film, saying: "Biograph tried a risky experiment with this film and got away with it. The climax comes not far beyond the middle of the film and the remaining several hundred feet are obliged to work up a new set of complications leading to another climax. All that saves it from bedragglement is the fact that the second climax is funnier than the first. Few producers would have dared to take the risk, avoiding anti-climax like dynamite. It is a curious method of padding a film, dangerous in most cases, but successful enough here. The plot develops several amusing situations which are good for a number of laughs."

Shi Kefa (4 February 1601 – 20 May 1645), courtesy names Xianzhi and Daolin, was a government official and calligrapher who lived in the late Ming dynasty. He was born in Xiangfu (祥符; present-day Kaifeng, Henan) and claimed ancestry from Daxing County, Shuntian Prefecture (順天府大興縣; in present-day Beijing). He was mentored by Zuo Guangdou (左光斗). He served as the Minister of War in Nanjing during the early part of his career. He is best remembered for his defence of Yangzhou from the Qing dynasty and was killed when Yangzhou fell to Qing forces in April 1645. After his death, the Southern Ming granted him the posthumous name "Zhongjing" (忠靖; means "loyal and peaceful"). Nearly a century later, the Qianlong Emperor of Qing granted Shi Kefa another posthumous name, "Zhongzheng" (忠正; means "loyal and upright".) His descendants collected his works and compiled them into a book titled Lord Shi Zhongzheng's Collections (史忠正公集).  Early life and career Shi Kefa took the imperial examination and obtained a jinshi (進士) degree in 1628. He was appointed as an official in Xi'an, before subsequently serving as a yuanwailang (員外郎) and langzhong (郎中) in the Ministry of Revenue. In 1635 he followed the general Lu Xiangsheng (盧象昇) to suppress peasant revolts throughout the land. Two years later, he was promoted to yushi (御史) on the recommendation of the minister Zhang Guowei (張國維), and was also appointed as xunfu (巡撫; a type of regional governor) of Anqing, Luzhou (present-day Hefei), Taiping (near present-day Wuhu City), Chizhou (池州), and various counties in Henan, Jiangxi and Huguang provinces. In 1641, he was put in charge of the Caoyun system. In the seventh month of 1643, he was appointed as the Minister of War in Nanjing.  Serving the Southern Ming In the third lunar month of 1644, rebel forces led by Li Zicheng captured the Ming capital Beijing and the Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide. The following month, Wu Sangui defected to the Qing dynasty and opened Shanhai Pass, allowing the Qing armies to seize control of Beijing from Li Zicheng's rebel forces and overrun most of northern China. When news of the Chongzhen Emperor's death reached Nanjing, there was much debate on who would be the new Ming emperor. Even though Shi Kefa was effectively the leader of the Ming loyalists in Nanjing, he was unable to make a decision on the issue. In the fifth lunar month, Fengyang's Viceroy, Ma Shiying (馬士英), and others supported the prince Zhu Yousong to take the throne, and Zhu became the Hongguang Emperor of the Southern Ming. For his effort, Ma Shiying won the appreciation of Hongguang and replaced Shi Kefa as the effective head of government. In the face of Li Zicheng's rebel forces and the Qing armies, Shi Kefa advocated the policy of allying with Qing to eliminate the rebels first, then driving the Qing forces back north. However, the officials in the Southern Ming imperial court were disunited as they were more interested in pursuing their personal interests. The Southern Ming gradually weakened under the pressure of internal political struggle and the resignation of several officials. After losing his influence in the imperial court, Shi Kefa requested to be dispatched north to supervise defenses on the northern border. Due to internal conflict among the Ming generals along the border, Shi Kefa was unable to establish a strong defense. In the fourth lunar month of 1645, Zuo Liangyu (左良玉) led an army from Wuhan to attack Ma Shiying and Ruan Dacheng (阮大鋮). Ma Shiying ordered Shi Kefa to set up defenses at the northern border to resist Zuo Liangyu from the east. Zuo Liangyu was eventually defeated by Huang Degong (黃得功) while his army surrendered. Xuyi also surrendered to Qing and Sizhou (present-day Tianchang) fell to Qing. Shi Kefa moved back to Yangzhou and continued resisting the Qing invaders there.  Defence of Yangzhou In the fifth lunar month of 1645, Qing forces led by the Manchu prince Dodo besieged Yangzhou. Shi Kefa sent a messenger to request reinforcements. His subordinate Liu Zeqing (劉澤清) escaped north to Huai'an, while only Liu Zhaoji (劉肇基) came to Shi Kefa's aid. The Qing regent Dorgon wrote to Shi Kefa, asking for his surrender, but Shi declined. Shi Kefa's response, titled Reply to Dorgon's letter (復多爾袞書), was noted for its neither servile nor overbearing tone, and was circulated among later generations. Subsequently, Shi Kefa entrusted his subordinate Shi Dewei (史德威), whom he had adopted as a godson, with his funeral arrangements, saying that he wished to be buried at Plum Blossom Ridge (梅花嶺) after his death. On the 24th day, Qing armies bombarded Yangzhou with cannon fire and the city fell that night. Shi Kefa attempted suicide by slitting his throat but failed. He then ordered Shi Dewei to kill him but Shi Dewei tearfully refused and did not dare to look up at his godfather. Shi Kefa then shouted "I'm Military Inspector Shi. Quickly kill me!" and was captured as a prisoner-of-war. Dodo tried to persuade Shi Kefa to surrender and serve him, saying, "Previously we sent you a letter politely asking for your surrender, but you refused. Now that you've fulfilled your loyalty and righteousness, you should take on a new important responsibility – help me conquer Jiangnan." Shi Kefa replied, "I fall together with the city. My decision will not change. Even if I'm torn to pieces, my feelings will be as sweet as maltose. But do not harm the thousands of lives in Yangzhou!" Shi Kefa was then executed. Dodo was infuriated by the heavy casualties sustained by his army in conquering Yangzhou so he ordered that the entire city be put to the sword (the event is known as the Yangzhou massacre). Twelve days after Shi Kefa's death, his remains could not be found. A year later in 1646, Shi Dewei buried Shi Kefa's headdress and garments at Plum Blossom Ridge outside the Tianning Gate of Yangzhou. The Qing writer Quan Zuwang (全祖望) later wrote the Tale of Plum Blossom Ridge (梅花嶺記) to describe the event. The Shi Kefa Memorial, a shrine devoted to the memory of Shi Kefa, is located in present-day Yangzhou.  Calligraphy Shi Kefa was said to have been an individual of great energy and integrity, qualities reflected in his calligraphy, frequently in cursive and semi-cursive style.

Gambia–Turkey relations are the foreign relations between Gambia and Turkey.  Diplomatic relations Gambia and Turkey had generally friendly relations. Despite widespread skepticism about its survival, Gambia retained its sovereignty despite persistent Senegalese pressure for union and numerous ethnic groups that plagued the security of other countries. Dawda Jawara’s deliberate policy of converting the PPP from a Mandinka-dominated organization into a nationwide party enabled inter-ethnic cooperation and boosted Gambia's well-earned reputation for a beacon of democracy. Turkey has been very supportive of Gambia under Dawda Jawara and facilitated its economic situation with developmental and financial aid along with an Economic Recovery Program designed by the World Bank and IMF in 1985. Relations detonated on July 22, 1994 when a group of disaffected junior army officers seized power in a bloodless coup that allowed safe passage to President Dawda Jawara out of the country. Despite President Dawda Jawara's Gambia's well-earned reputation as one of the few democratic regimes in Africa, Western allies were late in coming to the rescue of Jawara’s government. Turkey, along with Western allies, promptly cut off aid to the military junta led by Yahya Jammeh and imposed further sanctions.  Relations improved in 1996–1997 with a formal return to elections and Turkey lifted economic sanctions that had thrown Gambia's economy into chaos.  Economic relations Trade volume between the two countries was negligible in 2018. There are direct flights from Istanbul to Banjul since November 26, 2018.  Educational relations Turkish Maarif Foundation operates in Banjul since October 2017.

Alex Tan (born March 13, 1996), better known under the screen names PangaeaPanga, PePanga and formerly penangbenny, is an American ROM hacker, speedrunner and tool-assisted speedrunner. He is best known as the creator of difficult Super Mario World ROM hacks and Super Mario Maker levels. His notable work includes Super Mario World ROM hack Super Dram World and Super Mario Maker levels "P-Break" and the "Pit of Panga" series. He has also played through Super Mario World blindfolded.  Personal life Tan is from Rocky Hill, Connecticut, and is a graduate of Rocky Hill High School. His fastest mile run is 4:23.13. In 2018, he graduated from the University of Connecticut School of Business with a degree in management information systems, and was an NCAA Division I cross country runner for the UConn Huskies during the 2014–2015 season. He also plays the piano and trumpet.  Speedrunning career PangaeaPanga was the world record holder for speedrunning Super Mario World in 2015, having beaten the game in 1 minute and 38 seconds using arbitrary code execution, though this record has since been beaten. PangaeaPanga started playing Super Mario World while blindfolded on June 16, 2015, and completed a full run of the game this way eight days later. He has stated that he got the idea from fellow player of Super Mario World DavisKongCountry, who played portions of the game blindfolded. To beat the game in this way, PangaeaPanga memorized a route that was "easy and consistent", using musical cues from the game to know when to carry out certain actions. The run took 23 minutes, despite playing as the character Mario, dying a few times, and getting lost. After having his world record beaten on July 20, 2016, in a time of 17:46, he reclaimed the title a few days later on August 8, 2016, with a time of 15:59 using the Japanese release, before once again having his world record beaten on May 24, 2017, with a time of 13:31. In September 2015, YouTube removed the majority of PangaeaPanga's tool-assisted speedrun videos from his channel after a Digital Millennium Copyright Act claim was made by Nintendo. PangaeaPanga described his YouTube channel as "wrecked" on Twitter and stated that he finds it a "shame" that content creators "are restricted to … Super Mario Maker instead of the way we have always done."  Super Mario levels ROM hacks Through ROM hacking, PangaeaPanga has made several difficult levels for Super Mario World, the most famous of which is "Item Abuse 3". This level, which took three years to create and beat, has been described as "the hardest Super Mario World level ever". The level is impossible to beat without making use of tool-assistance to allow individual frame button input. PangaeaPanga has declared that "Anyone who can complete this is pretty much mentally insane." In addition to the Item Abuse series, PangeaPanga has also created three additional hacks inspired by the Kaizo Mario World series titled Super Dram World, Super Dram World 2, and Super Foss World, of which the former two have been speedrun live at a Games Done Quick event.  Super Mario Maker In September 2015, 10 days after the American release of Super Mario Maker, PangaeaPanga uploaded "Pit of Panga: P-Break". The level, which took five hours to create, had to be beaten beforehand to be uploaded to Super Mario Maker's servers, as the game prevents players from uploading levels prior to clearing them in order to minimize the number of impossible levels in the game. PangaeaPanga beat the level in nine hours, all of which he streamed on Twitch. "P-Break" was a sequel to "Bomb Voyage", another difficult level PangaeaPanga created. It took the Super Mario Maker community a collective total of 11,000 tries before speedrunner Bananasaurus Rex beat this level. By the end of October 2015, "P-Break" was beaten 41 times. After stating that "in an ideal world, no more than ten clears would satisfy me", PangaeaPanga went on to create the even more difficult "Pit of Panga: U-Break", which was later awarded the world record for the "Most difficult level created in Super Mario Maker" by Guinness World Records. PangaeaPanga influenced several other people to create unusually difficult Super Mario Maker levels. In an interview, PangaeaPanga has stated that he never really tried to build easy levels, as he enjoys to "force players to take a single specific route", in contrast to the autonomy video games usually offer players. Furthermore, PangaeaPanga has noted that he aims to make levels "both fair and fun, without being too aggravating or difficult",  which he achieves by playtesting his levels extensively. One of his Super Mario Maker 2 levels, "Cyber Security 101: Brute Force", required players to enter two random eight-digit numbers, giving a player a 1 in 10 quadrillion chance of winning on a random attempt. Another level of his creation, "#SkipThis - Are We There Yet?", is the longest level in Super Mario Maker 2 when considering the real elapsed time from start to completion. This level takes 19 hours and 36 minutes to complete by combining several in-game mechanics together to pass as much real time as possible while incrementing the in-game counter as little as possible.  On June 1, 2021, Canadian speedrunner Warspyking became the first player to consecutively beat all 47 levels created by PangaeaPanga in Super Mario Maker 1, setting the world record at 8 hours, 55 minutes, and 7 seconds. He is also known for doing Endless Expert runs.  References Further reading External links PangaeaPanga's Twitch.tv channel YouTube channel Profile on Speedrun.com

Hudjefa (Ancient Egyptian for "erased" or "missing") is the pseudonym for a 2nd Dynasty pharaoh as reported on the Turin canon, a list of kings written during the reign of Ramses II. Hudjefa is now understood to mean that the name of the king was already missing from the document from which the Turin canon was copied. The  length of the reign associated to Hudjefa on the canon is 11 years. Because of the position of Hudjefa on the Turin list, he is sometimes identified with a king Sesochris reported in the Aegyptiaca, a history of Egypt written by the Egyptian priest Manetho in the 3rd century BC. Manetho credits this pharaoh with 48 years of reign. Egyptologists have attempted to relate Hudjefa with archaeologically attested kings of the period, in particular Seth-Peribsen.  Name sources The name "Hudjefa" appears only in the Royal Table of Sakkara and in the Royal Canon of Turin. Both king lists describe Hudjefa I as the immediate successor of king Neferkasokar and as the predecessor of king Khasekhemwy (here named Bebty).  Identity Egyptologists and historians have had great difficulty linking Hudjefa I to any archaeologically identified ruler. The problem is that "Hudjefa" is not a personal name in the conventional sense. Hudjefa means "erased" and might reveal that the original king's name, originally listed in a document or inscribed on some object, was unreadable when the scribe tried to compile the king list. It is thought that a scribe simply noted "erased", but then erroneously put the word into a cartouche, thus making it look like a personal name. Later scribes and students of Egyptian history misinterpreted the arrangement and adopted it into their documents as a king's name. The ancient Greek historian Manetho probably called Hudjefa I "Sésôchris" and reported that this king's body had a measurement of "five cubits in its height and three hands in its breadth". Egyptologists doubt the basis of this observation as no burial site for Hudjefa I has ever been found. Egyptologists such as N. Dautzenberg and Wolfgang Helck once considered that Hudjefa I might be identical with king Seth-Peribsen. To support their theory, they pointed out that an 11-year reign – as noted in the Royal Canon of Turin – would be inconsistent with a king whose name has been lost. Rather, in their opinion, it would make sense if the ruler's name was not allowed to be mentioned in later times. This was already considered to be the case of king Peribsen, whose birth name was banished from Ramesside king lists.  Reign Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck, Nicolas Grimal, Hermann Alexander Schlögl and Francesco Tiradritti believe that king Nynetjer, the third ruler of 2nd dynasty and a predecessor of Peribsen, left a realm that was suffering from an overly complex state administration and that Nynetjer decided to split Egypt to leave it to his two sons (or, at least, two chosen successors) who would rule two separate kingdoms, in the hope that the two rulers could better administer the states. In contrast, Egyptologists such as Barbara Bell believe that an economic catastrophe such as a famine or a long lasting drought affected Egypt. Therefore, to better address the problem of feeding the Egyptian population, Ninetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms, until the famine came to an end. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, in her opinion, the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period. Bell's theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who corrected Bell's calculations. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Nynetjer's time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell had overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription only takes into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis, but not elsewhere along the river. Any long-lasting drought can therefore be excluded. It is accepted amongst a number of Egyptologists that Hudjefa I had to share his throne with another ruler although it is unclear as to who that ruler was. Later king lists such as the Sakkara list and the Turin Canon list the kings Neferkara I and  Neferkasokar as his predecessors and king Khasekhemwy as immediate successors. The Abydos list skips the rulers Neferkara I, Neferkasokar and Hudjefa I completely and name a king Djadjay (identical with king Khasekhemwy). If Egypt was already divided when Hudjefa I gained the throne, kings like Sekhemib and Peribsen would have ruled Upper Egypt, whilst Hudjefa I and his predecessors would have ruled Lower Egypt. The division of Egypt was brought to an end by king Khasekhemwy.   == References ==

The Fox Islands Passes are waterways in the Fox Islands area of the U.S. state of Alaska, connecting the Bering Sea with the North Pacific Ocean. From the southward and eastward, bound for Bering Sea, there are three passes used by deep-draft vessels, known collectively as the Fox Islands Passes, and respectively as Unimak, Akutan, and Unalga passes. The largest and most desirable one to use in thick and foggy weather is the eastern one, Unimak Pass. This is clear of hidden dangers, the widest of the three, and is comparatively free from tide rips. It is especially recommended for sailing vessels, and for steamers bound direct to the northward.  Akutan and Unalga passes are convenient for steam vessels bound to Unalaska Bay, but, being narrow and having strong currents and tide rips at times, are not recommended for sailing vessels bound north. A fair wind is almost necessary for the passage, and from the southward this would bring fog. The pass between Ashmiak and Ugamok islands on the east and Sea Lion Island on the west may be clear of dangers, but it is not recommended. All of the other minor passes between Unimak and Akutan passes are known to be full of rocks and reefs.  The mountains in this vicinity would be excellent landmarks if they could be seen, but in summer they are almost always obscured by fogs or low-lying clouds. The lower hills and islands and objects near the sea level furnish the available landmarks. In coming from the southward or eastward in clear weather, and if bound through Akutan or Unalga passes, it is recommended to steer for Tigalda Island as the first land to be made. It is high and prominent, and when once made a course can be shaped for any of the three passes.  Description Unimak Pass Unimak Pass (54°20′01″N 164°55′14″W) is the widest of the Fox Islands Passes, being 9 or 10 miles wide in its narrowest part. It is clear of hidden dangers, free from dangerous tide rips, and the tidal current has less velocity than in the other passes. Except near shore, it is free of sudden blasts of wind descending from the mountainous coast to the sea, known as williwaws. It is the most desirable pass for sailing vessels, and also for all vessels not calling at Unalaska Bay. In approaching from the southward and eastward, care must be taken to keep clear of Sannak Reefs and Anderson and Lenard rocks. If very clear, the mountains of Unimak Island may be made out and the course for Unimak Pass shaped accordingly; but under ordinary conditions the hills back of Cape Khituk, or Ugamok Island, will be the first land sighted. If the weather is thick, soundings on Davidson Bank will be of use in feeling the way in to the land. In the vicinity of Cape Khituk the coast is bold and free from outlying dangers.  A reef of rocks was formerly shown on the chart extending between 1 and 2 miles from the east end of Ugamok Island. The IMO Maritime Safety Committee per IMO SN.1/Circ.331 adopted five 'Areas to Be Avoided' (ATBA) in the region of the Aleutian Island Archipelago in order to reduce the risk of a marine casualty and resulting pollution and damage to the environment. These new ATBA’s came into effect on January 1, 2016. The five ATBA’s apply to vessels solely in transit through the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean and in most areas extends no further than 50 nautical miles from the shoreline of the islands. The 50 nautical mile buffer zone is designed to allow for the repair of, or time to launch an emergency response effort to any marine casualty before it runs aground and damages the fragile ecosystem. The establishment of the ATBA adds minimal distance to a voyage.  Akutan Pass Akutan Pass is about 3 miles wide in its narrowest part. There are four small islets (Gull Rocks) on the western side of the pass, less than 1 mile from Unalga Island, with many detached rocks above water in the same group, but not extending beyond the islets into the pass. There is a reef with some pinnacle rocks on it extending from Cape Morgan not more than 1 mile into the pass. With these exceptions there are no known dangers. The current and tide rips are not so strong as in Unalga Pass. On this account, and because of its greater width and the fact that a straight course will carry through, this pass is preferred by many to Unalga Pass. Akutan Pass is recommended for steamers bound to or from Unalaska Bay, and for sailing vessels from Unalaska Bay, having a fair wind. From the southward it is recommended to make the land in the vicinity of Tigalda Island and Avatanak Island and follow along the south side of these islands until the course is shaped from Rootok Island to Cape Morgan. From Cape Morgan a west by south course, making allowance for the current, will carry clear of the ledge off Cape Kalekhta. From Unalaska Bay, after clearing Cape Kalekhta, Akutan Pass is open and an east by north course can be steered through.  Unalga Pass Unalga Pass is the small pass between Unalga and Unalaska islands. It is the narrowest and shortest of the three passes, and is more generally used by steamers bound to and from Unalaska Bay than either of the other two. It is about one mile wide in its narrowest part, and, with the exception of rocks above water which make out a short distance from the points of Unalaska Island, the pass is considered free from dangers. In the middle of the pass there are depths of 25 to 35 fathoms, with deeper water northwestward and southeastward. Its worst features are the strong tidal currents and tide rips, both of which are generally considered worse in this pass than in either of the other two; williwaws of great force are also experienced -in this pass. The advantage of using this pass in thick weather is that the shore of Unalga Island is clear of dangers, and when made can be followed close enough to keep it in sight while going through. The Signals, Egg Island, and Old Man are the prominent landmarks for making Unalga Pass from the southeastward.  Soundings To the southward of the passes, the 100-fathom curve is found from 20 to 40 miles offshore, and when inside of this depth the color of the water will have changed from dark blue to light green. This change in the color of the water is the best indication the mariner has in thick weather to warn him of his approach to land and that he is on soundings. Southwest of Unimak Pass the 50-fathom curve is from 3 to 5 miles offshore, and in thick weather the greatest caution should be used in approaching inside of this depth. Southeast of Unimak Pass, the water shoals rapidly from 100 fathoms to Davidson Bank, on which a least depth of 37 fathoms is marked 33 miles from Ugamok Island.  Tides and currents In the vicinity of the passes and in the passes, the tidal currents are strong and their directions uncertain. The current sets southward during the falling tide and northward during the rising tide, which is the longer and stronger of the two. Its velocity varies, but in Unalga Pass, where it is greatest, it has been found to be 61 knots an hour during the whole of the tide, and the current turned to the opposite direction at the same velocity in twenty minutes. At ordinary times the tidal current does not amount to more than three or four knots. On the Bering Sea side of Unalga and Akutan passes, with a strong northerly or northwesterly wind, heavy tide rips are raised. These do not extend through the passes, but seem to be confined to the Bering Sea side from about the middle of Unalga Island almost to Cape Kalekhta. With the ebb tide, a southerly wind does not seem to raise corresponding rips on the Pacific side. When the tide rips are heavy, the water is broken into heavy, choppy seas from every direction. Uniinak Pass is comparatively free from tide rips. In ordinary weather it is high or low water in Akutan Pass between one and two hours before high or low water at Dutch Harbor.  Anchorages Beaver Inlet, between Biorka and Unalaska islands, is a deep inlet on the western side of the southern entrance to Unalga Pass. There are several bays leading out of Beaver Inlet. The best anchorage is said to be in Food Bay, on the north side of the inlet, near its entrance. The anchorage near the shore off the village of Biorka, on the south side of the inlet, is poor on account of the deep water; it affords shelter in southerly weather. English Bay, southwest of Unalga Island, is a good harbor. The water is deep, and there are no dangers except on both sides of the entrance, near the shore. The anchorage is at the head of the bay, in about 10 fathoms. Kalekhta Bay, eastward of Cape Kalekhta, is clear of dangers except along shore. Anchorage should not be made in less than 10 fathoms. The bay is much smaller in every way than Unalaska Bay, but it is marked by a cascade on its western side not unlike the one recommended as a landmark for Unalaska Bay. There is also a pinnacle rock off Erskine Point, the eastern point at the entrance, somewhat similar to Priest Rock; but this rock is distinguished by a smaller one between it and Erskine Point.  Prominent features Peaks Shishaldin Volcano, nearly 9,000 feet high, is cone-shaped and very regular in outline, with faint wreaths of smoke and vapor at times drifting from its blackened tip. It is for the most part snow-clad, except where the rocky cliffs and projections afford no lodgment. Isanotski Peaks is seen close to the eastward of Shishaldin, very rugged, and having a broken or castellated double peak. The summit is bare and looks as though composed of great vertical rock masses. Pogrumnoi Volcano, over 5,500 feet high, is a rugged, snow-clad peak, with dark vertical ridges cropping through the snow. From a flat-topped dome, apparently as high as Pogrumnoi, but seemingly not connected with it, there extends a long, high, snow-covered table-land, dipping gradually toward Cape Khituk. Except the snow-covered portions, the general color is green during July and August, from the grass-covered slopes. Pogrumnoi is a guiding landmark in clear weather in making Unimak Pass.  Islands Ugamok Island is rugged in outline, with bold rocky cliffs. It is highest at the eastern end, where there is a sharp conical peak, which is very conspicuous, and may often be seen when the summits of the higher islands in the vicinity are obscured by fog. The northern and eastern sides of the island are free from dangers. Tigalda Island is high and prominent, with distinctly rounded hills, resembling knuckles. The southern shore of the island can be approached as close as 1 mile. The northern and northwestern sides of the island are foul and should not be approached. Avatanak Island is highest at its eastern end, where it terminates in a bold cliff; toward the western end, which is low, is a pile of very prominent rocks, resembling a ruined castle. The hills are not rounded like those of Tigalda, but are rugged and torn. The southern shore is apparently safe. Rootok Island, lying westward of Avatanak Island and separated from the latter by a foid passage, is high, bold, and abrupt, and about 3 miles long in a general east-northeast and west-southwest direction. The shores of this island are free from outlying dangers. Akutan Island is 3,332 feet high. The volcano is a rugged cone, with generally a faint column of smoke issuing from its northeast side near the top. The north side of the island is a fairly regular slope, breaking off at the coast in steep cliffs. The south side is more irregular and the cliffs at the coast are higher and more rocky and broken. In summer the lower parts of the island are grass-covered. Cape Morgan, the southwest point, is high and very bold and precipitous. A shelf of dark rock is at the base of the cliffs, and a reef having three pinnacle rocks above water extends off the cape about 1 mile. Unalga Island is comparatively low, with a steep ragged shore line of cliffs surrounded by detached pinnacle rocks. The top of the island is covered with grass and shows up well against the dark hills beyond. There is a reef which extends about 200 yards off the northwest end of the island. Gull Rocks lie off the northeast side of Unalga Island. The group consists of four small islets, standing well out of the water and less than 1 mile from Unalga Island. There are many detached rocks in the same group, but not extending beyond the islets into Akutan Pass. Egg Island, situated a short distance northward from Biorka Island, is a landmark for Unalga Pass. It is moderately high, rather ragged on top, dark in color, and has a comparatively rounded outline. There is a good passage between the island and Cape Biorka, with a depth of 35 fathoms. When the island bears about southwest by south, a small island, detached from the main island, will open out on its southeastern end. A dark pinnacle rock, showing plainly, lies close to the north end of the island. The shores of the island are free from dangers. The Signals are two low, barren rocks, about 3 miles southward of Egg Island. The channel between them and Biorka Island is clear, with a depth of 10 fathoms. A sunken rock is just outside the Outer Signal. Old Man is a small, square-topped rock, about 60 feet high, lying about 1 mile northwest from Egg Island. There is a low, round-topped rock close to the Old Man. Old Man stands out well clear from Egg Island and, in thick weather, serves as an excellent mark by which to recognize Egg Island. Aleks Rock, on which the sea breaks in a well-defined breaker, is about 20 feet across, and lies with Sannak Peak bearing approximately northeast, distant 19 miles.

Clear aligners are orthodontic devices that are a transparent, plastic form of dental braces used to adjust teeth. Clear aligners have undergone changes, making assessment of effectiveness difficult. A 2014 systematic review concluded that published studies were of insufficient quality to determine effectiveness. Experience suggests they are effective for moderate crowding of the front teeth, but less effective than conventional braces for several other issues and are not recommended for children. In particular they are indicated for "mild to moderate crowding (1–6 mm) and mild to moderate spacing (1–6 mm)", in cases where there are no discrepancies of the jawbone. They are also indicated for patients who have experienced a relapse after fixed orthodontic treatment. Clear-aligner treatment involves an orthodontist or dentist, or with home-based systems, the person themselves, taking a mold of the patient's teeth, which is used to create a digital tooth scan. The computerized model suggests stages between the current and desired teeth positions, and aligners are created for each stage. Each aligner is worn for 22 hours a day for one or two weeks. These slowly move the teeth into the position agreed between the orthodontist or dentist and the patient. The average treatment time is 13.5 months. Despite patent infringement litigation, no manufacturer has obtained an injunction against another manufacturer.  Uses A 2014 systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of these clear aligners. Opinion is that they are likely useful for moderate front-teeth crowding. In those with teeth that are too far forward or backward, or rotated in the socket, the aligners are likely not as effective as conventional braces. More cases of relapse of the anterior teeth have been found with clear aligners compared with conventional braces. A 2013 Cochrane review found no high-quality evidence with respect to the management of the recurrence of lower-front-teeth misalignment following treatment. Clear aligners are more noticeable than lingual braces, but they can be removed, which makes cleaning of the teeth easier, and they are faster for the dentist to apply.  Application Treatment begins with taking x-ray and photographs for diagnostic purposes, followed by capturing the patient's bite, teeth, and gums via a bite registration and polyvinyl siloxane impressions or an intra-oral digital scanner. The latter method has greatly increased in popularity in recent years as digital scanning technology has improved. The dentist/orthodontist completes a written evaluation that includes diagnosis and treatment plan. Dental impressions are  scanned in order to create a digital 3D representation of the teeth. Technicians move the teeth to the desired location with the program Treat, which creates the stages between the current and desired teeth positions. Anywhere from six to eighty aligners may be needed during the first set of aligners. Each aligner moves teeth .25 to .33 millimeters. Additional and subsequent rounds of aligners, known as "Refinements", may be necessary to achieve desired tooth positions as clear aligners do not always achieve full movement in the first round. A computer graphic representation of the projected teeth movements, created in the software program ClinCheck, is provided to the doctor and patient  for approval or modification before aligners are manufactured. The aligners are modeled using CAD/CAM (computer-aided-design and computer-aided-manufacturing) software and manufactured using a rapid prototyping technique called stereolithography. The molds for the aligners are built in layers using a photo-sensitive liquid resin that cures into a hard plastic when exposed to a laser. The aligners are made from an elastic thermoplastic material that applies pressure to the teeth to move into the aligner's position. Patients that need a tooth rotated or pulled down may have a small, tooth-colored composite attachment bonded onto certain teeth. Since the form-fitted plastic used in clear aligners is not as rigid as the metal used in traditional braces, sometimes the flexibility in the materials need to be compensated in the areas that require movement. Alternatively, attachments may be used to facilitate movement by changing the shape of the tooth. More attachments can make the aligners less aesthetically pleasing. Interproximal reduction (IPR, also called reproximation or, colloquially, filing or drilling) is sometimes used at the contacts between teeth to allow for a better fit. Each aligner is intended to be worn an optimal 22 hours a day for one to two weeks. On average the treatment process takes 13.5 months, although treatment time varies based on the complexity of the planned teeth movements. The aligner is removed for brushing, flossing and eating. As clear aligners are made from plastic, they can be warped by hot liquids. While undergoing treatment one should limit their intake of hot liquids to protect the shape of the aligners and stop them from becoming stained. Once the treatment period has concluded, the patient is advised to continue wearing a retainer at night for the foreseeable future. When the Invisalign system was first developed, many of the aligner manufacturing processes were carried out by hand, and computer technicians had to modify each tooth in the computerized model individually.  Brands Invisalign Invisalign is manufactured by Align Technology, an American multinational medical-device company. The company's clear align system has been used to treat more than 12.2 million patients. The company was founded in 1997 by Zia Chishti. Chishti conceived of the basic design of InvisAlign while an adult orthodontics patient. During his treatment with a retainer intended to complete his treatment, he posited that a series of such devices could effect a large final placement in a series of small movements. Sales began in the U.S. in 1999. Orthodontists were resistant to adopting Invisalign at first, in particular because the founders had no orthodontic credentials or expertise, but the product became popular among consumers. As of 2014, 80,000 dentists had been trained how to use it.  Orthoclear Zia Chishti was ousted from Align Technology in 2002. In 2005 he developed Orthoclear, a similar product, which resulted in several legal disputes involving allegations of patent infringement, false advertising, defamation and trademark infringement. The case was settled in 2006. Align paid OrthoClear $20 million and OrthoClear agreed to end its operations.  ClearCorrect ClearCorrect, LLC, based in Round Rock, Texas, was established in 2006. The company distributes its product throughout the United States, and in 2011 was named the fastest-growing health company in America by Inc. magazine. It has been reported that in 2017 its clear align system had been used to treat about 80,000 patients. ClearCorrect was founded in Houston, Texas, by Willis Pumphrey, Jr., a dentist. In 2001, Pumphrey started using Invisalign. He decided to switch to OrthoClear, because of the way OrthoClear manufactured its aligners and because of its reduced lab fees. When manufacture of Orthoclear ceased, Pumphrey had 400 patients in treatment. With no other options available, he started his own company to complete his patients' clear aligner treatment.  Direct to Consumer Brands SmileDirectClub SmileDirectClub, based in Nashville, Tennessee, was launched in 2014 as an alternative to in-office clear aligners. The company offered direct-to-consumer clear aligner service which can be availed from home, without having to see a dentist. This allowed them to price aligners at half of the other competitors. The company faced criticism from the orthodontic community because of no involvement of a physical dentist. Similar startups have also launched in different parts of the world. In September 2023, SmileDirectClub filed for bankruptcy, before shutting down completely in December 2023, leaving thousands of customers without any support.  Smile White Smile White is a UK-based company that offers clear aligners. In June 2023, the brand was acquired by twin dentists Hussein and Hassan Dalghous, known on TikTok as TwinDentists.  Direct to consumer clear aligner services Following SmileDirectClub, multiple companies provide aligner treatment to patients by mailing their aligners and monitoring the treatment through a digital platform. The American Association of Orthodontists, the largest society representing orthodontists in the United States and abroad, released consumer alert explaining potential risks associated with such services.  Society and culture Lawsuits The litigious history in the clear aligner market prompted ClearCorrect to be proactive in addressing patent issues between itself and Align Technology. Align had previously filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission against OrthoClear Inc. In the end an agreement was made between Align and OrthoClear in which Align paid OrthoClear $20 million for its intellectual property and OrthoClear agreed to stop accepting cases in the United States. In 2009, Align Technology began to require that doctors prescribing Invisalign complete at least ten cases per year and ten hours of training in order to maintain their Invisalign provider status. In January 2010, 20,000 doctors had their certification suspended for not meeting the requirements, but a class action lawsuit regarding providers that paid for training under the original rules resulted in some certifications being re-instated. In February 2009, ClearCorrect filed a declaratory judgment against Align Technology. ClearCorrect claimed that some of Align's patents were invalid, and thus ClearCorrect's product did not infringe on Align's patents. ClearCorrect voluntarily dismissed the suit in April 2009, after Align stated to the court that it had no intention of suing ClearCorrect for patent infringement. On February 28, 2011, Align Technology filed two lawsuits against ClearCorrect. Align alleged that under California's Unfair Practices Act, that ClearCorrect sold products for a price below the average production cost, with the purpose of "destroying competition in the market for clear aligner systems". Align also claimed that ClearCorrect infringed eight of Align's patents. On May 12, 2011, ClearCorrect filed a countersuit against Align Technology, denying allegations that it is infringing on Align patents. In the countersuit, ClearCorrect alleged that Align's allegations are invalid and accused Align of patent misuse and double patenting. The countersuit cited much of the evidence raised in Align's previous patent case against Ormco, which resulted in a federal court ruling that 11 of Align's patent claims were invalid.  Costs The cost of clear aligners is typically lower than their all-metal counterparts because of the materials and technology used. Prices are rarely impacted by factors such as the duration of the treatment and the extent of the issues requiring correction, as much as specific details of the treatment plan, time/age of treatment, location, the experience of the orthodontist. In countries such as Australia, Canada, United States and United Kingdom prices are fairly similar across providers at circa $2,000/£1,500.  Notes References Further reading Phan, Xiem; Ling, Paul H.

Jiljilyya (Arabic: جلجليّا) is a Palestinian village in the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate in the northern West Bank.  Location Jiljilyya is  located (horizontally) 14.11 kilometers (8.77 mi) northeast of Ramallah. It is bordered by Al Mazra'a ash Sharqiya  to the east,  Sinjil to the east and north, 'Abwein to the north, west and south, and by Silwad  to the south.  History Several scholars have identified Jiljliya as one of several biblical places named Gilgal. Pottery sherds from the Iron Age II, Roman, Byzantine Byzantine/Umayyad, and the Crusader/Ayyubid eras have been found here.  Ottoman era The village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1596 it appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as Jinjiliyya, being in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Quds, part of the liwa (district) of Quds. It had a population of 8 households, all Muslims. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33.3% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, vineyards, fruit trees, goats and/or beehives, in addition to "occasional revenues"; a total of 2,600 akçe. Pottery sherds from the early Ottoman era have also been found here. In 1838 Edward Robinson noted Jiljilia on his travels in the region, and connected it with ancient Gilgal. He further noted it  as a Muslim village,   located in the Beni Zeid district, north of Jerusalem. In 1870 Victor Guérin found Djildjilia to have 200 inhabitants, while an Ottoman village list of about the same year counted 14 houses and a population of 49 in dschildschilija, though the population count included only men. In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Jiljilia as: "A large village on the top of a high hill, with a well to the south, and a few olives. The ridge is arable land." In 1896 the population of  Dschildschilja was estimated to be about 138 persons.  British Mandate era In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Jeljelieh had a population of 162 Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 212 Muslims, in 47 houses. In the 1945 statistics, the population was 280 Muslims, while the total land area was 7,283 dunams, according to an official land and population survey. Of  this, 1,897 were  plantations and irrigable land, 1,940 for cereals, while 16 dunams were classified as built-up (urban) areas.  Jordanian era In the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Jiljilyya came under Jordanian rule. It was annexed by Jordan in 1950. The Jordanian census of 1961 found 490 inhabitants in Jiljiliya.  Post-1967 Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Jiljilyya  has been under Israeli occupation. After the 1995 accords, 99.3% of  village land was classified as Area A, while the remaining 0.7% was classified as Area B.  Death of Omar Assad In January 2022, 78-year-old Omar Assad died after being detained by Israeli soldiers. Assad had lived in the US from 1967, was a US citizen, and had returned to his childhood village for his retirement in 2010. The Israeli spokesman stated that Assad  was alive when he was released, but this was contradicted by several eye-witnesses. The autopsy found that he had died  from “a stress-induced heart attack probably brought on by being bound and gagged and held in a cold construction site.”  In February, the US State Department said it wanted a “criminal investigation” into his death. In October, Israeli spokesperson claimed that a settlement had been reached with the Assad family, and that Israel would pay them  500,000 shekels, (~$141,000), in return for their  withdrawal of  the case against the Israeli state. However, the family denied this, saying that they had rejected the offer.

Holy Trinity Church is a small Anglican church located in Rathclaren, County Cork, Ireland. It was completed in roughly 1650. It is dedicated to the Holy Trinity. It is part of the Bandon Union of Parishes in the Diocese of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross.  History The church either the third and or possibly the fourth church to have served the parish of Rathclaren, with the earliest church dating to at least 1291. There a ruins of the foundation of a middle age church opposite the road from Holy Trinity Church. The parish, originally Roman Catholic, was reformed in the late 1500s. The current church was built sometime around 1650. Significant work was carried out on the building in 1835, with help from a grant given by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. A large tower was added in the 19th century. The current ceiling of the church was installed in the 1930s, while at the same time the wooden frames that surrounded the round-headed windows were replaced with concrete plate tracery.  Architecture The church has a mixed architectural style, primarily of neoclassicism and Venetian Gothic Revivalism, along with some elements of Hiberno-Romanesque revival architecture.  The main body of the church is built in the classical style, the windows are not original to the building and have neo-gothic elements, whilst the belfry is designed in the Hiberno-Romanesque style. The building's lychgate entrance is considered unusual, and is associated with the English style of church building. In 1876, Ludlow Sealy gifted the church a clock which is now installed in the tower. The tower was rebuilt that same year, adding the coloured brick dressings and angle buttresses to the tower, along with the clock. A ring of ten tubular bells are hung in the tower. Installed in 1896, they were installed in memory of members of the Sealy family. The church features a memorial to Colonel Sampson Stawell, who died in 1849. It comprises a marble plaque flanked by soldiers, and was made by Thomas Gaffin.  Notable clergy members Edward Synge served as rector of the parish in the late 1600s, and later became the Archbishop of Tuam in 1716. Upon being made the Bishop of Raphoe in 1714, Synge donated a silver communion chalice to Rathclaren church. Richard Clarke served as rector of the parish from 1984 to 1993, before being made the Dean of Cork. In 1996 he was promoted to Bishop of Meath and Kildare.  References Notes   === Sources ===

Rhys Dean Hoskins ( REESS; born March 17, 1993) is an American professional baseball first baseman for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Philadelphia Phillies. Hoskins played college baseball for the Sacramento State Hornets. He was drafted by the Phillies in the fifth round of the 2014 MLB draft, and made his MLB debut in 2017.  Early life Hoskins was born on March 17, 1993, in Sacramento, California. His parents, Paul and Cathy Hoskins, were both lawyers. Hoskins was a competitive child, eager to win at card and board games as well as pickup games in the family's backyard. When he was two years old, his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She ultimately died of the disease in 2009, shortly before Hoskins' 16th birthday. After his mother's death, Hoskins grew closer to his younger sister Meloria. A lifelong fan of the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB), Hoskins modeled his baseball performance first after J. T. Snow, who had a background in gridiron football as well as playing first base, and later on Paul Goldschmidt. Hoskins became a multi-sport athlete at Jesuit High School in Carmichael, California, playing baseball, basketball, and football while maintaining a 4.0 grade-point average. Hoskins' parents dissuaded him from focusing entirely on one sport, instead encouraging him to follow a variety of activities. One of Hoskins' teammates at Jesuit was Zach Green, a shortstop who was highly sought after in the 2012 MLB Draft. Green typically batted third in the lineup, with Hoskins following at cleanup. Hoskins graduated high school in 2011, with a career .421 batting average, 28 runs batted in (RBIs), and a .544 on-base percentage.  College career Hoskins chose to pursue college baseball so that he could better develop the mental aspect of the game. He chose to attend California State University, Sacramento, the only college that offered him a scholarship, to play for the Sacramento State Hornets. As a freshman he batted .353 with a .567 slugging percentage (both 2nd in the conference), with 10 home runs and 53 RBIs (3rd), and was named Western Athletic Conference Freshman of the Year, National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association First Team Freshman All-American, Baseball America First Team Freshman All-American, Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American (Collegiate Baseball Newspaper), All-WAC second team, and Academic All-WAC. In 2013, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named a league all-star. As a junior he hit 12 home runs with 53 RBIs and a .573 slugging percentage (all leading the WAC), while batting .319, and was named WAC Player of the Year, Louisville Slugger Third Team All-American (Collegiate Baseball), Second Team All-West Region (ABCA/Rawlings), First Team All-WAC, and Academic All-WAC.  Professional career Minor league career The Philadelphia Phillies selected Hoskins in the fifth round, 142nd overall, of the 2014 MLB Draft, and he chose to sign with the team for a $349,700 signing bonus. Hoskins made his professional debut in 2014 with the Class A Short Season Williamsport Crosscutters of the New York–Penn League. In 70 games with the team, he batted .237 with nine home runs, but his performance was inconsistent. The Phillies' department of player development sent Hoskins to the Florida Instructional League that September, where he developed his signature left leg kick batting stance. Hoskins was assigned to the Class A Lakewood BlueClaws of the South Atlantic League (SAL) to begin the 2015 season. That May, after batting .342 with two home runs and 23 RBIs, the Phillies organization named Hoskins their Minor League Player of the Month. On June 23, Hoskins appeared in the SAL All-Star Game, going 1-for-3 with one run scored, and he finished second in the SAL Home Run Derby. Two days later, he and fellow BlueClaw All-Star Malquin Canelo were promoted to the Class A-Advanced Clearwater Threshers of the Florida State League. On August 24, Hoskins was named the Florida State League Player of the Week, after putting up 9 hits, including four doubles, one triple, and two home runs in seven games. Between the two teams, Hoskins batted .319 in 2015, with 17 home runs, 90 RBIs, and 86 runs scored in 567 plate appearances. After the season ended, Hoskins asked the Phillies if there were any winter baseball leagues that he could play in, as he wanted to keep his momentum from the season. He was assigned to the Sydney Blue Sox of the Australian Baseball League, where he batted .323 with eight home runs and a .561 slugging percentage  in 42 games. After his time in Australia, Hoskins began 2016 with the Double-A Reading Fightin Phils of the Eastern League. He and teammate Dylan Cozens made an immediate impression in Reading; by mid-June, they had combined for 36 home runs, the second-highest total by a pair of teammates in all of professional baseball - only Mark Trumbo and Manny Machado of the Baltimore Orioles ranked higher. By August, they were the first Reading teammates to hit 30 or more home runs in a single season, and Hoskins' and Cozens' performance at the plate generated a newfound enthusiasm among Reading baseball fans, who turned out to games to watch the two hit. Hoskins batted .281 in 2016, with 38 home runs, 116 RBIs, and 95 runs in 589 plate appearances. After the season, he was named the Eastern League Rookie of the Year, and received the Paul Owens Award alongside Cozens as the top players in the Phillies farm system. Hoskins opened the 2017 season playing with the Lehigh Valley IronPigs of the Class AAA International League. Hoskins started at first base for Team USA in the All-Star Futures Game. In a AAA season cut short by his call-up, he led the International League in RBIs (91), OPS (.966), on-base percentage (.385), and slugging percentage (.581), and ranked 2nd in runs (78), 3rd in home runs (29; setting the team's season record) and total bases (233), and 7th in batting average (.284) and walks (64). Hoskins was selected by the International League as its MVP, Rookie of the Year, and Midseason and Postseason All-Star Team first baseman, and was named Phillies Minor League Hitter of the Month for April.  He was also selected by Baseball America as the first baseman on the First Team of the Baseball America Minor League All-Star Team and a Triple A All Star, and an MiLB.com Phillies Organization All Star.  Philadelphia Phillies 2017 With regular outfielder Aaron Altherr injured, Hoskins began playing in left field with the IronPigs to prepare for a potential promotion to the major leagues. He was called up to the Phillies on August 10, 2017, with Cameron Perkins optioned to make room for Hoskins on the roster. He debuted the same day, going 0-for-2 with a walk in a 10–0 loss to the New York Mets. Manager Pete Mackanin moved Hoskins to the cleanup position after his first game, and on August 13, Hoskins had his first major league RBI and hit, in the first and fifth innings, respectively, of a 6–2 loss to the Mets. The next day, in a 7–4 loss to the San Diego Padres, Hoskins became the first Phillies player to hit his first two major league home runs in the same game since Scott Rolen in 1996.  Hoskins broke a series of records for rookie production. On August 26, after hitting a home run in seven consecutive days, Hoskins became the fastest player in recorded MLB history to reach 10 career home runs, doing so in 17 games. His 11th home run came the following day, after only 64 at bats, breaking Shane Spencer and Gary Sanchez' records of 11 home runs in 81 at bats. Additionally, he passed former Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard's record of 10 home runs in one month by a Phillies rookie, and was the first to hit a home run in five consecutive games since Chase Utley in 2008. In the same game, Hoskins turned a triple play from the outfield, the first Phillies player to do so in 53 years. On August 28, in his 19th career game, Hoskins recorded his 25th RBI in the second-fewest games since the statistic began being used in 1920. (in 1925, the Chicago Cubs' Mandy Brooks did so in 17 games.) In the same game, he hit a double and became the third rookie in franchise history to have extra-base hits in six consecutive games, joining Pinky Whitney in 1928 and Dick Allen in 1964. His 11 home runs in August were the most by a rookie in a month in Phillies history.  Hoskins's record-breaking streak continued on September 2, when he became the fastest player to hit 12 home runs, doing so in only 24 games. Hoskins was named the NL Rookie of the Month in August. Of his first 26 major league games, Hoskins played 20 in left field, even though he had played in the outfield only as a freshman during college and in only three minor league games.

Thomas Gordon (c. 1691 – 28 July 1750) was a Scottish writer and Commonwealthman. Along with John Trenchard, he published The Independent Whig, which was a weekly periodical. From 1720 to 1723, Trenchard and Gordon wrote a series of 144 essays entitled Cato's Letters, condemning corruption and lack of morality within the British political system and warning against tyranny. The essays were published as Essays on Liberty, Civil and Religious, at first in the London Journal and then in the British Journal. These essays became a cornerstone of the Commonwealth man tradition and were influential in shaping the ideas of the Country Party. His ideas played an important role in shaping republicanism in Britain and especially in the American colonies leading up to the American Revolution.  Zuckert argues, "The writers who, more than any others, put together the new synthesis that is the new republicanism were John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, writing in the early eighteenth century as Cato."  Life He was born in Kirkcudbright towards the end of the seventeenth century. He possibly attended the University of Aberdeen. He went to London as a young man and taught languages. Two pamphlets on the Bangorian controversy commended him to John Trenchard, a Whig politician; one was probably A Letter to the Lord Archbishop (i.e. William Wake) in 1719, who had written a Latin letter reflecting upon Hoadly, addressed to the church of Zurich. Gordon became Trenchard's amanuensis. Robert Walpole made Gordon first commissioner of the wine licenses, a post which he held till his death on 28 July 1750. Gordon was twice married, his second wife being Trenchard's widow.  Works A tract called the Independent Whig, published at the time of the rejection of the Peerage Bill (December 1719), was followed by a second part in January 1720, on the peace with Spain and the value of Gibraltar to England, several editions of which were issued. A weekly paper of the same name was then started, and carried on through the year, the articles by Trenchard, Gordon, and a third contributor, 'C.' [Anthony Collins], being distinguished in the fifth edition. It was first collected in one volume in 1721. To the fifth edition (1732) were appended 'The Craftsman,' a sermon, in the style of Daniel Burgess, also published separately, a letter to a 'Gentleman of Edinburgh,' and an epitaph on Trenchard. In a sixth edition (1735) there was added a third volume containing Gordon's letter to William Wake of 1719 and other tracts; a seventh edition appeared in 1743, and a fourth volume was added in 1747 containing tracts written during the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745. The book was mainly an attack on the High Church party, and on the title-page of later editions is called 'A Defence of Primitive Christianity ... against the exorbitant claims of fanatical and disaffected clergymen.' Thomas Wilson, bishop of Sodor and Man, tried to exclude it from his diocese, and got into trouble in consequence. It was translated into French by the Baron d'Holbach. In 1720 Gordon and Trenchard began the publication of Cato's Letters. They appeared in the London Journal and then in the British Journal until Trenchard's death in 1723, and were reprinted in 4 vols. in 1724. Gordon published, by subscription, a translation of Tacitus, in 2 vols. 1728 (dedications to the Prince of Wales and Walpole), which went through several editions, and seems to have been the standard translation till the end of the century. Edward Gibbon read it in his youth (Misc. Works, i. 41). John Nichols claimed that Gordon's commentaries on Tacitus were derivative from the work of Virgilio Malvezzi, Scipione Ammirato and Baltasar Alamos de Barrientos. In 1744 he published The Works of Sallust, with Political Discourses upon that author; to which is added a translation of Cicero's "Four Orations against Cateline." He published an 'Essay on Government' in 1747, and a 'Collection of Papers' by him appeared in 1748. Gordon also wrote a preface to a translation from Barbeyrac called 'The Spirit of Ecclesiastics in all Ages,' 1722. The unfinished draft of a History of England is now preserved in the British Library Manuscript Collections.  Vegetarianism Gordon, inspired by Bernard Mandeville, expressed strong disapproval with the mass killing of numerous animals for human consumption, stating, "it is very unreasonable that the whole Creation should be lavished away in this profuse Manner." He also argued that meat wasn't inherently the natural food for humans, asserting that it was merely cultural practices that led people to overcome their aversion to it and to disregard the cruelty inflicted upon animals during the slaughter process.

His political and philosophical views were near to Karl Kautsky's radical ideas. In 1904, he became member of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary, therefore he lost his job as a grammar school teacher in Kolozsvár.

Kunfi resigned from his position and called for the dictatorship's liquidation. After that he emigrated to Austria. He worked as editor-in-chief of the Arbeiter Zeitung. Kunfi committed suicide in Vienna. In Hungary, two days after his death, there was a nation-wide work stoppage in his memory. His ashes were reburied in Hungary in 1947.

On 31 August 2015, Soriano signed a contract with Napoli worth €13.5m with Juan Camilo Zúñiga set to join Sampdoria as part of the deal, but the transfer fell through because Napoli did not deposit the contract with Lega Serie A before the 23:00 deadline. It is believed the delay was mainly due to disputes about image rights.  Villarreal On 2 August 2016, Spanish club Villarreal CF and Sampdoria reached an agreement for the transfer of Soriano.

"Et si" is a song by French popstar Shy'm, from her fourth album Caméléon. It was chosen to be the third single from Caméléon and the radio edit of the song (which features less prominent guitars, and a more uptempo chorus) was released to iTunes on 5 November 2012. "Et si" (which translates to English as "And If") is a midtempo pop song in which Shy'm questions whether her love will last forever. It is one of the more ballad-like songs on the album. The album version primarily features guitar and piano, while the radio edit strips away the guitar and includes more synths.  Music video The music video for the song was shot in the French countryside, and switches between scenes in a house to scenes in a forest. At first, it focuses on Shy'm and her boyfriend in a country house, with friends arriving for a party of sorts. Throughout the house scenes, everyone ignores Shy'm, with some of her friends and her boyfriend nearly hitting her. It seems she is going through a breakup with her boyfriend until the final scene, in which everyone at the house travels to the woods. Shy'm is unsure of what they are doing there, until her boyfriend brushes the leaves off a grave. The grave is marked with Shy'm's real name, Tamara Marthe, and when she sees her name she breaks down into tears. Shy'm is actually a ghost, which is why nobody noticed her in the house. The video was premiered on YouTube on 20 December 2012, and has to date been viewed almost 3,000,000 times. It received a hugely positive reception from fans, with them appreciating the emotional content of the video and the nostalgic feel.  Chart performance The song entered the official French singles chart at #198 for the week ending 29 December 2012, following the release of its music video. The following week, it dropped out of the chart. On the week ending 6 January 2013, it re-entered the chart at #174, before reaching #106 on the week ending 13 January 2013. On the week ending 27 January 2013, it peaked at #51.  Charts References External links Shy'm Official site Shy'm Official MySpace

1984 is an opera by the American conductor and composer Lorin Maazel, with a libretto by J. D. McClatchy and Thomas Meehan. The opera is based on George Orwell's 1949 dystopian novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four. It premiered on 3 May 2005 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in a production directed by Robert Lepage.  History 1984 was the first opera composed by Maazel, following a conducting career that spanned more than 50 years; he was 75 years old when his work had its premiere. The opera was originally commissioned by August Everding, the director of the Bavarian State Opera, and Maazel later admitted surprise at the offer. "I'd never thought of writing an opera, and it took years to convince me," he stated in an interview prior to the premiere. After Everding died, it appeared the work might not proceed, but Maazel got it picked up by Covent Garden and the Tokyo Opera. This was to be a joint endeavour, but Tokyo ultimately backed out, leaving it in limbo again. Maazel then stepped in and paid about £400,000 to finance the project through a company he formed for the purpose, Big Brother Productions. By picking up nearly half the costs, he allowed the Royal Opera House to spend what it would for a typical revival from the standard repertoire, rather than a more expensive new production. This saved the opera from oblivion, but also led to charges that the Royal Opera House was spending taxpayer money to support a vanity project.  Cast In contrast with the conventions of most operas, 1984 casts the hero, Winston, as a baritone (sung by Simon Keenlyside at the premiere), while the lead tenor takes the role of the villain, O'Brien (sung by Richard Margison at the premiere). The part of Julia was sung by soprano Nancy Gustafson in the original production. Other individual parts in the opera include Syme, Parsons, and Charrington, a gym instructor/drunken woman, a prole woman, and a café singer. Maazel incorporates an important role for the chorus, which sings a "hate chorus" for the rallies Orwell called Two Minutes Hate, as well as a rousing "National Anthem of Oceania." The telescreen voice was spoken by Jeremy Irons. The children's chorus was provided by the New London Children's Choir.  Production team Production directed by Robert Lepage Set Designer: Carl Fillion Costume Designer: Yasmina Giguère Lighting: Michel Beaulieu Choreography: Sylvain Émard Assistant Director: Neilson Vignola Projection Designer: Jacques Collin Image Designer: Lionel Arnould Properties Designer: Patricia Ruel Sound Effects: Jean-Sébastien Côté Production Manager: Bernard Gilbert Technical Director: Michel Gosselin Technical Consultant: Tobie Horswill Producer for Ex Machina: Michel Bernatchez  Reviews The British press reviews for the London premiere were negative. Andrew Clements' review in The Guardian berated the effort, declaring that it was "both shocking and outrageous that the Royal Opera, a company of supposed international standards and standing, should be putting on a new opera of such wretchedness and lack of musical worth." Andrew Clark of the Financial Times stated that the "only reason we find this slick perversion of Orwell on the Covent Garden stage is because super-rich Maazel bought his way there by stumping up the production costs," while Rupert Christiansen in  The Daily Telegraph dismissed it as "operatic fast food." More sympathetic reviews appeared outside of the British media. Newsweek, which noted that, while the "score may occasionally sound more like an overblown film soundtrack than the meaty orchestration of an opera," the production "effectively conjures up the dispiriting emptiness of Orwell's awful vision. The unusual and inspired choice of a baritone, Simon Keenlyside, for the lead role of Winston, lends the work a darker edge." The Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia praised Maazel by stating "the maestro knows a lot of music and he shows it, just as he shows his prowess in orchestral and vocal work." The opera's Royal Opera House engagement was sold out, as was a later engagement at La Scala in Milan, Italy.  The production was recorded for DVD release. Since February 2009, the DVD is also available for sale in USA.  References External links Official website

Akil Kumarasamy is an American author and an assistant professor in the Masters of Fine Arts Program in Creative Writing at Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences-Newark. Her collection of short stories Half Gods won The Story Prize Spotlight Award and the 2021–2022 Annual Bard Fiction Prize. Her novel Meet Us by the Roaring Sea was released in August 2022.  Early life and education Kumarasamy grew up in Dismal Swamp, New Jersey, in a largely South Asian community. She had no pets and no direct access to wildlife as a child, but initially wanted to be a zoologist. Bhavye Doye writes for Open Magazine that Kumarasamy "grew up among migrants and refugees who had packed their belongings and sorrows when they were cleaved from their homelands, and embodied within themselves a subcontinent of unarticulated experiences." She graduated from Barnard College in 2010 and completed her Masters of Fine Arts in creative writing at the University of Michigan.  Career In fall 2020, Kumarasamy became an assistant professor in the MFA program in creative writing at Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences-Newark. Her past teaching experience includes the Helen Zell Writers' Program at the University of Michigan. Her fellowships include the University of East Anglia, the Provincetown Fine Arts Work Center, Yaddo, and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. She was awarded the Annual Bard Fiction Prize for her collection of short stories Half Gods, which includes an appointment as a writer in residence at Bard College for a semester during the 2021–2022 academic year. After an interview with Kumarasamy, Zena Agha writes for the Asian American Writers' Workshop Magazine, "Hearing about her literary journey confirmed to me that success for women writers is not a finite thing. Kumarasamy, like those who came before and those who will come after, is engaged in the radical act of speaking poetic truths to people who are unaccustomed to listening to them." Kumarasamy discussed the impact of her childhood experience on her writing with Urvashi Bahuguna of Scroll.in, stating, "I think that gave me a more nuanced take on brownness. Instead of seeing it in the margins, I was able to view it from a place of centrality." In addition Half Gods, she wrote a novel, titled Meet Us by the Roaring Sea, that was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in August 2022.  Critical reception Half Gods Half Gods was named in the "Best of 2018: Short story collections" by Scroll.in, one of "6 Summer Books That Explore the Immigrant Experience" by The Village Voice, and an Editor's Choice by The New York Times, as well as featured on the "Lest We Forget: A Reading List" by PEN America, "Four terrific fiction debuts by Asian-American women not to miss" by USA Today, and "Short Story Collections That Should Be on Your Must-Read List" by Redbook. In a review for The New York Times, Tania James writes, "As Akil Kumarasamy pointed out in a 2017 interview, the Tamil equivalent of goodbye is poyittu varen, meaning “I’ll go and return." These are parting words especially suited to the refugee: ever running away, ever looking back. Kumarasamy poignantly illustrates this tension in her debut story collection". In a review for the Hindustan Times, Sonali Mujumdar writes that the novel "has its primordial roots in that tumultuous time, but the larger canvas is about exile, adopted cultures, about families and people that have crossed continents to make new lives, colliding awkwardly with each other in their chosen lands," and "Kumarasamy rips open wounds, lays them bare, washes and wipes, and secures her creations; disjointed pieces of trauma and treasures, that come together to piece an irregular whole. Here the mortals too have feet of clay in a world full of poetic injustice." Katy Waldman writes for The New Yorker, "The book doubles as a chilling history lesson for readers unfamiliar with the bloody conflict between Sri Lanka’s Tamils, a northern minority, and its Sinhalese majority," and "More than a hundred thousand people were slain in the Sri Lankan civil war, between 1983 and 2009." Michael Patrick Brady writes for The Millions, "More than 800,000 people were displaced, with many fleeing the country as refugees to India, the United Kingdom, and the United States," and "Kumarasamy explores what it means to be made to feel like a foreigner in one’s own country, a theme made all the more affecting by recent events."  Publishers Weekly states, "Kumarasamy’s prose is gorgeous and assured, capable of rendering both major tragedy (war, the dissolution of a marriage, the loss of a child) and minor tragedy (a botched effort at matchmaking, a pitying Christmas invitation) with care and precision. Though the stories can sometimes blend together, the writing is strong throughout, resulting in a wonderful, auspicious debut." Aditya Sudarshan writes in a review for The Hindu, "Half Gods is certainly an extraordinary achievement, even an epochal one. Perhaps never before in history could such a work have been created, a humanly conceived book-as-machine, properly intimidating in its refusal to explain itself, and feigning to satisfy a profound human desire, by making the stuff of our little lives into something rich and dense."  Kalyan Nadiminti writes for the Los Angeles Review of Books, "Notwithstanding its allusive opacity and predictable prose, Kumarasamy's debut moves in the right direction, provoking serious questions about the writing of human rights and the ways in which literature bears the burden of representing unsolvable political problems." Kirkus Reviews writes, "While the book is moving and the writing elegant and clear, the collection begins to feel almost like a writing exercise, moving from third-person to first-person and back; when it finally comes to the rarely used second person [...], the effect isn't nearly as surprising as it might otherwise have been. It might be that Kumarasamy's control on the stories is too tight. One wonders what might happen if she were to loosen her grip."  Meet Us by the Roaring Sea A Publishers Weekly review states, "Kumarasamy's dazzling if sometimes unwieldy debut novel [...] follows a young woman as she tries to unpack the past amid an unforgiving near future", and "Kumarasamy's gorgeous prose and quiet meditations on memory will enthrall readers." In the Kenyon Review, Elinam Agbo describes the novel as "a lyrical, speculative novel set in a near future where violence is as unrelenting a reality as it is in our present moment."  Melissa Chadburn writes for The New York Times that the book "alternates between the near-future, second-person perspective of Aya, a 26-year-old A.I. trainer in Queens, and passages from a manuscript she is translating from Tamil into English", and "Kumarasamy’s quirky language and wit are dazzling." In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Ilana Masad writes that the book, "is under 300 pages, and there is certainly a lot going on, but it all feels beautifully balanced — chapters threaded together nimbly, the translated manuscript and the protagonist’s life echoing each other."  Jonathan Russell Clark describes the novel in a review for the Star Tribune as "a brazenly complex, labyrinthinely structured, deeply philosophical, thematically ambitious novel, and although it may not be the breeziest read, it is also a masterpiece that more than confirms the promise of "Half Gods."" In the Chicago Review of Books, Malavika Praseed writes, "this is a book that commands a greater focus and closer attention than I anticipated as a reader. And while individual passages shimmer and terrify, the book as a whole leaves dangling threads that go beyond the unanswered questions of thought-provoking narrative. We never truly comprehend our protagonist, just as our protagonist rarely seems to comprehend the world around her." Meet Us by the Roaring Sea is on the shortlist for the 2023 Ursula K.

Branchville is a neighborhood of the town of Ridgefield in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States, and is also the name of a Metro North railroad station (Branchville station). Branchville was listed as a census-designated place (CDP) prior to the 2020 census. Some people consider Branchville a part of Georgetown, an adjoining, non-incorporated community at the intersection of Redding, Ridgefield, Wilton and Weston, noting many residences and businesses there share Georgetown's 544- telephone number exchange. Others disagree, pointing to a community vote in the 1950s not to be served by the Georgetown Post Office, which is closer than the Ridgefield Post Office. The Branchville CDP is only in the town of Ridgefield.  History Branchville was named for the Danbury and Norwalk Railroad's “branch” line extending west to Ridgefield village, a four-mile (6.4 km) run on a long incline [Branchville's elevation is 342 feet (104 m) while the old village station was about 900 feet (270 m) above sea level]. Native Americans had previously referred to the southeast corner of present-day Ridgefield as Wheer Cock. Later it was called Copps Corner, after the Norwalk man who surveyed the town in the early 18th century and was the first town clerk. When workers completed in 1852 the railroad line from Norwalk to Danbury, the neighborhood was at first called Beers Station or Ridgefield Station, after the stop there. The first recorded use of the term Branchville appears in an 1870 deed for 4 acres (16,000 m2) “lying in the town of Ridgefield at Branchville.” It was the same year that the branch line was built, suggesting that the railroad rather than neighborhood residents had invented the name to distinguish the station from the new one at Ridgefield center. Previously, the station at Branchville had been known as Ridgefield Station or Beers Station. An 1893 atlas labels this territory as “Plattsville,” possibly a mapmaker’s error. While the area had been mostly farmland and a mill or two, the coming of the railroad sparked the development of a booming, albeit small-scale, industrial community. It included mills, stores, a hotel, a machinery factory, and a post office. In 1876, after A.N. Fillow began extracting mica at Branchville, two Yale University mineralogists noted the presence of previously undiscovered minerals lodged in pegmatite there and furnished funds to expand the operation. Historians say the mine produced between seven and nine minerals until then unknown. Over time, the mine would produce quantities of quartz, feldspar, mica, beryl, spodumene and columbite. Passenger service on the Ridgefield branch line continued until 1925; freight service lasted until 1964. Most of the track bed, complete with gravel but missing its rails, is today the path of the Eversource Energy high-voltage line and the town’s “Rail-Trail,” developed in the 1990s for walkers. Some of the other sections along southern Florida Road have been sold to adjoining landowners.  Education Branchville had its own school district at least since the middle 18th century – it was known as the “Ridgefield Station District” before it was called Branchville. Its schoolhouse was used until around fall of 1937 when children started being bused to Garden School on Bailey Avenue in the village. A new Branchville School opened in 1969 on lower Florida Road, remaining in use until in 1983 when it was closed due to declining enrollments and used as Ridgefield Board of Education offices. In 1994, faced with increasing enrollments, voters agreed to reopen the school.  Weir Farm Weir Farm National Historic Site in Ridgefield and Wilton is considered part of Branchville. Administered by the National Park Service, Weir Farm commemorates the life and work of impressionist painter Julian Alden Weir and other artists who stayed at the site, with notable visitors having included Childe Hassam, Albert Pinkham Ryder, John Singer Sargent and John Twachtman. Artist Sperry Andrews would later lead efforts to preserve the Weir Farm site, with the U.S. government designating it a National Historic Site in 1990. In 1882, Weir acquired a 153-acre farm from Erwin Davis in exchange for $10 and a painting. Weir and artists he hosted subsequently produced a large number of paintings depicting Branchville and surrounding landscapes. Weir Farm is slated to represent Connecticut on a commemorative quarter to be issued in 2020 by the U.S. Mint.  References External links Branchville history Web page at History of Redding Web site

In crystallography and the theory of infinite vertex-transitive graphs, the coordination sequence of a vertex                         v                 {\displaystyle v}     is an integer sequence that counts how many vertices are at each possible distance from                         v                 {\displaystyle v}    . That is, it is a sequence                                    n                        0                             ,                    n                        1                             ,                    n                        2                             ,         …                 {\displaystyle n_{0},n_{1},n_{2},\dots }     where each                                    n                        i                                     {\displaystyle n_{i}}     is the number of vertices that are                         i                 {\displaystyle i}     steps away from                         v                 {\displaystyle v}    . If the graph is vertex-transitive, then the sequence is an invariant of the graph that does not depend on the specific choice of                         v                 {\displaystyle v}    . Coordination sequences can also be defined for sphere packings, by using either the contact graph of the spheres or the Delaunay triangulation of their centers, but these two choices may give rise to different sequences.  As an example, in a square grid, for each positive integer                         i                 {\displaystyle i}    , there are                         4         i                 {\displaystyle 4i}     grid points that are                         i                 {\displaystyle i}     steps away from the origin. Therefore, the coordination sequence of the square grid is the sequence                         1         ,         4         ,         8         ,         12         ,         16         ,         20         ,         …                   .                 {\displaystyle 1,4,8,12,16,20,\dots \ .}     in which, except for the initial value of one, each number is a multiple of four. The concept was proposed by Georg O. Brunner and Fritz Laves and later developed by Michael O'Keefe. The coordination sequences of many low-dimensional lattices and uniform tilings are known. The coordination sequences of periodic structures are known to be quasi-polynomial.   == References ==

Nine Types of Light is the fourth studio album by American rock band TV on the Radio, released on April 11, 2011, through Interscope Records. It is the final TV on the Radio album to feature bassist Gerard Smith, who died of lung cancer nine days after it was released. The album's lead single "Will Do" was released on February 23, 2011. Its closing track, "Caffeinated Consciousness", was made available on the band's website as a free download on March 10, 2011. Nine Types of Light was very well received by critics and has a "Universal Acclaim" rating of 82 at review aggregating website Metacritic.  Film The band created an accompanying film to go with the album, an hourlong visual companion that offers music videos for all of Nine Types of Light's tracks. Packaged with a deluxe version of the CD, the film also exists on YouTube in its entirety. Characterized by eclectic visual style and thematic content as well as TV on the Radio's diverse, unique sound, the film allows for a different interpretation and method of experiencing the album. Directed by singer Tunde Adebimpe (with different directors helming the individual clips, see below for list), the film also features interviews with a variety of New Yorkers discussing topics including dreams, love, fame, and the future. A humorous epilogue, set to the song "You" and featuring the band members meeting for lunch ten years after a fictional breakup, concludes the film. Overall, the work can be seen as Afrofuturistic, particularly the video for "Will Do," which incorporates virtual-reality technology to tell a unique love story starring Adebimpe and Joy Bryant.

Cachuma Lake is a reservoir in the Santa Ynez Valley of central Santa Barbara County, California on the Santa Ynez River adjoining the north side of California State Route 154. The artificial lake was created by the construction of Bradbury Dam, a 201 ft (61 m) earth-fill structure built by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in 1953. Its surface area covers 3,100 acres (1,300 ha), with a maximum design capacity of 205,000 acre⋅ft (253,000,000 m3), but it is currently limited to 188,000 acre⋅ft (232,000,000 m3) due to sediment accumulation. The late-December 2022 and early-January 2023 storms dramatically raised the water level in the lake, from an average of 33% full to 100% full for the first time in 12 years.  History Built by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in 1953, the name "Cachuma" comes from a Chumash village that the Spanish spelled "Aquitsumu", from the Barbareño Chumash word aqitsu'm, meaning "sign". The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation oversees the lake’s operations and maintenance. Five agencies that stretch from Santa Ynez to Carpinteria take water from Cachuma. The Central Coast Water Authority (CCWA) extension of the California Aqueduct completed in 1997, is a 30–39-inch  diameter pipeline (76–99 cm) that travels 42 miles (68 km) from Vandenberg Space Force Base through Vandenberg Village, Lompoc, Buellton, and Solvang and terminates at Cachuma.  Water Levels The water levels of the lake are highly variable, spilling in some years and receding to less than 10% of capacity in dry years. Drought conditions can cause shortage in water supplies, as did the 2011-17 drought. In October 2016, the lake approached low levels not seen since the construction of Bradbury Dam. The lake level reached a minimum of 646.42 ft (197.03 m) on October 14, more than 106 ft (32 m) below the spillway elevation. At this time, the storage volume was only 14,057 acre-feet (17,339,000 m3), approximately 7.3% of capacity. In January and February 2017, a series of frequent rains raised the water level substantially. On one day, February 17, 2017, the lake rose by 25 feet (7.6 m) during the storm alone, followed by further increases from storm runoff. By the end of February 2017, the Lake had become 44.5% full, with a total volume of 85,979 acre-feet (106,054,000 m3). The Lake's water level declined again during the 2017-18 water year, with the Lake receding to less than one-third of its capacity. By March 28, 2019, above-normal precipitation had restored Lake Cachuma to 78.0% of its capacity. Despite an abnormally dry January and February 2020, a wet March and April brought the lake to 77% of capacity as of April 7, 2020. Several consecutive atmospheric river storms coming in from the Pacific in late-December, 2022 and early-January, 2023 dramatically raised the water level in the lake, from an average of 33% full in late December, to nearly 100% full by January 15, 2023 for the first time in 12 years. Further storms in February resulted in flood warnings for portions of Lompoc close to the river due to the water being released from the dam.  Climate Recreation Santa Barbara County Parks offers cabin and yurt rentals, as well as RV, tent, and group camping. Gasoline and groceries are available at the general store. There is a full boat and kayak rental facility with a bait and tackle shop where fishing licenses can be purchased. The lake is stocked with rainbow trout throughout the winter season, and fishing is open all year from shore or boat. There are five miles of hiking trails within the park, and Los Padres National Forest trails close by. A large campsite on the south shore of Cachuma Lake is administered by the Santa Barbara County Park's division of the Community Services Department. The University of California, Santa Barbara rowing team regularly practices and races at Cachuma Lake and erected a permanent boathouse there just prior to the 1982-1983 school year. The lake is also a popular destination for viewing bald eagles from seasonal tour boats. Body contact activities such as swimming, wading, or water skiing in Cachuma Lake have been restricted since the park opened in the 1950s, reasoning that the lake was a reservoir people depend upon for drinking water. In May 2011, the no body contact regulation was revised to allow human-powered recreational watercraft such as kayaks and canoes on the lake as well as allow dogs on boats and eliminate "incidental body contact" with the water as a punishable offense. Solvang, California is approximately 10.5 mi (16.9 km) to the west of Lake Cachuma. The town of Santa Ynez, California is approximately 7.25 mi (11.67 km) to the west of Bradbury Dam.  Natural history activities and programs Santa Barbara County Parks offers a variety of natural programs including wildlife lake cruises, nature walks, junior ranger programs, campfire programs on summer weekends, and a family-oriented live animal event in the fall. School and community group environmental education field trips are available all year.  Neal Taylor Nature Center Located in Santa Barbara, the Neal Taylor Nature Center, formerly the Cachuma Lake Nature Center, features exhibits and hands-on displays about the area's cultural and natural history, including local plants, animals, birds and geology. The nature center is open year-round and admission is free. The center offers youth and adult workshops and lectures as well as school and youth nature education programs in partnership with the Santa Barbara County Parks natural history programs.

The history of Styria concerns the region roughly corresponding to the modern Austrian state of Styria and the Slovene region of Styria (Štajerska) from its settlement by Germans and Slavs in the Dark Ages until the present. This mountainous and scenic region, which became a centre for mountaineering in the 19th century, is often called the "Green March", because half of the area is covered with forests and one quarter with meadows, grasslands, vineyards and orchards. Styria is also rich in minerals, soft coal and iron, which has been mined at Erzberg since the time of the Romans. The Slovene Hills (Slovene: Slovenske gorice, German: Windische Bühel) is a famous wine-producing district, stretching between Slovenia and Austria. Styria was for long the most densely populated and productive mountain region in Europe. Styria's population before World War I was 68% German-speaking, 32% Slovene, bordered on (clockwise) Lower Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Carniola, Carinthia, Salzburg, and Upper Austria. In 1918 after World War I the southern, Slovene-speaking third south of the Mur River was incorporated into Slovenia in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The remaining two-thirds became the Austrian federal state of Styria, while the Slovene-speaking third (Lower Styria) formed the informal Styria region in Slovenia, now divided into the Drava and Savinja Statistical Regions and the major part of Slovenian Carinthia. The capital both of the duchy and the Austrian state has always been Graz, which is now also the residence of the governor and the seat of the administration of the land.  Political history Prehistory to Charlemagne The Roman history of Styria is as part of Noricum and Pannonia, with the romanized Celtic population of the Taurisci. During the great migrations, various Germanic tribes settled and/or traversed the region using the river valleys and low passes, but about 600 CE the Slavs took possession of the area and settled assimilating the remaining autochthonous romanized population. When Styria came under the hegemony of Charlemagne as a part of Carantania (Carinthia), erected as a border territory against the Avars and Slavs, there was a large influx of Bavarii and other Christianized Germanic peoples, whom the bishops of Salzburg and the patriarchs of Aquileia kept faithful to Rome. Bishop Vergilius of Salzburg (745-84), was largely instrumental in establishing a church hierarchy in the Duchy and gained for himself the name of "Apostle of Carantania." In 811 Charlemagne made the Drave River the boundary between the dioceses of Salzburg and Aquileia.  Middle Ages The March of Styria was created in the Duchy of Carinthia in the late 10th century as a defence against the Magyars. Long called the Carantanian or Carinthian March it was soon ruled by a margravial dynasty called the Otakars that originated from Steyr in Upper Austria thus giving the land its name: "Steiermark". This march was raised to become a duchy by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1180 after the fall of Henry the Lion of Bavaria. With the death of Ottokar the first line of rulers of Styria became extinct; the region fell successively to the Babenberg family, rulers of Austria, as stipulated in the Georgenberg Pact; after their extinction to the control of Hungary (1254–60); to King Ottokar of Bohemia; in 1276 to the Habsburgs, who provided it with Habsburgs for Styrian dukes during the years 1379-1439 and 1564–1619. At the time of the Ottoman invasions in the 16th and 17th centuries the land suffered severely and was depopulated. The Turks made incursions into Styria nearly twenty times; churches, monasteries, cities, and villages were destroyed and plundered, while the population was either killed or carried away into slavery.  Modern era The Semmering Railway, completed in 1854, was a triumph of engineering in its time, the oldest of the great European mountain railways. It was remarkable for its numerous and long tunnels and viaducts spanning mountain valleys, running from Gloggnitz in Lower Austria to Mürzzuschlag in Styria, and passing through the area's scenery. The railway brought tourists to alpine lake resorts and mineral springs at Rohitsch (today's Rogaška Slatina) and Bad Gleichenberg, the brine springs of Bad Aussee, and the thermal springs of Tuffer (today's Laško), Neuhaus am Klausenbach and Tobelbad. Following World War I, Styria was divided by the Treaty of Saint Germain. Lower Styria with the cities of Celje and Maribor became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, while the rest remained with Austria as the State of Styria. Other than in Carinthia, no fighting resulted from this, in spite of a German minority in Slovenia (the larger cities of Lower Styria were largely German-speaking). Lower Styria was reattached to the Reichsgau Steiermark from 1942 to 1945, whence it was returned to Germany. After World War II, Styria became part of the British occupation zone in Austria. The lower third was granted to Yugoslavia and today, it makes up about the eastern third of Slovenia.  Religious history The Protestant Reformation made its way into the country about 1530. Duke Karl (ruling 1564–90), whose wife was the Catholic Duchess Maria of Bavaria, introduced the Counter-Reformation into the country; in 1573 he invited the Jesuits into Styria and in 1586 he founded the Catholic University of Graz. In 1598 his son and successor Ferdinand suppressed all Protestant schools and expelled the teachers and preachers: Protestant doctrines were maintained only in a few isolated mountain valleys, as in the valley of the Inn and the valley of the Mur. On a narrow reading of the Peace of Augsburg, 1555, with its principle of cuius regio, eius religio, only the nobility were not forced to return to the Roman Church; each could have Protestant services privately in his own house. After Ferdinand had become Holy Roman Emperor in 1619 and had defeated his Protestant opponents in the Battle of White Mountain near Prague in 1620, he forbade all Protestant church services whatsoever (1625). In 1628 he commanded the nobility also to return to the Catholic faith. A large number of noble families, consequently, emigrated from the country. But most of them either returned, or their descendants did so, becoming Catholics and recovering their possessions. In the second half of the 17th century renewed action against the Protestants in the isolated mountain valleys resulted in the expulsion of Protestant ministers with the peasants who would not give up Protestantism; about 30,000 chose compulsory emigration to Transylvania over conversion. Only an Edict of Toleration issued by Emperor Joseph II as late as 1781 put an end to religious repression. The Protestants then received the right to found parish communities and to exercise their religion in those enclaves undisturbed. In 1848, all the provinces of the Habsburg monarchy received complete liberty of religion and of conscience, parity of religions, and the right to the public exercise of religion. Ecclesiastically the province was historically divided into two Catholic prince-bishoprics, Seckau and Lavant. From the time of their foundation both were suffragans of the Archdiocese of Salzburg. The Prince-Bishopric of Seckau was established in 1218; since 1786 the see of the prince-bishop has been Graz. The Prince-Bishopric of Lavant with its bishop's seat at Sankt Andrä in the Carinthian Lavant Valley was founded as a bishopric in 1228 and raised to a prince-bishopric in 1446. In 1847 the bishop's seat was transferred from St. Andrä to Maribor, and after World War I the see's boundaries were adapted to the new political frontiers. A short-lived third Salzburg suffragan diocese of Leoben comprising 157 parishes in the districts of Leoben and Bruck an der Mur existed on Styrian soil from 1786 but was incorporated into the diocese of Graz-Seckau in 1856 Today the see of the bishop of Graz-Seckau is identical in territory with the Austrian State of Styria.

Christian Dustmann, FBA, is a German economist who currently serves as Professor of Economics at the Department of Economics of University College London. There, he also works as Director of the Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration (CReAM), which he helped found. Dustmann belongs to the world's foremost labour economists and migration scholars.  Biography Dustmann earned a B.Sc. in business economics from the University of Bielefeld in 1983, followed by a M.A. in economics from the University of Georgia (Athens, Georgia) in 1985 and a M.Sc. in business economics from the University of Bielefeld in 1985. Thereafter, Dustmann went on to obtain a Ph.D. in economics from the European University Institute in Florence in 1992 and finally a habilitation in economics and econometrics from the University of Bielefeld in 1997. After his Ph.D., Dustmann briefly worked at the University of Bielefeld as assistant professor of economics from 1992 to 1994 and then moved to the University College London, where he has been working ever since, being promoted from lecturer to reader in 2002 and finally to full professor in 2004. In 2004, Dustmann also founded the Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration, whose director he remains. In parallel, he has held many visiting appointments, including at Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and Yale. In terms of professional affiliations and memberships, Dustmann is a research associate of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Centre for Economic Policy, research fellow of the Centre for Economic Policy Research, member of the Council of the Royal Economic Society, elected fellow of the Academia Europaea, National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, Society of Labor Economists and British Academy. Moreover, in the past, he has served as president of the European Society for Population Economics and of the European Society for Labour Economists. Besides working as referee for numerous academic journals in economics, Dustmann performs  editorial duties for the Journal of Labor Economics and has done so before for the Journal of Population Economics and the Economic Journal. In addition to his positions in academia, Dustmann has advised the British Home Office, the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, and the Economic and Social Research Council.  Research Christian Dustmann's research interests include various topics within labour economics, including migration, inequality and education. Many of Dustmann's contributions to research in these areas are summarized in his edited volume on the economics of education and training (with Bernd Fitzenberger and Stephen Machin), his chapter on migration and education with Albrecht Glitz in the Handbook of the Economics of Education and in his edited volume on migration. According to IDEAS/RePEc, he ranks among the top 1% most cited economists worldwide.  Research on the economics of migration The economics of temporary and return migration One of the most important topics within Dustmann's research on migration concerns return migration (a.k.a. temporary migration). Using SOEP data, Dustmann finds that immigrants' duration of stay in Germany, i.e. whether or not they immigrate permanently, affects the convergence of natives' and immigrants' earnings as permanent immigrants' tend to invest more into country-specific human capital and, under certain circumstances, immigrants with higher ability are more likely to immigrate permanently. As a consequence, Dustmann argues that governments need to clarify as early as possible whether permanent immigration is possible and under which conditions. In further work (partly with Oliver Kirchkamp), Dustmann finds that return migration is affected by the relative volatility of labour markets in host and home countries and migrants' precautionary savings, by their education and the family bounds they have established prior to emigration (for Turkish Guest Workers), by the number and sex of children they have had in the host country, and by the wage differentials between Germany and their home countries. Moreover, he and Kirchkamp observe that the majority of returnees from Germany to Turkey among Turkish Guest Workers remained economically active, typically as entrepreneurs. With regard to the UK, Dustmann and Yoram Weiss explore how price differentials between the UK and migrants' home countries, migrants' preference to live in their home countries, and better opportunities to accumulate valuable human capital in the UK determine return migration. Moreover, in research with Josep Mestres, Dustmann finds that changes in return plans are related to large changes in immigrants' remittances to their home countries. Finally, along with Itzhak Fadlon, Weiss and Dustmann use a Roy model to explore the effect of return migration and skill-specific human capital accumulation on the brain drain in migrants' home countries, which may instead experience a "brain gain" if enough emigrants return after having strongly improved their skills abroad.  The effect of immigrants' host country language skills A second major area of research in Dustmann's work on migration relates to the effect of immigrants' host country language proficiency. Among else, he finds that fluency in German among immigrants increases in education, is lower for the elderly and women, and is only improved by labour market participation in the case of speaking. He also finds that immigrants' fluency in both speaking and especially writing German is associated with higher earnings. In another study, Dustmann observes that immigrants' acquisition of speaking and writing fluency is mostly driven by their parents' education level, whereas living in areas with high concentrations of immigrants has only a moderately negative effect. Furthermore, migrants' investments into language proficiency are shown to depend on whether migrants' intend to immigrate permanently or temporarily. In work with Arthur van Soest, Dustmann finds that the effect of language proficiency on immigrants' earnings was likely underestimated by earlier studies as the downward bias due to measurement errors in subjective language proficiency dominates the upward bias due to heterogeneity in terms of unobserved ability. Finally, together with Francesca Fabbri, Dustmann documents that language acquisition and labour market performance vary widely across non-white immigrants in the UK based on their ethnic origins and that English proficiency significantly increases immigrants' likelihood of employment and earnings.  Natives' attitudes towards immigration Together with Ian Preston, Dustmann has analysed the attitudes of ethnic majorities towards ethnic minorities. Among else, they find that earlier research in the UK likely overestimated the positive impact of local immigration on natives' attitudes towards immigrants because they omitted the tendency of xenophobic natives to move to locations with few migrants; instead, they find that, if anything, high concentrations of ethnic minorities likely exacerbated xenophobia in England. With David Card, they also find that xenophobic attitudes among European natives are mainly driven by concerns over how changes in the composition of the local population due to immigration may affect amenities from neighbourhoods, schools and workplaces, instead of concerns over wages and taxes, thus explaining why individuals with lower education tend to display more xenophobic attitudes, as they benefit relatively more from these public amenities than highly educated people. This dominance of welfare concerns over labour market concerns is also supported by earlier work on the UK, though racial and cultural prejudice also plays an important role there, if immigrants have a different ethnicity.  The effects of immigration on host countries and immigrants A fourth area in Dustmann's research on migration studies the impact of immigration on domestic labour markets. Therein, together with Fabbri and Preston, Dustmann finds that while immigration in Britain overall doesn't appear to have an effect on British natives' employment, labour force participation, unemployment, and wages, immigration in fact likely decreased the employment of medium-skilled natives and increased that of high-skilled natives. In further work with Albrecht Glitz and Tommaso Frattini, Dustmann studies how European countries' labour markets adjusted to recent immigration through changes in factor prices, output mix and production technology. This research is further complemented by work with Glitz, Yann Algan and Alan Manning that compares the performance of first- and second-generation immigrants in France, Germany and the UK in terms of education, earnings and employment, as well as by research with Frattini and Gianandrea Lanzara which shows that even though second-generation immigrants tend to perform worse than natives in terms of education, immigration has a strongly positive on their education relative to that of their peers in their home country. More recently, Dustmann, Frattini and Caroline Halls have also analyzed the fiscal effects of immigration in the UK, finding that European immigrants in general and especially immigrants from post-2004 EU Member States have made consistently positive contributions to the UK's public finances between 1995 and 2011, though the opposite holds true for non-EEA immigrants, in particular before 2000. Finally, together with Frattini and Preston, Dustmann finds that immigrants' move to the UK generally results in a considerable downgrade of their position within the wage distribution, which then in turns depresses slightly wages among the bottom fifth of native workers but increases wages for the upper half.  Other research in labour economics In parallel to his research on the economics of migration, Dustmann has also performed influential research on various other topics in labour economics, including wages, job benefits, education, and structural change:  Produced a 2003 paper for the Home Office which predicted "net immigration from the AC-10 to the UK after the current enlargement of the EU will be relatively small, at between 5,000 and 13,000 immigrants per year up to 2010". Addressing the issue of endogeneity in education, experience and hours worked, Dustmann and van Soest find consistently positive private-public wage differentials in Germany; Dustmann and Uta Schönberg find no evidence that expanding maternity leave coverage in Germany improved children's educational outcomes, though it strongly decreased mothers' probability to return to work; Dustmann, Glitz and Schönberg explore how referral-based job networks lead to German firms' tendency to workers from certain ethnic groups the higher the share of the firm's workers that are already from that group, with such referral-based hires typically earning higher workers and being less likely to quit; Dustmann, van Soest and Najma Rajah find that reducing class size in England and Wales increases individuals' future wages by strongly increasing students' likelihood of staying in school after the end of compulsory schooling; Dustmann, Schönberg and Johannes Ludsteck argue skill-biased technological change increased inequality at the top of the German wage distribution in the 1980s and 1990s, whereas they attribute the growth of inequality at the bottom of the wage distribution to a combination of de-unionization and the increase in the relative supply of low-skilled workers following German reunification; Dustmann and Costas Meghir find that while the earnings of skilled workers in Germany benefit from experience and firm tenure, those of unskilled workers benefit only from firm tenure but hardly from experience and not at all from sector tenure; Dustmann, Schönberg, Bernd Fitzenberger and Alexandra Spitz-Oener argue that the main reason for the resurgence of Germany's economy since the mid-2000s has been the flexibility of its labour market institutions such as work councils and short-term work.  Recognition Dustmann is a Fellow of the British Academy. In 2021 he was named a Fellow of the Econometric Society.

The Paterson Bros. art decorating firm, consisting of brothers James, Charles Stewart and Hugh Paterson, was established in Melbourne in 1873. (From the 1870s, the term ‘art decorator’ in Australia implied the work of a decorator who strove to achieve a balance of beauty and functionality in interior ornamentation). Due to the prosperity in Victoria following the gold rush of the 1850s, talented art decorators from around the world made their way to Victoria during the 1870s and 1880s, forming a large and distinct group of cosmopolitan artists who enriched the interiors of many private and public buildings across the state.  The Paterson Brothers James Paterson was born in Dundee, Scotland and trained as an apprentice with Purdie, Bonnar and Carfrae, the most eminent house painters and decorators in Scotland before travelling to Australia in 1873.   James Paterson became the first President of the Painters and Decorators Guild. Hugh Paterson was born at Kirkcaldy, Scotland and was educated at the Grammar School, Musselburgh. He began decorating with his brother James upon his arrival in Australia in 1873 while also studying art at the Melbourne National Gallery. In 1879, Hugh returned to Scotland for two years where he worked as a figure decorator with Cornelius, a famous art decorator in Scotland. In 1886, Hugh Paterson returned to Scotland with scenic artist George Gordon, with the purpose of studying the best European art to apply to their ever growing business in Melbourne (see excerpt from The Austral Chronicle : a bi-weekly journal below). Hugh’s skills set went beyond art decoration as he was regarded as a fine costume designer in the Commonwealth. He was the designer of the costumes for the 1891 Leslie production of ‘Cinderella’ which were then used during the subsequent London, Berlin and St. Petersburg performances.  Works in Melbourne The Paterson Brothers rose to prominence through the reputation of the firm’s work at the 1880 Melbourne International Exhibition at the Royal Exhibition Building and for the art decorations of William Kerr Thompson’s mansion, Kamesburgh in North Brighton in 1880-81. The firm was soon  engaged to paint and decorate notable Melbourne landmarks such as the Library at State Parliament House in 1882,  the ballroom and private apartments of Government House in 1890, the Melbourne Town Hall in 1887, the South Melbourne Town Hall, the Union Bank, Colonial Bank, the Royal Bank and the residences of Messrs. Langdale, Mackinnon, Bowes Kelly, Langhee, H. T Payne, Andrew Chirnside, Everade Browne, Sybil Curne, Charles Ayrer and F.S. Grimwade. Other notable commissions included The Palace Hotel in Bourke St, Bracknell in Toorak for Matthew Davis, and the recently restored Victorian Trades Hall "Old" Chamber (1884, restored 2020). In 1883-84 the Paterson Bros. were also commissioned by William Greenlaw to lavishly decorate the interior of Villa Alba Museum, Kew C.S. Paterson opened Melbourne’s first custom-designed artists’ residential studios in Collins Street in April 1888 and naturally titled the fashionable new building ‘Grosvenor Chambers’. Two of its earliest tenants were the local women artists, Clara Southern and Jane Sutherland.   == References ==

The Union Credit Union was a credit union chartered to serve union members. A national advocate for unions and union members, it was headquartered in Spokane, Washington, United States. It closed operations in October 2010. In 1968 members of Bricklayers Local 3 founded The Union Credit Union as a not-for-profit means of obtaining loans and saving money. The credit union served only trade union members and was named Inland Empire Trades Credit Union. Today members from any union can belong and bank at The Union Credit Union. The families of union members, union employers and unions could also hold accounts and obtain loans at The Union Credit Union. The Union Credit Union received media attention in 2008 for a series of advertisements using the phrase "It just works for me" without a logo or name attached.  Advocacy The credit union's mission was to provide union members with a not-for-profit banking alternative. The Union Credit Union was the only remaining credit union in the United States run by an all union staff, board and management. The credit union had positioned itself as an advocate against union-affiliated credit unions merging into community chartered credit unions resulting in the loss of services to union members.  Employees The Union Credit Union had an all union staff, an all union volunteer board of directors, and the CEO was also a union member. Demaris Krummel was the CEO of The Union Credit Union.  Services The Union Credit Union allowed union members to skip loan payments during difficult times, including union strike. Members could obtain Step-Up Loans for tools, job training or college. The credit union also handled payroll for union shops.  Partnerships The Union Credit Union had partnerships with the following unions to serve their members:  Washington State Labor Council Asbestos Workers Local 82 Bricklayers Local 3 (Spokane/Montana) Carpenters Local 98 Cement Masons Communications Workers of America Local 7818 Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 44 Roofers Local 189 Sheet Metal Workers Local 66 Inland Northwest Apprenticeship Coordinators Council Inland Northwest Electrical Training Trust Spokane Regional Labor Council Washington Federation of State Employees United Steelworkers of America  Grant program The Step-Up Program was a consumer financial education and workforce development program to help the 2.7 million union workers in Washington state to take the next step up in life. Below market rate, not-for-profit Step-Up Loans were offered to union workers at their place of employment and union halls. The loans were used to cultivate new skills and obtain tools that supported workforce development. The program was conceptualized from the historical writings of Edward Filene’s vision in founding both unions and credit unions in the United States to serve the employees of Filene's Department Store. Filene was an advocate for workers' rights and supported his staff in collective bargaining. He also was a founder of the Chamber of Commerce - understanding what was good for employees was also good for business.

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE, nicknamed "The Big Board") is an American stock exchange in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City. It is the largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization. The NYSE trading floor is located at the New York Stock Exchange Building on 11 Wall Street and 18 Broad Street and is a National Historic Landmark. A previous trading room, at 30 Broad Street, was closed in February 2007. The NYSE is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, an American holding company that it also lists (NYSE: ICE). Previously, it was part of NYSE Euronext (NYX), which was formed by the NYSE's 2007 merger with Euronext. According to a Gallup poll conducted in 2022, approximately 58% of American adults reported having money invested in the stock market, either through individual stocks, mutual funds, or retirement accounts.  History The earliest recorded organization of securities trading in New York among brokers directly dealing with each other can be traced to the Buttonwood Agreement. Previously, securities exchange had been intermediated by the auctioneers, who also conducted more mundane auctions of commodities such as wheat and tobacco. On May 17, 1792, twenty-four brokers signed the Buttonwood Agreement, which set a floor commission rate charged to clients and bound the signers to give preference to the other signers in securities sales. The earliest securities traded were mostly governmental securities such as War Bonds from the Revolutionary War and First Bank of the United States stock, although Bank of New York stock was a non-governmental security traded in the early days. The Bank of North America, along with the First Bank of the United States and the Bank of New York, were the first shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1817, the stockbrokers of New York, operating under the Buttonwood Agreement, instituted new reforms and reorganized. After sending a delegation to Philadelphia to observe the organization of their board of brokers, restrictions on manipulative trading were adopted, as well as formal organs of governance. After re-forming as the New York Stock and Exchange Board, the broker organization began renting out space exclusively for securities trading, which previously had been taking place at the Tontine Coffee House. Several locations were used between 1817 and 1865, when the present location was adopted. The invention of the electrical telegraph consolidated markets and New York's market rose to dominance over Philadelphia after weathering some market panics better than other alternatives. The Open Board of Stock Brokers was established in 1864 as a competitor to the NYSE. With 354 members, the Open Board of Stock Brokers rivaled the NYSE in membership (which had 533) "because it used a more modern, continuous trading system superior to the NYSE's twice-daily call sessions". The Open Board of Stock Brokers merged with the NYSE in 1869. Robert Wright of Bloomberg writes that the merger increased the NYSE's members as well as trading volume, as "several dozen regional exchanges were also competing with the NYSE for customers. Buyers, sellers and dealers all wanted to complete transactions as quickly and cheaply as technologically possible and that meant finding the markets with the most trading, or the greatest liquidity in today's parlance. Minimizing competition was essential to keep a large number of orders flowing, and the merger helped the NYSE maintain its reputation for providing superior liquidity." The Civil War greatly stimulated speculative securities trading in New York. By 1869, membership had to be capped, and has been sporadically increased since. The latter half of the nineteenth century saw rapid growth in securities trading. Securities trade in the latter nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was prone to panics and crashes. Government regulation of securities trading was eventually seen as necessary, with arguably the most dramatic changes occurring in the 1930s after a major stock market crash precipitated the Great Depression. The NYSE has also imposed additional rules in response to shareholder protection controls, e.g. in 2012, the NYSE imposed rules restricting brokers from voting uninstructed shares.: 2  The Stock Exchange Luncheon Club was situated on the seventh floor from 1898 until its closure in 2006.  On April 21, 2005, the NYSE announced its plans to merge with Archipelago in a deal intended to reorganize the NYSE as a publicly traded company. NYSE's governing board voted to merge with rival Archipelago on December 6, 2005, and became a for-profit, public company. It began trading under the name NYSE Group on March 8, 2006. On April 4, 2007, the NYSE Group completed its merger with Euronext, the European combined stock market, thus forming NYSE Euronext, the first transatlantic stock exchange. Wall Street is the leading U.S. money center for international financial activities and the foremost U.S. location for the conduct of wholesale financial services. "It comprises a matrix of wholesale financial sectors, financial markets, financial institutions, and financial industry firms" (Robert, 2002). The principal sectors are securities industry, commercial banking, asset management, and insurance. Prior to the acquisition of NYSE Euronext by the ICE in 2013, Marsh Carter was the Chairman of the NYSE and the CEO was Duncan Niederauer. Currently, the chairman is Jeffrey Sprecher. In 2016, NYSE owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc. earned $419 million in listings-related revenues.  Notable events 20th century The exchange was closed shortly after the beginning of World War I (July 31, 1914), but it partially re-opened on November 28 of that year in order to help the war effort by trading bonds, and completely reopened for stock trading in mid-December. On September 16, 1920, the Wall Street bombing occurred outside the building, killing forty people and injuring hundreds more. The Black Thursday crash of the Exchange on October 24, 1929, and the sell-off panic which started on Black Tuesday, October 29, are often blamed for precipitating the Great Depression. In an effort to restore investor confidence, the Exchange unveiled a fifteen-point program aimed to upgrade protection for the investing public on October 31, 1938. On October 1, 1934, the exchange was registered as a national securities exchange with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with a president and a thirty-three-member board. On February 18, 1971, the non-profit corporation was formed, and the number of board members was reduced to twenty-five.  One of Abbie Hoffman's well-known publicity stunts took place  in 1967, when he led members of the Yippie movement to the Exchange's gallery. The provocateurs hurled fistfuls of dollars toward the trading floor below. Some traders booed, and some laughed and waved. Three months later the stock exchange enclosed the gallery with bulletproof glass. Hoffman wrote a decade later, "We didn't call the press; at that time we really had no notion of anything called a media event."  On October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped 508 points, a 22.6% loss in a single day, the second-biggest one-day drop the exchange had experienced. Black Monday was followed by Terrible Tuesday, a day in which the Exchange's systems did not perform well and some people had difficulty completing their trades. Subsequently, there was another major drop for the Dow on October 13, 1989—the Mini-Crash of 1989. The crash was apparently caused by a reaction to a news story of a $6.75 billion leveraged buyout deal for UAL Corporation, the parent company of United Airlines, which broke down. When the UAL deal fell through, it helped trigger the collapse of the junk bond market causing the Dow to fall 190.58 points, or 6.91 percent. Similarly, there was a panic in the financial world during the year of 1997; the Asian Financial Crisis. Like the fall of many foreign markets, the Dow suffered a 7.18% drop in value (554.26 points) on October 27, 1997, in what later became known as the 1997 Mini-Crash but from which the DJIA recovered quickly. This was the first time that the "circuit breaker" rule had operated.  21st century On January 26, 2000, an altercation during filming of the music video for Rage Against the Machine's "Sleep Now in the Fire", directed by Michael Moore, caused the doors of the exchange to be closed and the band to be escorted from the site by security after the members attempted to gain entry into the exchange. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the NYSE was closed for four trading sessions, resuming on Monday, September 17, one of the rare times the NYSE was closed for more than one session and only the third time since March 1933. On the first day, the NYSE suffered a 7.1% drop in value (684 points); after a week, it dropped by 14% (1,370 points). An estimated $1.4 trillion was lost within five days of trading. The NYSE was only 5 blocks from Ground Zero. On May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its largest intraday percentage drop since the crash on October 19, 1987, with a 998-point loss later being called the 2010 Flash Crash (as the drop occurred in minutes before rebounding). The SEC and CFTC published a report on the event, although it did not come to a conclusion as to the cause. The regulators found no evidence that the fall was caused by erroneous ("fat finger") orders. On October 29, 2012, the stock exchange was shut down for two days due to Hurricane Sandy. The last time the stock exchange was closed due to weather for a full two days was on March 12 and 13, 1888. On May 1, 2014, the stock exchange was fined $4.5 million by the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle charges that it had violated market rules. On August 14, 2014, Berkshire Hathaway's A Class shares, the highest priced shares on the NYSE, hit $200,000 a share for the first time. On July 8, 2015, technical issues affected the stock exchange, halting trading at 11:32 am ET. The NYSE reassured stock traders that the outage was "not a result of a cyber breach", and the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that there was "no sign of malicious activity". Trading eventually resumed at 3:10 pm ET the same day. On May 25, 2018, Stacey Cunningham, the NYSE's chief operating officer, became the Big Board's 67th president, succeeding Thomas Farley. She is the first female leader in the exchange's 226-year history. In March 2020, the NYSE announced plans to temporarily move to all-electronic trading on March 23, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Along with the PHLX and the BSE, the NYSE reopened on May 26, 2020.  Building The main New York Stock Exchange Building, built in 1903, is at 18 Broad Street, between the corners of Wall Street and Exchange Place, and was designed in the Beaux Arts style by George B. Post. The adjacent structure at 11 Wall Street, completed in 1922, was designed in a similar style by Trowbridge & Livingston. The buildings were both designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978. 18 Broad Street is also a New York City designated landmark.  Official holidays The New York Stock Exchange is closed on New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth National Independence Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. When those holidays occur on a weekend, the holiday is observed on the closest weekday. In addition, the Stock Exchange closes early on the day before Independence Day, the day after Thanksgiving, and Christmas Eve. The NYSE averages about 253 trading days per year.  Trading The New York Stock Exchange (sometimes referred to as "The Big Board") provides a means for buyers and sellers to trade shares of stock in companies registered for public trading. The NYSE is open for trading Monday through Friday from 9:30 am – 4:00 pm ET, with the exception of holidays declared by the Exchange in advance. Proposals for round-the-clock trading have been considered by NYSE. The NYSE trades in a continuous auction format, where traders can execute stock transactions on behalf of investors. They will gather around the appropriate post where a specialist broker, who is employed by a NYSE member firm (that is, they are not an employee of the New York Stock Exchange), acts as an auctioneer in an open outcry auction market environment to bring buyers and sellers together and to manage the actual auction. They do on occasion (approximately 10% of the time) facilitate the trades by committing their own capital and as a matter of course disseminate information to the crowd that helps to bring buyers and sellers together. The auction process moved toward automation in 1995 through the use of wireless handheld computers (HHC). The system enabled traders to receive and execute orders electronically via wireless transmission. On September 25, 1995, NYSE member Michael Einersen, who designed and developed this system, executed 1000 shares of IBM through this HHC ending a 203-year process of paper transactions and ushering in an era of automated trading.  As of January 24, 2007, all NYSE stocks can be traded via its electronic hybrid market (except for a small group of very high-priced stocks). Customers can now send orders for immediate electronic execution, or route orders to the floor for trade in the auction market. In the first three months of 2007, in excess of 82% of all order volume was delivered to the floor electronically. NYSE works with US regulators such as the SEC and CFTC to coordinate risk management measures in the electronic trading environment through the implementation of mechanisms like circuit breakers and liquidity replenishment points. Following the Black Monday market crash in 1987, NYSE imposed trading curbs to reduce market volatility and massive panic sell-offs. Following the 2011 rule change, at the start of each trading day, the NYSE sets three circuit breaker levels at levels of 7% (Level 1), 13% (Level 2), and 20% (Level 3) of the average closing price of the S&P 500 for the preceding trading day. Level 1 and Level 2 declines result in a 15-minute trading halt unless they occur after 3:25 pm, when no trading halts apply. A Level 3 decline results in trading being suspended for the remainder of the day. (The biggest one-day decline in the S&P 500 since 1987 was the 11.98% drop on March 16, 2020.)  Floor seats Until 2005, the right to directly trade shares on the exchange was conferred upon owners of a limited number of "seats". The term comes from the fact that up until the 1870s NYSE members sat in chairs to trade. In 1868, the number of seats was fixed at 533, and this number was increased several times over the years. In 1953, the number of seats was set permanently at 1,366. These seats were a sought-after commodity as they conferred the ability to directly trade stock on the NYSE, and seat holders were commonly referred to as members of the NYSE. Seat prices varied widely over the years, generally falling during recessions and rising during economic expansions. In January 1927 the cost of seat reached a then-record $185,000. The most expensive inflation-adjusted seat was sold in 1929 for $625,000, which, today, would be over six million dollars. In recent times, seats have sold for as high as $4 million in the late 1990s and as low as $1 million in 2001. In 2005, seat prices shot up to $3.25 million as the exchange entered into an agreement to merge with Archipelago and became a for-profit, publicly traded company. Seat owners received $500,000 in cash per seat and 77,000 shares of the newly formed corporation. The NYSE now sells one-year licenses to trade directly on the exchange. Licenses for floor trading are available for $40,000 and a license for bond trading is available for as little as $1,000 as of 2010. Neither are resellable, but may be transferable during a change of ownership of a corporation holding a trading license. The Barnes family is the only known lineage to have five generations of NYSE members: Winthrop H. Barnes (admitted 1894), Richard W.P. Barnes (admitted 1926), Richard S. Barnes (admitted 1951), Robert H. Barnes (admitted 1972), Derek J. Barnes (admitted 2003).  NYSE Composite Index In the mid-1960s, the NYSE Composite Index (NYSE: NYA) was created, with a base value of 50 points equal to the 1965 yearly close. This was done to reflect the value of all stocks trading at the exchange, in contrast with the then predominant Dow Jones Industrial Average which tracks just 30 stocks. To raise the profile of the composite index, in 2003, the NYSE set its new base value of 5,000 points equal to the 2002 yearly close. Its close at the end of 2013 was 10,400.32.  Timeline In 1792, NYSE acquires its first traded securities. In 1817, the constitution of the New York Stock and Exchange Board is adopted. It had also been established by the New York brokers as a formal organization. In 1863, the name changed to the New York Stock Exchange. In 1865, the New York Gold Exchange was acquired by the NYSE. In 1867, stock tickers were first introduced. In 1885, the 400 NYSE members in the Consolidated Stock Exchange withdraw from Consolidated over disagreements on exchange trade areas. In 1896, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is first published in The Wall Street Journal. In 1903, the NYSE moves into new quarters at 18 Broad Street. In 1906, the DJIA exceeds 100 on January 12. In 1907, Panic of 1907. In 1909, trading in bonds begins. In 1915, basis of quoting and trading in stocks changes from percent of par value to dollars. In 1920, a bomb exploded on Wall Street outside the NYSE building. Thirty-eight killed and hundreds injured. In 1923, Poor's Publishing introduced their "Composite Index", today referred to as the S&P 500, which tracked a small number of companies on the NYSE. In 1929, the central quote system was established; Black Thursday, October 24 and Black Tuesday, October 29 signal the end of the Roaring Twenties bull market. In 1938, NYSE names its first president. In 1943, the trading floor is opened to women while men were serving in WWII. In 1949, the third longest (eight-year) bull market begins. In 1954, the DJIA surpasses its 1929 peak in inflation-adjusted dollars. In 1956, the DJIA closes above 500 for the first time on March 12. In 1957, after Poor's Publishing merged with the Standard Statistics Bureau, the Standard & Poors composite index grew to track 500 companies on the NYSE, becoming known as the S&P 500. In 1966, NYSE begins a composite index of all listed common stocks. This is referred to as the "Common Stock Index" and is transmitted daily. The starting point of the index is 50. It is later renamed the NYSE Composite Index. In 1967, Muriel Siebert becomes the first female member of the New York Stock Exchange. In 1967, protesters led by Abbie Hoffman throw mostly fake dollar bills at traders from gallery, leading to the installation of bullet-proof glass. In 1970, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation was established. In 1971, NYSE incorporated and recognized as Not-for-Profit organization. In 1971, the NASDAQ was founded and competes with the NYSE as the world's first electronic stock market. To date, the NASDAQ is the second-largest exchange in the world by market capitalization, behind only the NYSE. In 1972, the DJIA closes above 1,000 for the first time on November 14. In 1977, foreign brokers are admitted to NYSE. In 1980, the New York Futures Exchange was established. In 1987, Black Monday, October 19, sees the second-largest one-day DJIA percentage drop (22.6%, or 508 points) in history. In 1987, membership in the NYSE reaches a record price of $1.5 million. In 1989, On September 14, seven members of ACT-UP, The AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, entered the NYSE and protested by chaining themselves to the balcony overlooking the trading floor and unfurling a banner, "SELL WELCOME", in reference to drug manufacturer Burroughs Wellcome. Following the protest, Burroughs Wellcome reduced the price of AZT (a drug used by people living with HIV and AIDS) by over 30%. In 1990, the longest (ten-year) bull market begins. In 1991, the DJIA exceeds 3,000. In 1995, the DJIA exceeds 5,000. In 1996, real-time ticker introduced. In 1997, on October 27, a sell-off in Asia's stock markets hurts the U.S. markets as well; DJIA sees the largest one-day point drop of 554 (or 7.18%) in history. In 1999, the DJIA exceeds 10,000 on March 29. In 2000, the DJIA peaks at 11,722.98 on January 14; first NYSE global index is launched under the ticker NYIID.  In 2001, trading in fractions (n⁄16) ends, replaced by decimals (increments of $0.01, see Decimalization); September 11 attacks occur causing NYSE to close for four sessions. In 2003, NYSE Composite Index relaunched and value set equal to 5,000 points. In 2006, NYSE and ArcaEx merge, creating NYSE Arca and forming the publicly owned, for-profit NYSE Group, Inc.; in turn, NYSE Group merges with Euronext, creating the first trans-Atlantic stock exchange group; DJIA tops 12,000 on October 19. In 2007, US President George W. Bush shows up unannounced to the Floor about an hour and a half before a Federal Open Market Committee interest-rate decision on January 31; NYSE announces its merger with the American Stock Exchange; NYSE Composite closes above 10,000 on June 1; DJIA exceeds 14,000 on July 19 and closes at a peak of 14,164.53 on October 9. In 2008, the DJIA loses more than 500 points on September 15 amid fears of bank failures, resulting in a permanent prohibition of naked short selling and a three-week temporary ban on all short selling of financial stocks; in spite of this, record volatility continues for the next two months, culminating at 5+1⁄2-year market lows. In 2009, the second longest and current bull market begins on March 9 after the DJIA closes at 6,547.05 reaching a 12-year low; DJIA returns to 10,015.86 on October 14.

On February 5, the DJIA dropped 1,175 points, making it the largest point drop in history. In 2020, the NYSE temporarily transitioned to electronic trading due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Merger, acquisition, and control In October 2008, NYSE Euronext completed acquisition of the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) for $260 million in stock. On February 15, 2011, NYSE and Deutsche Börse announced their merger to form a new company, as yet unnamed, wherein Deutsche Börse shareholders would have 60% ownership of the new entity, and NYSE Euronext shareholders would have 40%. On February 1, 2012, the European Commission blocked the merger of NYSE with Deutsche Börse, after commissioner Joaquín Almunia stated that the merger "would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide". Instead, Deutsche Börse and NYSE would have to sell either their Eurex derivatives or LIFFE shares in order to not create a monopoly. On February 2, 2012, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse agreed to scrap the merger. In April 2011, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), an American futures exchange, and NASDAQ OMX Group had together made an unsolicited proposal to buy NYSE Euronext for approximately US$11,000,000,000, a deal in which NASDAQ would have taken control of the stock exchanges. NYSE Euronext rejected this offer twice, but it was finally terminated after the United States Department of Justice indicated their intention to block the deal due to antitrust concerns. In December 2012, ICE had proposed to buy NYSE Euronext in a stock swap with a valuation of $8 billion. NYSE Euronext shareholders would receive either $33.12 in cash, or $11.27 in cash and approximately a sixth of a share of ICE. Jeffrey Sprecher, the chairman and CEO of ICE, will retain those positions, but four members of the NYSE board of directors will be added to the ICE board. On January 24, 2023, a glitch in NYSE caused panic due to unintentional trade orders opened and closed in more than 250 securities.  Opening and closing bells The NYSE's opening and closing bells mark the beginning and the end of each trading day. The opening bell is rung at 9:30 am ET to mark the start of the day's trading session. At 4 pm ET the closing bell is rung and trading for the day stops. There are bells located in each of the four main sections of the NYSE that all ring at the same time once a button is pressed. There are three buttons that control the bells, located on the control panel behind the podium which overlooks the trading floor. The main bell, which is rung at the beginning and end of the trading day, is controlled by a green button. The second button, colored orange, activates a single-stroke bell that is used to signal a moment of silence. A third, red button controls a backup bell which is used in case the main bell fails to ring. The ringing of the bells usually accompanied with applause and is often done by VIPs and celebrities (See pictures and the section "Notable bell-ringers").  History The signal to start and stop trading was not always a bell; a gavel was the original signal, which is still utilized alongside the bell. However, the gavel is frequently damaged. During the late 1800s, the NYSE decided to switch the gavel for a gong to signal the day's beginning and end. After the NYSE changed to its present location at 18 Broad Street in 1903, the gong was switched to the bell format that is currently being used. The bell itself was produced by Bevin Brothers in East Hampton, Connecticut, which is known colloquially as "Bell Town" for its history of bell foundries and metal toy manufacturing. A common sight today is the highly publicized events in which a celebrity or executive from a corporation stands behind the NYSE podium and pushes the button that signals the bells to ring. Due to the amount of coverage that the opening/closing bells receive, many companies coordinate new product launches and other marketing-related events to start on the same day as when the company's representatives ring the bell. It was only in 1995 that the NYSE began having special guests ring the bells on a regular basis; prior to that, ringing the bells was usually the responsibility of the exchange's floor managers.  Notable bell-ringers Many of the people who ring the bell are business executives whose companies trade on the exchange, usually to announce new products, acquisitions, mergers or public offerings. However, there have also been many famous people from outside the world of business that have rung the bell, such as the Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani and the President of South Africa Nelson Mandela. Two United Nations Secretaries General have also rung the bell. On April 27, 2006, Secretary-General Kofi Annan rang the opening bell to launch the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment. On July 24, 2013, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon rang the closing bell to celebrate the NYSE joining the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative. Celebrities that have rung the bell include athletes such as Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees and Olympic swimming champion Michael Phelps, entertainers such as rapper Snoop Dogg, members of ESPN's College GameDay crew, singer and actress Liza Minnelli and members of the rock band Kiss. In addition there have been many bell-ringers selected for their public contributions, such as members of the New York City Police Department and New York City Fire Department following the September 11 attacks, members of the United States Armed Forces serving overseas, and participants in various charitable organizations. Several fictional characters have rung the bell as well, including Mickey Mouse, the Pink Panther, Mr. Potato Head, the Aflac Duck, Gene and Jailbreak of The Emoji Movie, and Darth Vader.

The Buckinghamshire Railway was a railway company in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, England that constructed railway lines connecting Bletchley, Banbury and Oxford. Part of the route is still in use today as the Oxford to Bicester Line.  History Origins The origins of the Buckinghamshire Railway can be traced back to the gauge and territorial wars which took place in Buckinghamshire in the 1840s. The London and Birmingham Railway (L&B) had opened a standard gauge line from Euston to Tring on 16 October 1837, extending to Birmingham in September 1838. In June of that year, the Great Western Railway (GWR) opened the first part of its broad gauge line from Paddington to Bristol and a further branch from Didcot to Oxford had been opened by June 1844. The GWR subsequently looked to expand beyond Oxford by depositing bills for the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway and the Oxford and Rugby Railway which would take it into the heart of the Midlands.  Seeking to prevent the GWR from annexing Buckinghamshire into its empire, the L&B, supported by the Midland Railway, countered with the London, Worcester and South Staffordshire Railway from Tring to Wolverhampton via Aylesbury. The scheme included loop lines from Bicester to Oxford and Banbury to Rugby. A third company, Mark Huish's Grand Junction Railway, supported the GWR's schemes as a means of forcing the London and Birmingham to merge with it; it proposed a Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway which would join with the Oxford and Rugby at Fenny Compton. The GWR's schemes subsequently received Parliamentary approval, whilst the London and Birmingham was obliged to withdraw its proposal. The Grand Junction Railway's scheme was also passed, giving the GWR its route to Birmingham, and it merged with the L&B in 1846 to form the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). The remains of the loop lines became the Buckingham and Brackley Junction Railway and the Oxford and Bletchley Junction Railway.  Authorisation Three bills were presented to Parliament in 1846-47 for the formation of railway companies to construct the relics of the thwarted L&B and LNWR ambitions in Buckinghamshire. The first two bills were for the establishment of the Buckingham and Brackley Junction Railway and the Oxford and Bletchley Junction Railway to construct lines from Bletchley to Oxford via Winslow and Bicester, and another from a point near Claydon House to Brackley and Buckingham. The third bill was for the amalgamation of the two companies into the Buckinghamshire Railway and the authorisation of an extension from Buckingham to Banbury. The bills were passed and, under the direction of the LNWR, the Buckinghamshire Railway was formed on 22 July 1847. The second Duke of Buckingham was chairman until he encountered financial difficulties and was replaced by Sir Harry Verney, with Buckingham's son, the Marquess of Chandos, taking a seat on the board.  Later history Robert Stephenson was employed to construct the line, with Thomas Brassey as the civil engineering contractor. The line opened between Bletchley and Banbury (via Verney Junction) on 30 March 1850, and between Verney Junction and Oxford on 20 May 1851. The line was worked by the LNWR, which originally leased the line, eventually absorbing the Buckinghamshire Railway on 21 July 1879. The Buckinghamshire Railway made modest profits until its valuable freight was re-routed through Oxford and Didcot, leaving it to sink into losses from which it never re-emerged. It continued until the Chairman of the LNWR, Richard Moon, was elected to the board on 23 February 1878 and by 15 July in the same year the company's shares had been consolidated with those of the LNWR. In 1879, the LNWR also absorbed the Bedford Railway which had constructed a line between Bletchley and Bedford. It had already absorbed the Bedford and Sandy Railway in 1865, which had constructed a line between Bedford and Cambridge.  Present status The line between Oxford and Cambridge was subsequently known as the Varsity Line and that between Banbury and Bletchley was worked as a separate line, the Banbury to Verney Junction Branch Line. The second line closed to all traffic by the end of 1966, while the Bedford to Cambridge section of the first line was closed as from the beginning of 1968. The section from Bedford to Bletchley remains as the Marston Vale Line and that between Oxford and Bicester was closed, but reopened to passenger traffic in 1986.  Reopening plans As of March 2018, the Bicester Village - Oxford section of the line is in operation. By 2025, the line is scheduled to reopen from Bicester through Bletchley as far as Bedford, with a new station at Winslow. In the longer term, the route to Cambridge is to be re-established via a new junction with the East Coast Main Line, between Sandy and St Neots (near the site of the former Tempsford station). The Bedford–Cambridge section is to use a new route because the trackbed of the former Varsity Line has been built over.  References Notes Sources Awdry, Christopher (1990).

Pajštún Castle or Pajštún (Slovak: Pajštúnsky hrad,Hungarian: Pozsonyborostyánkő ,German: Peilenstein) is a ruined medieval castle in the municipality of Borinka in the Bratislava region of Slovakia. It is located on the western edge of the Little Carpathians at an altitude of 486 m. Because of its proximity to Bratislava, the castle is a popular hiking destination for the city's inhabitants.  History The exact origins of the Pajštún castle are unclear with some historians considering it to be the same castle as the Stupava castle. The castle is standing above Stupava but is not included in the administrative territory of this town. Other historians situate the origins of the castle in the last third 13th century with Rugerius of Tallesbrunn giving the order to build it. Pajštún was a part of a regional castle system aimed at defending the north-western border of the Kingdom of Hungary. The original name of the castle was probably the German Peilenstein. The current Slovak name, Pajštún, is likely a corrupted version of the original German word. One of the first known records mentioning the castle (or the village below) comes from 1314 in connection to its owner, Otto from Telesprun. Many sources often, mistakenly, date the first mention of the castle to 1273. The castle must have existed before 1390, when it was donated by Sigismund of Luxemburg as a hereditary property to Peter Szentgyörgyi. After this family died out in 1543, the castle was owned by Gáspár Serédy. Around 1550 the ownership of the castle was given to Eck Salm, a faithful servant of king Ferdinand I and the head of the Pozsony County. In 1592, with the consent of emperor Rudolf II, the pawned castle was paid of to the family Slam by Miklós Pálffy. Three years after his death in 1600, his widow, Mária Fugger, and his three sons received the royal donation of Pajštún castle. When the family property was divided in 1619, the Pajštún castle went to Pál Pálffy. As the condition of the castle had been progressively worsening, and with the looming Turkish danger at the time, Pálffy had the castle rebuilt between 1640 and 1645. He entrusted the most important Italian artists and builders available in the Habsburg monarchy with the reconstruction of the castle. The Italian engineer Filiberto Luchese led the renovation which fundamentally transformed the original 13th-century core of the castle. Approximately at the same time the manor house of Stupava was rebuilt as well. After the completion of this building the administration of the estate was gradually moved there. The owners of the castle soon started preferring other locations of greater convenience and Pajštún's significance and condition began to decline. This was aggravated by a large fire after Pajštún was hit by lightning in the mid-18th century which destroyed a large part of the castle. With its importance diminished, the repairs were merely provisional. The castle though was still inhabitable in the mid-18th century. During the Napoleonic wars the French troops occupied Bratislava and its environments. Although castles like Pajštún lost their strategic role in the 19th century, the French troops blew up the castle in June 1809 during the campaign against Vienna. The last owner of the castle, Lajos Károlyi, abandoned his properties including the ruins of the Pajštún castle along with other nearby mansions and possessions in 1945.  Architecture From the original medieval castle that stood on the top platform only some parts of the walls above the eastern precipice survive. The half-circle cannon bastion in the northern part of the fortification dates back to the  16th century rebuilding of the Pajštún castle. Located close to this cannon bastion, is a preserved armed corner of the castle gate. Most probably behind this gate the palace itself was located. The basement of the palace was incorporated in the rock on which the castle was built. During the Pálffy rule of the castle the entire castle was further altered. On the western side of the top plateau, the castle was closed by a palace with a forecastle which was in turn fortified with a series of bastions, artillery positions and a tapered cannon bastion. A two-floored tall entry building with an arched gate provided access to the forecastle. From the outside it was dissected by a trio of oriels supported by consoles and ornamented by early baroque masks. The remains of an arched underground cistern with a brick mantle on the upper platform of the castle also date back to this time period. The fragmented pieces of wall on the southern side are the only surviving parts of the southern palace that stood on top of this rock.  See also List of castles in Slovakia   == References ==

The video game industry in Mainland China currently is one of the major markets for the global video game industry, where more than half a billion people play video games. Revenues from China make up around 25% of the nearly US$100 billion global video game industry as of 2018, and since 2015 has exceeded the contribution to the global market from the United States. Because of its market size, China has been described as the "Games Industry Capital of the World" and is home to some of the largest video game companies. China has also been a major factor in the growth of esports, both in player talent and in revenue. China has not always been a major factor in the industry, having been on the verge of economic recovery during the industry's formulative years in the 1970s and 1980s. With the introduction of the second-generation home gaming consoles in the mid-1980s, a new black market of illegally-imported goods and video game clones arose to avoid the high costs of imports, driving away foreign companies. Notably, China imposed a near-complete ban on video game consoles in 2000, fearing the addiction-like impact of games on its youths; the ban was ultimately lifted in 2015. During that time, China's video game market greatly expanded in the area of computer games (including massively multiplayer online games, browser games, social network games, etc.) and later mobile games, all which could be free to play titles with monetization to appeal to the average lower income of Chinese players. This massive growth from 2007 to 2013 led the games' publishers and operating companies like Tencent and NetEase to become large global companies. Despite the legitimate growth of the industry, China's video game market continues to be offset by illegal importing, copyright violation and intellectual property theft. As with other parts of its media, China's government has strong oversight of the video game industry; all new titles go through a governmental approval process to assure that content aligns with the nation's values. In 2018, an approvals freeze due to the reorganisation of China's content vetting agencies caused numerous game releases to be held up. The video game market plummeted for a year. The government also fears the potential for its youths to become addicted to video games, and have required games to include anti-addiction measures. User verification is used to enforce playtime restrictions, which currently limit minors to three hours per week.  History Broadly, the growth of the video game market in China is tied to expansion of its technology and digital economy from the 1990s to present day, which by 2016 represented over 30% of its gross domestic product.  Initial growth (1980s–2000) At the time that the video game industry was being established in North America in the 1970s, China was in the midst of major political and economic reform following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976. The country was technologically behind much of the rest of the world in terms of its media. Part of the reform was modernization of its media systems, helping to boost economic prosperity for citizens. As such, China saw little of arcade games or the first generation of home consoles, like the Atari 2600. After the video game crash of 1983 which devastated the North American video game market, Japan became a dominant factor in the global market leading off the third generation of consoles such as Nintendo's Famicom. By this point, China's economy had significantly improved, and Japan started to make inroads into selling consoles into China. However, importing these into China was costly, with a 130% tariff on hardware and games along with value-added taxes. Console systems were in high demand, but because of the high costs of importing, only few foreign companies did so. This created the video game clone grey market in China – manufacturing of reverse-engineered consoles and games at much lower costs than imported system, even if this required dubious or illegal copyright infringement. Outright copyright theft ("piracy") was also rampant in China due to the country's poor intellectual property controls. The sales of cloned console hardware and games outpaced that of legitimate imports, and further drove many foreign companies away since they could not compete with this area, such that by the 1990s, most video game systems in China were manufactured there. Console games continued to grow in popularity through the 1990s, which created a broader concern in the media of video game addiction, with terms like "digital heroin" being used to describe video games. Even before the 1990s, there had been a broader stance in China that video games created negative effects on those that played them, which only grew during this decade. The impact on youth was particularly of concern, as video games were known to detract students from schoolwork, leaving them unprepared to enter China's college system. This situation was partially created by China's one-child policy, with sibling-less children having few others to interact with and little to do outside of school. The anti-addiction facet also discouraged foreign companies from trying to break into the Chinese market.  Chinese console ban (2000–2015) The concerns about video game addiction and negative influence on the youth came to a head in June 2000. The State Council passed a bill crafted by seven ministries specifically aimed at video games. The bill established certain provisions on video game content and regulations on operations of Internet cafés and arcades. The most significant facet of this bill was a ban on the production, import, and sale of consoles and arcade machines. This ban was not absolute, as it allowed for some consoles to be released in China, notably Sony's PlayStation 2 in 2004 and several of Nintendo's consoles rebranded under the iQue partnership. However, with the restriction on game imports and their content, these consoles did not catch on in China. The ban did not include games available on personal computers (PC), and as a result, the PC video game market in China flourished over the next fifteen years. Internet cafés flourished, growing from 40,000 in 2000 to over 110,000 by 2002, and have remained numerous since. The ban on arcade machines was dropped in 2009, but while arcade were permitted to operate, they had to take several safeguards to prevent excessive use by youth. However, since such arcades offered a low-cost way to play games without a PC, they still became a thriving industry comparable to PC gaming at internet cafés. As a result, Chinese gamers frequently visit the arcades to play action games, particularly fighting games, and occasionally unlicensed arcade ports of popular PC or mobile games such as Angry Birds or Plants vs. Zombies.  Online gaming (2004–2007) Legitimate acquisition of games and the hardware to play them was still relatively expensive in China, which continued to fuel the video game clone market in China. A large number of PC gamers in China acquired software through illegal downloads and pirated software websites to avoid the cost. Developers of legitimate games in China recognized that, to compete with this black market, they had to develop games that had a free or low upfront cost model but offered a way to monetize their games over time. Many Chinese-developed games became online games offering numerous microtransactions to recoup costs; such games could be offered at Internet cafés, which became a popular option for Chinese players that could not afford computer hardware, even as the price of computing equipment dropped over the next decade. This created a boom of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) in the Chinese market and which helped to establish market dominance of companies like Tencent, Perfect World, and NetEase. PC cafés proliferated in urban centers as China's population continued to grow. Western free-to-play and subscription-based games like Dota 2 and World of Warcraft, poised to take advantage of this model, also became successful. It also prompted Chinese developers to develop numerous clones of popular Western games that they would offer at low cost, an issue that still persists presently. Online gaming became of serious concern to the government around 2007, re-raising the issues of gaming addiction that had prompted the 2000 console ban. A government report claimed that 6% of teenage internet users, amounting to 3.5 million young people, were playing online games more than 40 hours a week. In July 2007, the government required that online game publishers and operates incorporate anti-addiction software on their games, specifically by monitoring how long underaged persons played. If a minor played for more than three hours straight, the game was to wipe half of any in-game currency that had earned that session, and lose all credits if played for more than five hours. Additionally, these systems were required to have the player to log in using their national identification. However, at the time of implementation, not all publishers incorporated the required controls, and for those that did, players would find ways around the limitations, such as using family member IDs, or otherwise would simply play past the time requirements as there was nothing else to do beyond the video game.  Social and mobile gaming (2008–2014) By 2007, the size of the Chinese video game market was estimated to be about US$1.7 billion with around 42 million players, having grown 60% from the previous year mostly driven by online gaming. At this stage, China's impact on the larger global market, valued at US$41.9 billion, was not considered significant, as much of it was still driven by the grey market for clones and pirated games. However, the rapid growth led to forecasts that China would be a major contributor to the global market within five-years time. Online gaming readily led way to the rise of social network games in China around 2007–2008, given that players were accustomed to free-to-play nature of online gaming. The Chinese game Happy Farm (2008) was included in Wired's list of "The 15 Most Influential Games of the Decade" at #14, for its major influence on global social network games, particularly for having "inspired a dozen Facebook clones", the largest being Zynga's FarmVille. A number of other games have since used similar game mechanics, such as Sunshine Farm, Happy Farmer, Happy Fishpond, Happy Pig Farm, Farm Town, Country Story, Barn Buddy, Sunshine Ranch, and Happy Harvest, as well as parodies such as Jungle Extreme and Farm Villain. This further prepared the China market for mobile games around 2012, where there are about one billion mobile phone subscriptions, according to a United Nations report, and after Apple secured deals to distribute their iPhones within China. Mobile devices in China are less expensive than computer or console hardware, and also provide Internet functionality; for many, they are the only form of Internet connectivity they have, making them popular gaming devices.  Mobile games in China grew rapidly over the next several years, growing from about 10% of the Chinese video game market in 2012 to 41% in 2016. This expanded to more than 50% by 2018. Furthering the growth of the social and mobile game markets was the fact that the anti-addiction measures applied to online games did not apply to these types of titles; it was not until 2017 where renewed concerns about mobile titles like Honour of Kings led Tencent to implement a similar anti-addiction system for its portfolio. Social and mobile gaming significantly grew the Chinese video game market beyond earlier estimates. By 2013, the Chinese market for video games saw nearly a ten-fold growth since 2007, valued at US$13.5 billion of the global US$83 billion, with over 490 million players, counting only those on personal computers; since consoles were still banned, these numbers do not take console players into account.  Lifting of the console ban (2014–2017) In 2014, China partially eased the restrictions on video game hardware by allowing game consoles to be manufactured in the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone (FTZ) and sold in the rest of China subject to cultural inspections. In July 2015, the ban on video game consoles within the country was completely lifted. According to a statement from the country's Ministry of Culture, companies like Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft – among others – were now allowed to manufacture and sell video game consoles anywhere in the country. Microsoft and Sony quickly took advantage of the lifting of the ban, announcing sales of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 platforms within the FTZ shortly after the 2014 announcement. Microsoft established a partnership with BesTV New Media Co, a subsidiary of the Shanghai Media Group, to sell Xbox One units in China, with units first shipping by September 2014. Sony worked with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Media in May 2014 to establish manufacturing in the FTZ, with the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita shipping into China by March 2015. CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Andrew House explained in September 2013 that the company intended to use the PlayStation Vita TV as a low-cost alternative for consumers in an attempt to penetrate the Chinese video game market. Both Microsoft and Sony have identified China as a key market for their next generation of consoles, the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 respectively. Nintendo did not initially seek to bring the Wii U into China; Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé stated that China was of interest to the company after the ban was lifted, but considered that there were similar difficulties with establishing sales there as they had recently had with Brazil. Later, Nintendo had teamed up with Tencent by April 2019 to help sell and distribute the Nintendo Switch as well as aid its games through the Chinese government approval process led by National Radio and Television Administration. The Nintendo Switch went on sale in China on December 10, 2019, though unlike the international version; this unit included several concessions to region-lock it to China. Even with the ban lifted, console sales were slow, as consoles require dedicated space in home and did not have additional functionality, like personal computers, and further slowed by continued popularity of Internet cafés. The hardware grey market also persisted, drawing away legitimate sales of consoles. Of the US$37.9 billion industry revenue in 2018, only about $1 billion was attributed to console sales. It is expected that as interest in legitimate sales of consoles increases in the future, the grey market will wane. Despite official availability of the Switch, imported and grey-market sales of Switch consoles still dominated China; while Nintendo and Tencent reported that a million Switch consoles had been sold by January 2021, the total number of Switch consoles in use within the country was estimated to be at least twice as high due to imported, non-region-locked versions.  Approvals freeze and further steps to restrict youth gaming (2018–present) In March 2018, after the structural re-organization of State Administration of Radio and Television (SART), over a period of several months, no new game licenses were given out. Further, MOC had made the process of getting these licenses more stringent. This period has significantly impacted Tencent, one of the largest publishers of video games for China. In August 2018, Tencent was forced to pull from sale their version of Monster Hunter World from China as they had not got their license for it and the government received complaints about its content. Tencent were also blocked from publishing personal computer versions of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Fortnite Battle Royale. The license freezes was reported to have significant effects on those game publishers and developers that rely on Chinese sales. In late August 2018, the Chinese Ministry of Education called on the Chinese government and SART to also address the growing issue of myopia in children which was attributed to long hours of gaming on small screens like with mobile devices. The Ministry of Education had asked SART to consider placing restrictions on the number of hours each young player can play a game. On news of this, Tencent shares lost 5% of their value, an estimated US$20 billion on the stock market, the next day. A further approval route was closed by Chinese authorities in October 2018; this "green channel" route, which had been in place by August 2018, allowed a game to have a period of one month on the market for purposes of consumer testing without having full government approval, but had been seen by game publishers as temporary relief from the current ban. Tencent had been planning on distributing and monetizing from Fortnite Battle Royale via this method before this route was closed. With China's effective ban of new games continuing into October 2018, Chinese players have found other routes of getting new games, which include using Steam which uses overseas servers. Further, existing titles released before the freeze that continue to offer new content have seen a resurgence in players and spending as a result. To comply with the planned new rules, Tencent announced that all mobile games it manages in China will require users to use their Chinese ID to play. This will be used by Tencent to track the time that minors play the game and implement time limitations on them, among other steps to meet new regulations. By December 2018, the Chinese government had formed the "Online Game Ethics Committee" falling under the National Radio and Television Administration, which will review all games to be published in China for appropriate content as well as issues related to childhood myopia. The committee, by the end of the year, had restarted the approval process and will be working through a backlog of submissions to review in an expedited manner to allow new games to be released. Initial approvals to 80 back-logged titles was granted within days, but notably lacked games published by Tencent and Netease, the two largest publishers in China. After several more rounds, Tencent had two games approved near the end of January 2019, but did not include either Fortnite Battle Royale or PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, two major titles that were financial drivers in other countries. A second freeze on approvals started in February 2019, as any further approvals on new games were suspending until the committee has been able to clear the backlog of the titles from the prior freeze. By this point, only about 350 games had been approved from the previous freeze. According to China's State Administration of Press and Publication, the freezes were put in place as the video game industry had grown too rapidly in China at a rate that passed the capabilities for regulation to keep up. The second freeze that started in February 2019 was to put in place to give regulators a change to tune the game approval process to meet the current market size. The freeze is expected to be lifted in April 2019, alongside a new set of regulations for game approvals. These new changes include limiting the number of games that can be approved each year to around 5,000 games, strictly banning video game clones and games with obscene content, and placing more anti-addiction controls on mobile titles aimed at younger players. The nearly year-long freeze has had rippling effects on the global video game industry. Whereas in 2017, around 9,600 new games were approved, only around 1,980 were approved within 2018. Tencent had been one of the top 10 companies in the world at the start of 2018, but by October, its stock had dropped in value by 40%, an estimated US$230 billion, and knocked the company out of the top ten. Apple attributed revenue loss in the fourth quarter of 2018 to China's approval freeze, which had also affected mobile video game apps. The freeze was expected to impact total revenues of the video game industry in 2019, with one analysis projecting a decline in revenue from the previous year, the first time in only a decade. The Chinese government continued to push on restrictions on gaming after the approvals freeze was lifted, asserting its efforts were to restrict the influence of gaming on youth. The government has place restrictions on the amount of time minors can play video games, first in 2019 to 90 minutes per day on weekdays and three hours on weekends, and then to only one hour per day on weekends by 2021. The government has required that all online games to implement strong authentication protocols developed by the government as to track players' time in a game as well. Additionally, the government banned minors under the age of 16 from registering for livestreaming services. Since March 2021, there had been new pressure on video games, kicked off by statements made by General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping during the annual Two Sessions meetings where he claimed that video games could have a bad influence on the minds of children who are psychologically immature. The government had stopped approval of games starting in August 2021 in an apparent new lockdown related to game content. The continued pressure by the government on the Chinese game sector started to take an effect on the economic valuation of the largest companies.  An article published by the state-owned newspaper Economic Information Daily published a report in August 2021 that initially stated that online video games were an "opium for the mind", that gaming addiction was on the rise, and that there should be stronger government regulations. While the article was pulled and later republished without the "opium" statement, its effects caused shares of Tencent to drop by 10% initially that day in trading, though had recovered some after the revised article was published. Similar drops were seen with NetEase and Bilibili. Later in September 2021, when both Tencent and Netease were notified by the government of an upcoming hearing and reminding them than violations of their youth gaming restrictions would be seriously dealt with, both companies' stocks dropped by about 10% due to fears that the government may be clamping down more on gaming in the future, including another potential approvals freeze. Over 200 Chinese game companies, including Tencent and NetEase, signed a statement that month pledging that they will work to regulate youth gaming under the government's new regulations, as well as to enforce new rules relating to games involved "effeminate" portrayal of men in games. As reported by the South China Morning Post, an internal memo sent by the state's gaming trade organization to game companies in September 2021 for purposes of training further clarified that that government saw video games not as "pure entertainment" but as a form of art and thus works that must uphold "a correct set of values" related to China's heritage and culture, and would be more restrictive in what games they would approve within the country. The memo described games that have "blurred moral boundaries", where the player has an option of being good or bad within the game, and suggested that such games may need instead to restrict players to a specific moral path. Further, the memo identified that games that gave a "revisionist" form of history, or appeared more Japanese than Chinese, would likely fail to be approved. According to the South China Morning Post, the approvals for new games persisted through the end of 2021, and due to the lack of approvals, more than 14,000 game-related companies were deregistered in China through 2021. The approvals freeze was lifted by April 2022 when new approvals were announced. Additionally, players within China reported that the government had modified the country's network so that the international version of Steam was inaccessible from within the country, leaving only the Steam China client with limited selection of games that were already approved by the government. The government also banned the live streaming of unapproved games in April 2022. A report issued in November 2022 by research firm CNG and the China Game Industry Group Committee, both with strong associations with the Chinese regulatory bodies, stated that the steps taken to reduce youth video game addiction had been working, with more than 70% of the country's youth gaming less than three hours a week. The report suggested that the regulatory bodies should be able to back off on the tight restrictions they had placed on publishers like Tencent and NetEase over the prior few years. The NPPA issued new proposed rules in December 2023 aimed to further reduce the amount of time citizens play games and reduce in-game spending. These rules would prevent games from having daily or first-time login rewards and limit how much virtual currency that players could keep within in-game wallets. These rules appeared to be directly aimed at MMOs and gacha games, both popular titles within China, and as a result, both Tencent and NetEase saw major stock losses at the announcement of these rules totalling $80 billion. The government quickly walked back on these recommendations, and reported let go of the official that had drawn them by January 2024.  Online gaming Online gaming in China represents one of the largest and fastest growing Internet business sectors in the world. With 457 million Internet users currently active in China, the country now has the largest online user base in world, of which two-thirds engage in online game play. The average online gamer in China is relatively young (18 to 30 years old), male, and has at least completed a secondary level of education.  Demographically the online gaming user base in China is very similar to base of China Internet users, most of whom live in larger cities. Online games in China fall into two primary categories: MMORPGs and MOCGs. The former have a predilection for persistent online worlds where hundreds to thousands of game players can interact simultaneously; the latter is a generic term for games played competitively online without the existence of a persistent online realm (games as simple as online Ma Jiang and online competitive card games would fall under this category). In 2011, there were over 100 million Chinese MMO gamers. Official Chinese statistics regarding online gaming state that as of the close of 2006 revenue from China's online gaming industry reached RMB 8 billion or around US$1.04 billion, with earnings reaching around RMB 33 billion or US$4.3 billion. Additionally, while Japanese, American, and South Korean companies have traditionally dominated the market, Chinese developed software now holds a 65% market share on the mainland, with an additional 20 million in revenue generated by users outside of China. The online gaming market in China grew to $1.6 billion in 2007, and is expected to exceed $3 billion in 2010. According to another estimate, in 2007, China's online games market was worth about $970 million, with over 36 million gamers. China is now the world's largest online gaming market, contributing one third to the global revenue in this sector in 2009, or 56 percent of the Asia Pacific total. There are 368 million Internet users playing online games in the country and the industry was worth $13.5 billion in 2013. About 73% of gamers are male.  Games QQ Games is one such popular online client. Growth was driven in part by China's most popular online game, Netease's Fantasy Westward Journey, which now has 1.66 million peak concurrent users. Another contributor is Giant's '"Zhengtu Online, which has 1.52 million peak concurrent users.  The video game industry in China Publishers Today, the video game market is dominated by the Tencent Games division of Tencent Holdings, which is estimated to contribute to 46% of the overall revenue in China, and nearly 10% of the global video game market as of 2017, making it the largest video game company in the world. NetEase, which contributes to around 15% of overall revenue in China, is the second largest video game company in China, as well as the seventh largest in the world as of 2017. Other major players include Perfect World, Shunrong, and Shanda. These companies are noted for having made aggressive investments in foreign video game developers, particularly from South Korea and the United States, and for making strategic agreements with other entities to serve as the China-based operating arm for foreign interests to meet Chinese government regulations. Notably, Tencent's acquisitions have included: US$400 million to acquire Riot Games in 2011 to gain right to the online game League of Legends and US$8.6 billion for Supercell in 2016 for its mobile game Clash of Clans. Among major investments include approximately 5% of Activision in 2013, a 40% interest in Epic Games in 2013, and a 5% interest in Ubisoft in 2018. The 10 largest online game companies by revenue in 2017 are:  Tencent:  Tencent Games is the Interactive Entertainment Division (aka IED) of Tencent. NetEase: a popular online portal in China, also branched out in the space of MMORPGs with the release of Westward Journey. The game, based on ancient westward travels on the Silk Road (a popular theme from Chinese developed MMORPGs),  has gone through two iterations; it was re-released as Westward Journey II due to numerous problems with the initial release, and its game engine was used to develop Fantasy Westward Journey, which is currently the most popular MMORPG in China (based on PCU numbers). YY 37 Interactive Perfect World Elex IGG Alpha Group Century Huatong Group (owner of Shanda). Shanda produces and supports many popular MMORPGs. The company is significant because it introduced a new online payment system with the release of Legend of Mir 2 in 2001.  Instead of charging users for the initial purchase of the game, Shanda gave the software away free-of-charge and decided to charge users for time spent playing in game.  This payment system specifically counteracted piracy because the company could maintain easier control over the time users spent in the game, rather than attempt to limit the game's distribution. Shanda maintains a large number of MMORPGs in China developed by Western, Korean and native Chinese companies; the latter two regions produce Shanda's most popular games.  The company also maintains numerous casual games as well, with platforms supporting chess and other non-persistent world games. Kunlun Tech The9 (第九城市) is similar to Shanda Entertainment, it specifically maintains and produces MMORPG content for the Chinese gamer base.  The9 is notable because of its partnership with Blizzard Entertainment in bringing World of Warcraft (the most popular MMORPG outside of Asia) to China.  World of Warcraft is the most popular western MMORPG in Asia, and one of the most popular in China in general. Recent statistics place its peak concurrent users at around 688,000, easily among the top MMORPGs in the country.  The9 also implemented a pay-for-time system for the game, which differs from the monthly subscription payment structure used by Blizzard in other territories. In April 2009, World of Warcraft owner Activision Blizzard announced it had selected The9 competitor NetEase to operate the game in China. The9's license expired on June 7, 2009.  Popularity statistics In order to gauge the popularity of online games, both in China and internationally, three benchmarks are commonly implemented.  The first is peak concurrent users (PCU), which is the maximum numbers of players online simultaneously at a given time.  A high PCU number signifies that a game has a large base of constant user participation, which is essential for the survival of an online world.  The second statistic used is the daily active player base; this number is essentially a count of the number of disparate users who sign on in a given 24-hour period.  This statistic differs from PCU simply because of its longer time span but the daily user base is still a good quantifier of popularity and usage. The third statistic is simply the total number of registered users for a specific game or service, this statistic is significantly more problematic because most, if not all, online games do not limit the user to a single account or user name.  For example, some games claim millions of registered users; a disingenuous statistic given that the most popular MMORPGs in China usually garner only 800,000 to one million peak concurrent users.  Thus, while registered user numbers can be quite impressive, they are not as accurate a gauge of popularity as the other aforementioned statistics.  Investment In 2010, there were 25 investments made into Chinese online gaming companies.  Of the 25 investments 20 of these deal disclosed financial details. As a group these 20 deals combined for a total of US$137 million in investment.  Developers China has domestically produced a number of games, including Arena of Valor, Westward Journey,  The Incorruptible Warrior, and Crazy Mouse. There are a large number of domestically made massively multiplayer online role-playing game MMORPGs in China, although many generally remain unheard of outside of the country. China does have a small but growing indie game scene. The growth of China's indie game scene is considered to have been through hobbyist programmers starting around the 1990s and into the 2000s after the console ban where personal computer games became more popular. An early well-known indie developer, Coconut Island, was founded in the mid-2000s, and through its success, starting a number of game jams around the country starting in 2011, and eventually established the China Indie Game Alliance, one of the country's largest developer communities. Further interest in indie game development came with the popularity of mobile games in the country. The 2014 title Monument Valley developed by Ustwo in the United Kingdom is considered to have been an influential title as it was able to tell an emotional story through the game medium, and drew more interest in the indie game scene. Indie game development is challenged by the governmental approval process, requiring resources that many indie developers do not have. As with mainstream commercial games, indie games must be approved and get a license to be sold, or otherwise may be offered freely, which does not require a license. This has led to a black market around obtaining licenses, using non-China-controlled platforms like Steam to distribute games, or other questionable means to get their game into players' hands. As Valve has been working with Perfect World to create a China-specific client for Steam, which would be limited to games approached by the Chinese government, several indie developers fear this may harm the indie scene within China.  Manufacturers Most of the major video game systems in the world since the 1990s have been manufactured in China; by 2019, 96% of all video game consoles were manufactured in China, generally taking advantage of the net lower-income labor available in the country. Some of the larger manufacturers based in China or with factories within China creating video game consoles include Foxconn, Hosiden, and Flex. Because of this, trade relations between China and other countries can have an impact on video game console pricing. Around 2019, as Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo were preparing their next generation systems, a trade war between the United States and China was threatening to create a 25% import tariff on electronic goods shipped into the U.S. from China, which would have significantly affected the prices of these new consoles. There had already been an impact on personal computer components prior, leading to speculation on the impact on consoles. Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo jointly petitioned the U.S. government to not go through with this plan, in addition to other electronics vendors in the U.S. By January 2020, the U.S. government affirmed it had backed off this planned tariff. Despite this, Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo have all expressed plans to divest some of the Chinese manufacturing to other countries in southeast Asia such as Vietnam.  Esports Esports in China had been significant since 1996, as the country gained access to the Internet and PC gaming cafes began appearing across the county, also added by the popularity of QQ, a Chinese instant messaging client that helped with long-distance communications. Players quickly flocked to existing Western games that supported competitive Internet play such as Command & Conquer: Red Alert and Quake II. However, it was the release of StarCraft in 1998 that established the formation of organized competitive esports in China, including the formation of the China StarCraft Association to arrange unofficial tournaments for 1999 and onward. That same year was also the first official esports tournament in China based on Quake II. By 2000, the China E-Sports Association, formed from StarCraft players, was established, and Chinese players and teams participated and won medals starting with the World Cyber Games 2001. By 2003, the Chinese government recognized the success that Chinese players had in these games, and despite the stigma that the government had towards the addicting qualities of video games, recognized esports as an official sport in 2003, encouraging youth to excel in this area and that participating in esports was "training the body for China". China continued to expand its esports engagement alongside South Korea over the next several years, with its growth occurring alongside the growth of other online games in China. China became more involved with planning of the World Cyber Games along South Korea, who had founded the event in 2000. The growth was further fueled by China's large Internet companies investing in esports teams and players, establishing esport tournaments of their own, and acquiring Korea developers of popular esports games. These companies have also gained investment into foreign companies that have produced popular esports titles in China. Notably, Tencent initially acquired an investment into Riot Games in 2008, which produced League of Legends, and by 2015 had fully acquired the studio. Tencent has also invested into Activision Blizzard, which, through Blizzard Entertainment, distribute StarCraft, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Heroes of the Storm. The Alibaba Group and other e-commerce Chinese businesses have also invested heavily into the esports arena within China as early as 2006, but have made more inroads by establishing the World Electronic Sports Games in 2016 as a replacement for the World Cyber Games. Alibaba's efforts have centered on making the cities of Hangzhou and Changzhou esports centers in China. Due to both government encouragement and industry investment, the number of professional esports players in China grew from 50 in 2006 to over 1000 in 2016. In early 2019, China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security included both "professional gamer" and "professional gaming operator" as an officially recognized job on its Occupation Skill Testing Authority list; by July 2019, around 100,000 people had registers themselves as "professional gamers" under this, and were making an average of three times the average salary in China. The Ministry had stated they believe that the professional esports sector in China can have over 2 million jobs in five years. This expansive growth has led several local governments to offer incentives for bringing esports to their cities. In esports, China has been the world leader in terms of tournament winnings, possessing some of the best talents in the world across multiple video games, as well as one of the largest pool of video gamers. As of 2017, half of the top 20 highest earning esports players in the world are Chinese. In addition to talent, China is also one of the largest consumers of esports. The 2017 League of Legends World Championship, held in Beijing, drew an estimated 106 million viewers from online streaming services with 98% of them from China, a number on par with the television audience of the Super Bowl. The event was seen as China establishing its place in the global esports marketplace, and demonstrated how China and South Korea's leadership in this area has helped to expand esports popularity to other countries. China is estimated to have about 20% of the global revenue in esports, including sponsorships, merchandising and media rights, with an estimated US$210 million of the global US$1.1 billion by 2019, having surpassed Europe and trailing only behind North America. Despite the popularity of esports in the country, it is still not exempt from the grasp of the government's censorship. This was most notable in the Blitzchung controversy in October 2019 where an American video game developer Blizzard Entertainment punished Ng Wai Chung (吳偉聰) (known as Blitzchung), a Hong Kongese esports player of the online video game Hearthstone, for voicing his support of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests during an official streaming event. Despite the public's response, which included a boycott and a letter from United States Congress representatives, Blizzard did not remove the punishment but did slightly reduce it.  Intellectual property protection As described above, China has had a history of a gray market of illegal imports and video game clones, both in hardware and software, as well as copyright theft/piracy as a result of poor intellectual property laws and enforcement in the latter part of the 20th century. Chinese developers have been known to copy video games from foreign developers which resulted in multiple clones of established video game franchises.  Some developers take inspiration from existing games and incorporate the designs, gameplay and mechanics to their own IPs.  There have been multiple lawsuits filed by major video game companies such as the case filed by Riot Games against Moonton Technology for copying its characters featured in League of Legends. Riot itself has failed to have U.S. courts rule in their favor due to the copyright-taking happening outside of the United States, but through its partner Tencent, they have been successful in lawsuits filed in China. There have been reports where plagiarists are credited as the original creators.  Analysts have attributed the rise in plagiarism to lack of knowledge of the original IPs due to non-releases of games in the Chinese Markets, delays or outright ban by the Chinese government. More recently, with the tech industry boom in China, the government has implemented stricter copyright controls and processes, but it is still considered to be weaker than intellectual copyright protections in Western nations, which poses a threat for foreign companies seeking to sell into China. Because of the high amount of software piracy in China, many foreign game companies have been reluctant to enter the country's market with single player or console games. Instead, they have focused on selling online titles such as massively multiplayer online games as income from these titles comes largely from subscription fees or in game item purchases rather than the purchase price of the title itself. Nintendo claims that, as of February 14, 2008, China remains the main source of manufacturing pirated Nintendo DS and Wii games.  Farming As of December 2005, there were an estimated 100,000 Chinese employed as "farmers", video game players who work to acquire virtual currency or items in online games so they can be sold to other players for real currency.  Government oversight Responsible agencies Video games are regulated through the government and the Chinese Communist Party as with most mass media in China, but further, as video games are seen as a cultural benefit, additional agencies are involved in promoting the growth of video games.  Ministry of Information Industry The Ministry of Information Industry (MII) of the People's Republic of China (中华人民共和国工业和信息化部) was formed in the late 1990s through the integration of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and the Ministry of Electronics Industry. The agency's primary goals include the regulation and promotion of Chinese telecommunications and software companies which include online gaming. MII is also responsible for a number of initiatives aimed at increasing the number and prominence of natively produced online games. One example of such involvement is the inclusion of online gaming in the 2006–2010 plan for software and information service development. Listed here are the ministry's stated objectives involving online gaming:  Study and formulate the state's information industry development strategies, general and specific policies, and overall plans, revitalize the electronics and information products manufacturing, telecommunications and software industries, promote the information economy and society. Draw up laws, rules and regulations on electronics and information products manufacturing, telecommunications and software industries, and publish administrative rules and regulations; and supervise the enforcement of laws and administrative rules. Work out technical policies, systems and criteria of the electronics and information products manufacturing, telecommunications and software industries, and technical systems and criteria of the radio and television transmission networks; certificate the entry of telecom networking equipment to networks and manage the entry of telecom terminal equipment to networks; direct the supervision and management of electronics and information products quality. Propel the research and development of electronics and information products manufacturing, telecommunications and software industries, organize research of major scientific and technological development projects, and digestion, absorption and creation of imported technologies, and promote the industrialization of scientific and technological research results; support the development of native industry. The ministry is also responsible for a number of initiatives aimed at increasing the number and prominence of natively produced online games. One example of such involvement is the inclusion of online gaming in the 2006–2010 plan for software and information service development.  General Administration of Press and Publication The General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP) (中华人民共和国新闻出版总暑) is responsible for monitoring and regulating publication of print based media, electronic media, and audio-visual products (including online games). GAPP has also been instrumental in combating the growing problem of Internet addiction and game addiction in China by teaming up with eight other government outlets concerned with the growing effect of game play on China's youth. Towards this end, GAPP works with other agencies, including the Central Civilization Office, Ministry of Education, Chinese Communist Youth League, Ministry of Information Industry, Ministry of Public Security, All China Women's Federation, and China's Care for the Next Generation Work Commission.  GAPP also initiated the China National Online Game Publication Project in 2004. The intent of the project was to promote native game development through the use of government subsidies to game developers. In its third year, the project is to run through at least 2008, and has provided an estimated 300 million RMB to 16 Chinese game development companies.  State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television China's State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT; 国家广播电影电视总局) affected the world of Chinese online games in 2004 by instating a blanket ban on computer game related commercials in the state-run media.  The only company to directly contradict this ban is Chinese game provider The9, which teamed with Coca-Cola to jointly promote the release of the popular Western MMORPG World of Warcraft in 2005.  Besides this instance, the online game market has thrived without much media promotion.  Crime The Beijing Reformatory for Juvenile Delinquents claimed in 2007 that a third of its detainees were influenced by violent online games or erotic websites when committing crimes such as robbery and rape. In a high-profile case from October 2004, 41-year-old Qiu Chengwei was sentenced to death for murdering 26-year-old Zhu Caoyuan over a dispute regarding the sale of a virtual weapon the two had jointly won in the game Legend of Mir 3. Also, in September 2007, a Chinese man in Guangzhou died after playing Internet video games for three consecutive days in an Internet cafe.  Content control and censorship As with almost all mass media in the country, video games in China are subject to the national policies of censorship. Content in video games is overseen by SART/NRTA; publishers are required to obtain a license for the game in China from SART before publishing, which may be denied if the game contains elements deemed inappropriate. The process to submit games for a license and put them on sale following that is overseen by MOC. The State General Administration of Press and Publication and anti-porn and illegal publication offices have also played a role in screening games. Examples of banned games have included:  Hearts of Iron (for "distorting history and damaging China's sovereignty and territorial integrity") I.G.I.-2: Covert Strike (for "intentionally blackening China and the Chinese army's image") Command & Conquer: Generals (for "smearing the image of China and the Chinese army") Battlefield 4 (for "smearing the image of China and endangering national security") In addition to banning games completely, several games have had their content screened to remove certain imagery deemed offensive or unfavorable. Common examples include skeletons or skulls being either fleshed out or removed entirely. Cases of which can be seen in Chinese versions of popular video games such as Dota 2 and World of Warcraft. With the formation of the Online Game Ethics Committee in December 2018, nine titles reportedly were classified as prohibited or to be withdrawn, but this has yet to be confirmed by reliable sources. These included Fortnite, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, H1Z1, Paladins, and Ring of Elysium. Eleven other titles were told that they needed to make corrective action to be sold within China, including Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Diablo 3, and League of Legends. Publishing a title without having government approval can lead to a company being fined from five to ten times the revenues they earned from the game. In addition to content control, the Chinese government has pushed technology companies, including video game distributors like Tencent, into allowing the government to have partial ownership of the companies that can be used to affect the content produced; in exchange, such companies may gain a competitive edge over others in interactions dealing with the government. Along with guidelines to control and eliminate youth gaming issued in September 2021, the Chinese government has also issued a guidelines regarding the presentation of LGBT and "effimininacy" in video games are to be avoided.  Anti-addiction measures China was one of the first countries to recognize the potential for addiction to the Internet, video games, and other digital media, and was the first country to formally classify Internet addiction a clinical disorder by recognizing Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Internet Addiction in 2008. In 2015, the Chinese government also found that more than 500 million citizens over five years old, nearly half the population, suffered from some form of near-sightednessed, and while video games were not solely responsible for this, the government felt they needed to reduce the amount of time youth played video games. China has sought to deal with addiction to video games by its youth by enacting regulations to be implemented by video game publishers aimed to limit consecutive play time particularly for children. As early as 2005 China's Ministry of Culture has enacted several public health efforts to address gaming and internet related disorders. One of the first systems required by the government was launched in 2005 to regulate adolescents' Internet use, including limiting daily gaming time to 3 hours and requiring users' identification in online video games. In 2007, an "Online Game Anti-Addiction System" was implemented for minors, restricting their use to 3 hours or less per day. The ministry also proposed a "Comprehensive Prevention Program Plan for Minors’ Online Gaming Addiction" in 2013, to promulgate research, particularly on diagnostic methods and interventions. China's Ministry of Education in 2018 announced that new regulations would be introduced to further limit the amount of time spent by minors in online games. While these regulations were not immediately binding, most large Chinese publishers took steps to implement the required features. For example, Tencent restricted the amount of time that children could spend playing one of its online games, to one hour per day for children 12 and under, and two hours per day for children aged 13-18. This is facilitated by tracking players via their state-issued identification numbers. This has put some pressure on Western companies that publish via partners in China on how to apply these new anti-addiction requirements into their games, as outside of China, tracking younger players frequently raises privacy concerns. Specialized versions of games, developed by the Chinese partner, have been made to meet these requirements without affecting the rest of the world; Riot Games let its China-based studio implement the requirements into League of Legends for specialized release in China. A new law enacted in November 2019 limits children under 18 to less than 90 minutes of playing video games on weekdays and three hours on weekends, with no video game playing allowed between 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. These are set by requiring game publishers to enforce these limits based on user logins. Additionally, the law limits how much any player can spend on microtransactions, ranging from about $28 to $57 per month depending on the age of the player. In September 2020, the government implemented its own name-based authentication system to be made available to all companies to uphold these laws. Chinese regulators further reduced the amount of time minors are allowed to play online games in August 2021 to one hour each day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, as well as on public holidays, from 8 to 9 pm. The measures also capped how much minors could spend on such games, with those between 8 and 16 limited to 200 yuan per month, and those between 16 and 18 to 400 yuan per month. Implementation measures were not described as part of this regulation. In September 2021, GAPP launched a website that allowed for any Chinese citizen to report on games that appeared to be in violation of these anti-addiction measures, classified between those that failed to perform proper identity checks, those that failed limit minors' hours, and those that failed to limit minors' spending within the game.  Data privacy Most of the large publishers in China routinely collect data on players and how they play their game. One primary reason is that this is information that may be mandated by the government due to its mass surveillance programs and for implementing systems such as for the anti-addiction measures. Secondly, many of these large companies not only provide video games but a range of media across the spectrum including online video, music, and books, and these companies couple that data to have better reach of targeted advertising as to increase revenues. There are fears, but no reported cases, of these large companies sharing data with the government from foreign users. These fears have had impacts for companies that are fully or partially controlled by Chinese companies. For example, Epic Games in 2018 released its own digital storefront, the Epic Games Store which came under some criticism by players in the West, partially due to fear that Epic would share their data with Tencent and subsequently to the Chinese government, and have called the Store spyware.  Foreign ownership With the rising success of online games from 2007 onwards, some foreign companies sought to invest full or partial ownership of Chinese companies to help capture a portion of the growing market. The Chinese government, concerned that these foreign companies would have influence on how the Chinese companies manage their video games, passed a law that banned any foreign company from investing or having any type of ownership in a Chinese company, with the General Administration of Press and Publication serving as the watchdog for such violations. This still allows for foreign companies to bring games into China, but only through operating agreements and partnerships with wholly owned Chinese companies. For example, Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft, an extremely popular MMO in China, was run initially through The9 and later by NetEase, both companies making necessary changes to parts of the game to adhere to Chinese content regulations.  Content ratings China introduced a pilot version of its first content rating system in December 2020, the "Online Game Age-Appropriateness Warning" system. It uses three color-based classifications, green for "8+" (games appropriate for ages 8 and up), blue for "12+", and yellow for "16+". Games with online components are required to display these labels on packaging, their website, registration pages, and other relevant materials, The rating system was developed by the Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association alongside Tencent and NetEase and 52 other organizations.

Klana (Italian: Clana) is a municipality in Primorje-Gorski Kotar County in northwestern Croatia.  Geography The municipal area is situated in the densely forested Gorski kotar mountains, about 18 km (11 mi) north of Rijeka and the Kvarner Gulf, close to the border with Slovenia. At Klana is the source of the Reka river, running northwards across the border towards the Slovenian Snežnik karst plateau. Though officially part of Primorje-Gorski Kotar County, the area marks the northeastern rim of the Istrian historical region, bordering Croatia proper in the east as well as Slovene Istria and Inner Carniola in the north. There are 1,975 inhabitants, in the following settlements:  Breza, population 60 Klana, population 1,203 Lisac, population 114 Studena, population 382 Škalnica, population 216 As of 2011, the population is 94% Croats.  History The name Klana was first mentioned in a 1235 deed (located in the Roman library) recording a visit of the Bishop of Pula. Due to its geographical position at a crossroads from north to south and from east to west, as well as its forests rich in wildlife and fresh water springs, the area was suitable for settlement even in ancient times. Indications of Histri settlements trace back to around the 6th or 5th century BC.  Croatians settled in the eastern and central Istrian peninsula, as well as in the area around Klana, from the 7th century onwards and early on accepted Christianity. Mass was conducted in the Old Church Slavonic language and writing was done in Glagolitic, with evidence in the Vatican archives of mass in Old Slavonic taking place in the 13th century in the Holy Trinity Church of the castle overlooking the town. Additional evidence of Glagolitic writing is in the form of an inscription from 1439 AD placed over the door to the sacristy of the parish church of St. Jerome. The scholar Johann Weikhard von Valvasor (1641–1693) wrote of the celebration of mass in Old Slavonic in the 17th century. In 1040 Emperor Henry III had established the March of Istria; from the 12th century onwards Klana was a possession of the Counts of Castel Duino, officials of the Counts of Gorizia at nearby Kastav. In 1374 northeastern Istria finally passed to the Austrian House of Habsburg, while the western and southern parts of the peninsula were gradually conquered by the Republic of Venice. From about 1400 the Klana estates were held by the Lords of Walsee. Throughout the Middle Ages, Klana was an important trading center and incorporated turnpike with postal service coordinated between the Imperial Duchy of Carniola in the north and the Adriatic Port of Rijeka. In Early Modern times, Klana and the whole Habsburg monarchy were constantly threatened by the Ottoman Turks who repeatedly raided the region. However, on 2 February 1559, the Ottomans under the leadership of Malkoč-beg experienced a heavy defeat by Uskok forces under Ivan Lenković at the Battle of Klana. From the 15th century until 1918, with a short-lived discontinuation within the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy and the Illyrian Provinces from 1805 to 1815, power was stabilized under the Austrian Habsburgs, who gave rule over Klana as a gift to various Lords. In 1849 it was incorporated into the Austrian Littoral crown land. In 1843, Klana began operating a public school and the first known teacher was Joseph Corsiga. After the abolition of serfdom upon the 1848 revolution, the people of Klana purchased from Baron Andrije Negovetić his portion of land in 1861, including the right (which expired at the beginning of the 20th century) to elect a mayor. 1852 saw the birth of Matko Laginja, a national revivalist of Istria and in 1920 Ban of Croatia, the most notable native of the region. Klana was hit by a devastating earthquake in 1870 that destroyed most of the houses, but fortunately there were no casualties. In that same year, a post office was established and in 1882 gas lamps were introduced. At the beginning of the 20th century, Klana, despite the loss of importance gained in the past century, was still developing. Thus, in 1908, the post office received a telegraph station, 1911 saw the merchant Anton Medvedić establish a sawmill, and in 1913 Klana received its first aqueduct. Also at that time a reading room, library and tamburitza club were established. During World War I, the people of Klana, like their neighbors, fought on battlefields across Europe. With the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Klana became part of the unrecognized State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, but almost simultaneously it was occupied by Italian forces along with the surrounding villages. The Treaty of Rapallo two years later drew the border between Klana and Studena so that Studena remained a part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia) while Klana, Škalnica, Lisac and Breza were annexed into the Julian March of Italy. Klana soon became one of the largest border garrisons of the Italian kingdom, where there were stationed up to 10,000 Italian soldiers. Despite the high concentration of troops and attempt at Italianization, which almost immediately began and culminated in various fascist repressions and the introduction of Italian in school and other institutions, people living in Klana still preserved their Croatian identity. One of the most stalwart guardians of Croatian was Pastor Ivan Koruza, who was in Klana from 1896 to 1942. In the mid 1930s, many Klana residents were forcibly mobilized and sent to the battlefields of the Italo-Abyssinian War in Ethiopia. Following Italy's capitulation in World War II and the decision of ZAVNOH (State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia) in 1943, Klana with Istria joined the Socialist Republic of Croatia, though two difficult years of war lay ahead. Nazi German forces occupied the region in 1944 and reinforced the Rapallo border such that in April and May 1945, fierce fighting took place. Klana was finally liberated on 5 May 1945. After World War Two, Klana was an independent municipality from 1945 to 1953 and then a local community within the framework of the former Municipality of Rijeka. In Klana there is a sawmill and forestry service, a newly built school, firestation, community hall, restored churches and despite depopulation, is an area of urbanization. In the Croatian War of Independence, fought from 1991 to 1995, many people from the area participated in the defense of the country. In 1993 in the new democratic country of Croatia, Klana again became a municipality united with Studena, Škalnica, Lisac and Breza, thus establishing the conditions for community development through a localized government.  Gradina Castle The archeological site of Gradina Castle  (Kaštel Gradina or "Gradina") is located on the top of a rocky hill just above the town center. The highest point of the building is located at 629 m above sea level. The strategic position was first used during late antiquity in the 3rd century AD during the time of the construction of a system of surveillance stations, fortifications, and ramparts known as the "Liburnian Limes". Since the limes pass by the town of Studena, this overlook is already located within the Roman Empire, which means that the town was also under Roman rule. After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, oversight of the town changed quickly.  In the 10th century, Klana belonged to the Croatian state as evidenced by the nearby town of Permani, named after the Croatian border guards. Around 1118, Croatia lost the area from the town of Mune to Klana, which was conquered by the Germans, so that now a new border ran along the river Rječina and the defense of Croatia is taken over by the people of Grobnica and their guards, the "Permani". In 1351, Rudolf Devinski (a Count of Devin, named after Duino Castle near Trieste) recognized the Counts of Goričko as his seniors; however, as early as 1366, he was forced to recognize the Habsburgs as his masters. In 1399, the Devin family died out, and their estates were taken over by the Counts of Walsee of Habsburg lineage and were allowed to use the Devin coat of arms. The Walsee family began upgrading and enlarging the living space and the former guard space slowly grew into a less robust fort. Over time, the quality of housing gradually improves, as evidenced by the use of stoves of various qualities. In the immediate vicinity was built the chapel of the Holy Trinity, from which originated a fragment of the Glagolitic inscription dated to 1439, which is currently built into the facade of the parish church of St. Hieronymus.  The expansion of the premises and the construction of the chapel prove that a representative of the Gothic Captaincy was already staying in Klana at that time, which can already be considered the core of the future Klan lordship. The Walsee family held this area until 1466, when the last offspring of the Walsee lineage, Wolfgang, died, and the Klan lordship passed into the hands of the Habsburgs on the basis of his will. In 1468, Emperor Frederick III of the Habsburgs leased fortified barracks in Klana and Rijeka to a Mr. Barbo for two years for 1,400 crowns a year. How the Barbo family comes into possession of the entire estate and Klana is unknown. Gradina Castle was expanded to include a larger open area for the reception of population and livestock within the walls. In the sixteenth century, Europe was seriously threatened by Ottoman invasion. The army and local authorities organized a system of couriers for the urgent transmission of news along the border. An alert system was developed through a combination of bonfires, horn/bell signals, and courier services. Gradina Castle always had two horsemen ready to report danger to Ljubljana and Trieste on light, karst horses so that at the first observation of approaching enemy armies, the so-called "Turkish Letters" from Klana would be immediately sent by couriers, footmen, or horsemen depending on the urgency of the situation.In January 1559, the Ottoman army led by Malkoč-Beg (known as one of the most belligerent Turkish warlords) approached the fortified Gradina Castle where the well-known Turkish ferocity was broken and the army repelled. One month after that, on February 2, the Turks came back with greater ferocity and anger, imbued with a desire for revenge, but this time they were repulsed and left behind many fallen comrades on the battlefield. Residents then chopped up the bodies of the slain Turks and fed them to their dogs, according to a report by Martin Bautcher. The Turks instilled such anger and hatred that the inhabitants considered the slain bodies unworthy of burial. As the castle was damaged and became unsuitable for housing, the Barbo family built a new, smaller two-story classic castle that was below the original and closer to Klana itself (the current location of the Forestry Service Offices) and likely burned down in the early 18th century, so the other owners and everyone else stopped living in Klana, which had a negative impact on the development of the town and surrounding area.   At the beginning of the 17th century, the threat of Turkish invasion ceased. In the first third of the 17th century, Baroness Elizabetta Barbo, the daughter of Ludovica Ambrosi Barbo married Baron Carlo Panizzoli with a dowry that included Klana and the castle. Due to the Austro-Venetian war and most likely at the request of the Imperial Chamber, new corner towers were built such that the old round towers were partly rebuilt and partly demolished, after which new ones were built with a much thicker trapezoidal floor plan. The castle now has the shape of an elongated irregular rectangle which follows the natural strata of the rocky elevation. The maximum length of the fortress is 75 m and the width varies from 20 to 25 m. Their daughter Ana Maria marries the knight Oraz Scampicchi, who after her death sells Klana to Baron Wolfgang Oberburg. In the first half of the 18th century, the Barons Lazzarini came into possession of the lordship of Klana and ruled it for almost a century though their residence is in nearby Guteneg. After the Lazzarinis, the Barons Negovetić became owners of Klana. Andrija Negovetić, Josip's son whose name is inscribed on the plaque above the entrance to the parish church of St. Hieronymus, on December 29, 1860, sold the lordship of Klana to the inhabitants along with all the remaining estate and forests. After the conclusion of the "Madrid" peace, the castle lost its significance and was gradually abandoned, so that in the 19th century almost completely disappeared in the catastrophic earthquake that struck the area of  Klana on March 1, 1870, after which all the quality stone was removed from the castle due to the reconstruction of the settlement at the foot of the castle. In the early 1990s, under the supervision of the Conservation Department of the State Institution for the Protection of Memorial Heritage, under the expert guidance of archaeologists, and at the initiative of the Historical Society of Klana, systematic archaeological conservation work began at Gradina Castle. With the help of the Municipality of Klana, Primorje-Gorski Kotar County, and partly the Republic of Croatia at the beginning of the 21st century, all the necessary funds were provided for this long-term work, which has come to an end thanks to a significant amount of European funds that helped to create an access road to the castle allowing for use in tourism and other events.  Catholic Churches and Chapels Saint Jerome Church St. Jerome's Church (St. Hieronymus; Klana dialect: Sveti Jerolim) is the main parish church for the municipality of Klana. Few written records about the history of the church survive as they were destroyed in the parish archives during World War II when the parish office and the priest's house were destroyed during aerial bombing. In 1679, Johann Weikhard Valvasor made a graphic representation of Klana with the church of St. Hieronymus suggesting that the church existed as early as the 17th century. Construction was completed in 1836 and the church was consecrated in 1850 by Bishop Bartholomew Legat. Above the main entrance there is a built-in stone slab with a Latin inscription which says that the church was completed at a time when the largest landowner in Klana was Josip Negovetić (landowner), pastor Klement Marotti, and church elders Grgur Gauš and Luka Laginja. In 1870, a devastating earthquake struck Klana, the vault of the church was damaged, the steps to the main altar, and the altar itself. The church was thoroughly repaired, but underwent major alterations throughout the twentieth century. The most valuable artifact found in the church is a fragment of a Glagolitic stone slab from 1439. On that fragment it is written, "1439 it is written" and it is built into the face of the church above the main entrance. This is evidence of the use of the Glagolitic alphabet in this area and is unique in that its letters are raised instead of carved out. Inside the church can be found a marble altar of the Virgin of the Seven Sorrows, located in a semicircular apse (late 18th century). On the main altar on either side are sculptures of light marble: the left represents St. Florian and the right St. Rocco. There is also a baptistery from the 18th century, decorated with a shallow relief of ivy or plant-like forms, which is built into the wall to the left of the altar. On November 5, 1906 the Administrative Council of the Municipality of Klana ordered a new organ from the Zupan Brothers factory in Kamova Gorica, which was then assembled and put into use in 1907. In 1916, during World War I, Austrian authorities removed all three bells and melted them down to make cannons. The church was without bells until 1922, when the pastor procured three new bells from Udine, Italy. 12 kg of silver was used to cast the large bell along with the bronze, but in 1942, two of these three bells experience the same fate as the ones they replaced: they were taken down and melted by the Italian military. In the 1960s and 1970s, the roof and interior of the church were thoroughly renovated and according to plans from the beginning of the 20th century, the tower was reconstructed (1994), new bells were installed (1995) along with a new organ. In 2001, the benches and choir were renovated, which is where the church's appearance remains today.  Saint Rocco Church St. Rocco's Church was mentioned as early as the 17th century by Valvasor as a chapel of ease of the parish church of St. Jerome. It is not known when this church was built, but it was almost certainly built before 1630. It is located at the entrance to the main village next to the road, typical of the churches built in honor of St. Rocco. Today's church was built on the site of the old one in 1861. The central position in the church is occupied by an altar formed from the image of St. Rocco lined with marble. St. Rocco shown in the image has all the iconographic elements that can be attributed to it: a Jesuit bearded face and long hair, a low-cut modest habit with tucked shells, Jacob's cap - a symbol of pilgrimage to the Spanish Saint James Compostello (St. Rocco was never there, but helped and protected pilgrims.) His left hand rests on a pilgrim's stick on which a gourd of water is hung, and on his right thigh, the saint points to a newly healed wound that symbolizes a plague.   Legend says that St. Rocco's picture came out in front of the plague and stopped it with the words: “I'm mowing here, not you!” The plague was stopped and proceeded to affect Skalnica, sparing the town of Klana. Since then, the 'Rokova' Festival has been celebrated in Klana by holding a fair and dance and is a large multi-day festival.  Saint Michael's Church The St. Michael's Church (Sveti Mihovil) was built at the end of the 9th and beginning of the 10th century. It is located in Klana's cemetery and unlike St. Hieronymus's Church, it has always had the appearance it has today. The church has a small tower with a bell and inside there is an altar with St. Michael. It was renovated at the beginning of the 19th century and in 1953 the roof was repaired by the conservation institute, under whose protection the church is still today. During reconstruction of the ground floor in 2004 under the leadership of Mrs. Mie Rizner from the Conservation Department of the Directorate for the Protection of Cultural Heritage, archaeological excavations were carried out in the church during which the tombs of the Barbo and Panizzoli families were found, historical Lords and owners of Klana. It was at last established that Ana Maria Panizzoli (nee Barbo) is buried there. At one time, the church of St. Michael was a parish church but today serves as the church for Masses for the dead during funerals and on All Saints' Day.  Chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes The Chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes (Kapelica Majke Božje Lurdske, Klana dialect: Majka Božja na Strmašćici) was built in 1904 and according to tradition, it was built on the site where Our Lady appeared to Martin Šustar in 1903. This happened in the early morning darkness, while Martin was driving an oxcart to Rijeka for firewood. When he reached the place where the chapel stands today (Strmašćica), he was blinded by a terrible light, above which the Mother of God hovered. She told him to build a chapel in that place, because it is alone on the old road, and she will in turn preserve the place. Martin fainted and the oxen brought him home on their own. The next day he told all this to the parish priest Fr. Koruza, who with the whole town, had a chapel built on the location of the vision. A few years ago the chapel was restored because a candle caused a fire that damaged it and in 2004 the environment was completely redecorated after a strong wind storm knocked over the tall pines that grew there. It is a true miracle that the chapel remained undamaged. In 2008, the late Josip Barak (Jožić Mavšin) completely restored the statue of Our Lady. Every day in front of the chapel one can see people who have come to pray, light a candle or simply pray in peace. Some time ago even a wedding was held there. Every year on August 15, on the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a procession starts from St. Hieronymus's Church in Klana to the chapel at Strmašćica with singing and praying of the rosary, after which a mass is celebrated on the grounds of the chapel.

The Leuven Vulgate or Hentenian Bible (French: Louvain Vulgate, Latin: Biblia Vulgata lovaniensis) was the first standardized edition of the Latin Vulgate. The Leuven Vulgate essentially served as the standard text of the Catholic Church from its publication in 1547 until the Sixtine Vulgate was published in 1590. The 1583 edition of the Leuven Vulgate is cited in the Oxford Vulgate New Testament, where it is designated by the siglum H (H for Hentenian). In 1546, partly in response to the Protestant Reformation, the Council of Trent declared the Vulgate the official Bible of the Catholic church. However, there were different versions of the Vulgate in use, and no one edition was accepted as standard. In response, Biblical scholar John Henten sought to produce a more reliable edition by comparing thirty different manuscripts of the Vulgate and drawing from the work of earlier scholars, such as Robert Estienne. This standardized Vulgate was edited by Hentenius (1499–1566) and published in 1547 in Leuven, Belgium, hence the name "Leuven Vulgate". This edition was republished several times, and in 1574, a revised edition was published.  History Publications On 8 April 1546, at the Council of Trent, a decision was made to prepare an authorized version of the Vulgate. No direct action was taken for the next forty years, and many scholars continued to publish their own editions. Among these editions, the edition prepared by Hentenius served almost as the standard text of the Catholic Church. The first edition of Hentenius was entitled Biblia ad vetustissima exemplaria nunc recens castigata and was published by the printer Bartholomaeus Gravius in November 1547. Hentenius used over thirty Vulgate manuscripts to make his edition. Hentenius' edition is similar to the 1532 and 1540 editions of the Vulgate produced by Robert Estienne.  Lucas Brugensis editions After the death of Hentenius in 1566, Franciscus Lucas Brugensis continued his critical work and prepared his own edition; the edition was published in 1574 in Antwerp by Plantin, under the title: Biblia Sacra: Qui in hac editione, a Theologis Lovanienibus prestitum sit, paulo post indicatur. This revision has the same text as the original edition. However the punctuation was modified, and supplementary variants were added in the margin; few variants from the original edition were removed. In 1583, a new edition of the Leuven Vulgate was published by the Plantin Press. This edition was a reprint of the 1574 edition with as a supplement in appendix a critical apparatus made by Lucas Brugensis: his Notationes in sacra Biblia previously published independently in 1580. This edition was published under the title: Biblia Sacra, quid in hac editione a theologis Lovaniensibus praestitum sit, eorum praefatio indicat.  Importance The 1583 edition of the Leuven Vulgate served as the basis for the elaboration of the Sixtine and Clementine editions of the Vulgate. Using the Leuven Vulgate as basis, Nicolaus van Winghe translated the Bible into Dutch (1548), and Nicolas de Leuze translated the Bible into French (1550). Both translations were published in Leuven. Jakub Wujek based his translation, the Wujek Bible, on the 1574 edition of the Leuven Vulgate. Because the Douay-Rheims Bible was translated in 1582, it is a virtual certainty that the Leuven Vulgate, presumably the 1574 revision, was the translation basis for the Douay-Rheims Bible.

The CZW Iron Man Championship was a professional wrestling championship owned by the Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) promotion. The championship was created and debuted on February 13, 1999, at CZW's Opening Night event. The title is currently inactive, having been deactivated on July 11, 2009. Prior to its retirement, Sami Callihan renamed the title the CZW New Horror Championship, which CZW recognized. Being a professional wrestling championship, the title is won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. Overall, there were 37 reigns shared among 24 wrestlers, with two vacancies. All title changes occurred at CZW-promoted events. The inaugural champion was Derek Domino, who was recognized as champion on February 13, 1999, at CZW's Opening Night event by CZW. Wifebeater holds the record of most reigns, with four. At 364 days, Kevin Steen's only reign is the longest in the title's history. Lobo, with a combined three reigns, holds the record for most days as champion at 392. Domino's only and Wifebeater's second reign share the record for shortest reign at less than one day. Egotistico Fantastico was the final champion in his only reign before the title's deactivation.  History Upon the title's creation, CZW recognized Derek Domino as the first CZW Iron Man Champion on February 13, 1999 at their Opening Night event. Domino immediately had to defend the title that night against Lobo, who went on to win the match and the championship. On June 10, 2000 at CZW's Caged To The End event, Mad Man Pondo defeated Wifebeater to win the championship. However, on July 22, 2000 at CZW's No Rules, No Limits event, Wifebeater was awarded the championship without facing Pondo in a match for unknown reasons. Instead, that night Wifebeater defended the title against Nick Gage, who went on to win the title. During Lobo's third reign CZW held their Breakaway Brawl show on June 9, 2001. A Triple Threat Deathmatch for the CZW Iron Man Championship occurred involving Nick Mondo, Wifebeater, and Mad Man Pondo, which Mondo won to become champion. Lobo was not involved due to a broken leg injury he sustained from the night before. At CZW's High Stakes on May 11, 2002, CZW held a Four Way match for the CZW World Heavyweight and CZW Iron Man Championships, in which then-CZW World Heavyweight Champion Justice Pain and then-Iron Man Champion Adam Flash defended against The Messiah and Mondo. If a champion was pinned by another competitor, then they lost their championship in the encounter. Mondo ended up pinning Flash to win the Iron Man Championship in the bout. On July 13, 2002 at CZW's Deja Vu, Flash and Pain fought to a double pinfall for the CZW Iron Man and World Heavyweight Championships, which Pain held. Due to the double pinfall, Flash won the Iron Man Championship, while Pain retained the World Heavyweight Championship. On August 13, 2005 at CZW's Deja Vu 3, Kevin Steen defeated Franky The Mobster to begin the longest reign in the title's history. At 364 days, Steen's reign came to an end when he was pinned by LuFisto at CZW's Trapped, who became the first woman to win the title. At CZW's X: Decade of Destruction – 10th Anniversary event on February 14, 2009, Sami Callihan defeated Brain Damage to win the title. Later during his reign, Callihan renamed the title the CZW New Horror Championship. The title was vacated twice during its history before being retired in July 2009. The first vacancy occurred July 26, 2003 due to then-champion Mondo sustaining an injury. LuFisto was forced to vacate on January 13, 2007 when she also sustained an injury. Egotistico Fantastico was the last champion, by defeating Callihan on June 13, 2009 at CZW's Best Of The Best 9 gathering before the title was deactivated on July 11, 2009.

Jacques-Elie-Abraham Hermanjat (29 September 1862, Geneva - 12 October 1932, Aubonne) was a Swiss painter who worked primarily in the Fauvist and Divisionist styles and was one of the first Swiss artists to draw on the work of Paul Cézanne. He was also involved in cultural politics.  Biography After attending the public schools of Geneva, he studied art with Barthélemy Menn and Auguste Baud-Bovy. In 1886, he went to Algiers, to join his mother and brother after his father's death. He stayed until 1888 and returned on two other occasions; 1889-1890 and 1893-1896. During these visits, he developed an interest in Orientalism, a genre which was already in favor with some of his compatriots, including Charles Gleyre and Auguste Veillon. His paintings there were executed in the traditional styles he had learned in Geneva. In 1896 Hermanjat, then married, returned with his wife Marie Louise, née Zénobel (1855–1955), to Switzerland and initially settled in Lausanne. In 1908, they moved to Aubonne. By 1911, he had built a cottage there, where he lived until his death. He soon abandoned Orientalism and turned to landscapes, spending much of his time in the mountains; primarily near Aigle, although he also visited Valais, Nendaz, Haute-Nendaz and Verbier. His paintings from this period owe much to the influence of Giovanni Segantini.  During the years 1908 to 1912, he became attracted to Fauvism and began applying non-natural colors to his landscapes. In 1910, following genealogical research, he began spelling his name "Hermanjat", rather than "Hermenjat" as he had previously. It was also at this time that he made the acquaintance of Ferdinand Hodler and was influenced by Symbolism. Over the next decade, however, Cézanne would supplant Hodler as his primary inspiration. From 1910 to 1928, he was a member of the Central Committee of the Society of Swiss Painters, Sculptors and Architects (SPSAS). He also served on the Federal Commission for Fine Arts from 1922 to 1925. This was in addition to several teaching positions and jury service for art competitions. His adopted daughter, Germaine Hermanjat (1909-2002), started out to be a painter but devoted herself to the promotion of his works. In 2003, following her death, money she had bequeathed to the city of Nyon was used to create the Abraham Hermanjat Foundation. In 2012, the Musée historique et des porcelaines de Nyon, the Musée du Léman and the foundation joined, on the occasion of his 150th anniversary, to present the first major showing of his works in over thirty years.

The Trombone Concerto is a composition for trombone and orchestra written by the Scottish composer James MacMillan. The work was commissioned by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra for their principal trombonist Jörgen van Rijen and co-commissioned by a consortium of orchestras comprising the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, Royal Flemish Philharmonic Orchestra, the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, the Oulu Symphony Orchestra, and the Philharmonisches Orchester des Staatstheaters Cottbus. It was first performed by Jörgen van Rijen and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra under the direction of Iván Fischer at the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam, on 20 April 2017. The piece is dedicated to Jörgen van Rijen and in memory of Sara Maria MacMillan, the composer's granddaughter, who died shortly before its composition.  Composition The music is cast in one continuous movement and has a duration of roughly 30 minutes in performance.  Instrumentation The work is scored for a solo trombone and a large orchestra consisting of three flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, two additional trombones, bass trombone, tuba, timpani, two percussionists, harp, piano, and strings.  Reception The Trombone Concerto has been well received by music critics. Reviewing the United States premiere in Dallas, Scott Cantrell of The Dallas Morning News wrote, "Twenty-nine minutes long, in multiple contrasting sections played without pause, it definitely exploits the trombone's wide-ranging possibilities and a vast array of orchestral textures." Wayne Lee Gay of the Texas Classical Review called it "a grandly ambitious and assertive work, cast in a single, continuous and eventful rhapsodic movement." Reviewing a performance by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, Ken Walton of The Scotsman similarly described the piece as "[a] heartrending work, no holds barred."

The Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial is a memorial dedicated in 1994 recognizing the dead of the Port Chicago disaster, and the critical role played by Port Chicago, California during World War II, in serving as the main facility for the Pacific Theater of Operations. The national memorial is located at the Concord Naval Weapons Station near Concord, California, in the United States. The 1944 Port Chicago disaster occurred at the naval magazine and resulted in the largest domestic loss of life during World War II. A total of 320 sailors and civilians were instantly killed on July 17, 1944, when the ships they were loading with ammunition and bombs exploded. The majority of the deaths were African American sailors working for the racially segregated military. The explosion and its aftermath led to the largest Naval mutiny in US history, and it and the subsequent trial became major catalysts for the United States Navy to desegregate following the war.  History The national memorial, administered by the National Park Service, was authorized by Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 102–562 on October 28, 1992.  The memorial was dedicated in 1994 and is located on the grounds of the Military Ocean Terminal Concord (MOTCO), formerly the Tidal Area of the Concord Naval Weapons Station.  The memorial is only open to the public through reserved guided tours. On October 28, 2009, the Memorial became an official unit of the National Park System.  Plans The Port Chicago Committee is working toward expanding the current memorial to encompass 250 acres (1.0 km2) of the former Port Chicago waterfront.  The memorial site could include some of the railroad revetments and old boxcars from the 1940s period, as well as the existing memorial chapel, with stained-glass windows depicting the World War II operations.

The Pakistan Navy Strategic Forces Command (reporting name: NSFC), is a strategic and missile formation of the Pakistan Navy. Headquartered in Navy HQ in Islamabad, the strategic command controls sea-based guided and cruise missile system— both conventional and nuclear.  Formation was organized in 2004 based on and influenced from the army's formation in 2002, and is responsible only for sea-based strategic nuclear deterrence, which the Pakistan's government identifies it as "custodian of second-strike capability.  Military overview History Before 2000, the Pakistan Air Force had an effective and operational controls over the deployment, target selections, intelligence, computers and interoperability of the nation's strategic deterrence through its own strategic formation. Protecting Pakistan's maritime border became a realization after the short-lived border conflict with India in 1999 when Pakistani war strategists working at the Joint Staff HQ in Rawalpindi pointed that if the conflict would have entered in conventional scale, it would put Pakistan under serious disadvantage. As early as 2001, the Pakistani military strategists began to explore the idea of sea-based "Second strike" under navy rather than air force's control. The Navy HQ worked with the Army GHQ in Rawalpindi on establishing the sea-based deterrence and decided to commit greater resources for its development; consequently, tactics and strategic planning of Navy also underwent a shift. In 2000, the work on establishing the formation was started under the watchful guidance of Adm. Shahid Karimulla, who was then-Chief of Naval Staff, and strongly advocated for the pursuit of idea of "Second strike".  Admiral Karim rationalized that "since the Navy had been considering the deployment of nuclear weapons aboard its submarines-- it had to keep pace with developments in India." Although, Admiral Karim later left the option open, saying that the country had no plans to deploy nuclear weapons on its submarines, and that it would do so only if "forced to". In 2004, the formation was established within the Navy which was based on the army's strategic forces command, and inaugurated its first headquarters in 2012 with Vice-Admiral Tanveer Faiz becoming its first commander.  The military media command, the ISPR described the NSFC as the "custodian of the nation's 2nd strike capability, will strengthen Pakistan's policy of Credible Minimum Deterrence and ensure regional stability."  Employment Besides the Pakistan Army's strategic formation, the Naval Strategic Forces Command is the only military formation that maintains and controls the employment of the transporter erector launchers, which is a primary ground-based delivery system for coastal defenses only. The Naval Strategic Command is distributed among the Pakistan Navy's missile regiment and the air defense battalions of the Pakistan Marines, focusing on the southern border. The Navy's strategic formation is largely viewed as second-line capabilities that complement the principal land-based systems operated by the Army Strategic Force Command.

Laribacter hongkongensis is a species of bacteria. It is facultatively anaerobic, non-sporulating, gram-negative, seagull- or spiral rod-shaped. It is a potential human pathogen. Laribacter hongkongensis has been isolated from human cases of diarrhea, but its role in causing diarrhea is unproven, even though it has been hypothesized.  Additional studies are needed to better define its role as a possible enteric pathogen. These should include: case control studies designed to differentiate infection from colonization-transient passage, fulfilling Koch's postulates and Bradford-Hill's criteria on association vs. causation, possible virulence factors, animal models, host factors, antibody responses based on serodiagnostic testing, and human volunteer studies. The lessons learned from trying to establish the etiological role of the bacteria genera Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, and Edwardsiella in human diarrhea seem especially applicable for Laribacter. All four genera are isolated from extraintestinal infections, are apparently found in the aquatic environment, and epidemiological associations include eating fish and foreign travel. Even after over 50 years’ experience with the former three genera their etiological role in an individual case of human diarrhea is difficult to determine without extensive studies. For all four of these genera the critical issue will be differentiating infection from colonization or transient passage in the intestine.  References Further reading Woo PC, Lau SK, Tse H, et al.

Lars Andersen (born 8 November 1964) is a Danish painter and archer. Claiming to hold a world record for speed, he is able to shoot 10 arrows in 4.9 seconds, or 3 arrows in 0.6 seconds. A private student of Otto Frello, Andersen graduated from School of Visual Art. He describes himself as a Danish painter and writer. His video posted in November 2012 went viral across the web. Another one of his videos, "A New Level of Archery", was posted on YouTube on 23 January 2015, receiving over 23 million views in one week, in which Andersen demonstrates how to shoot while holding multiple arrows in his draw hand and shooting while on the move, jumping, close up, far away and hanging upside-down. However, many of the historical and scientific claims made in the video have been contested or discredited, and few of the ideas have gained traction with other archers and internet personalities. In April 2015, Lars responded to the claims against him and his technique. In the video, Lars attempts to clarify his statements, some of which were in agreement with arguments against some of his original videos claims, mainly that this style was forgotten or he re-invented it, but some of them countering the criticism against him, such as the texts he refers to in his video not including the topic of speed shooting and the archer's paradox. In a video posted on YouTube in 2017, Andersen demonstrated his ability to shoot arrows that turn in mid-flight. Archer Jim MacQuarrie criticized the video, stating that while the technique is effective for speed, it is not effective for accuracy or distance. MacQuarrie also criticized the accuracy of historical claims made in the video as "inaccurate" and "misleading".  Records Andersen broke the Guinness World Record of "The most consecutive arrows shot through a keyhole" with 7 shots in Lyngby, Denmark, on 1 June 2022.  References External links Official website

Reynold Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham of Sterborough, KG (c.1295–1361) was a medieval English knight and diplomat.  Life He was the son of Sir Reynold Cobham by Joan, the daughter and heir of William de Evere. This Reynold was the second son of John de Cobham, by his first wife Joan the daughter of William Fitzbenedict. The family were based at Sterborough Castle, Lingfield, Surrey. In his early life he was employed on diplomatic missions. By 1334 he was a knight in the household of King Edward III and fought in the Scottish campaign against David de Bruce and then on the continent in the Low Countries and Brittany. In 1342 he was summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Cobham of Sterborough. In 1346 he was in the force under Edward III that attacked France, fighting at the Battle of Crécy and the protracted but eventually successful Siege of Calais. In 1352 he was invested as a Knight of the Garter and in 1353 appointed Captain of Calais, a position he held until his death. In 1355 he served under the Edward the Black Prince in Aquitaine, taking part in his march to the Loire and his victory at the Battle of Poitiers, where he was credited by the French historian Jean Froissart with the slaying of the French knight Geoffroi de Charny. Reynold married Joan Berkeley by whom he could claim to be related to the noble families of Sutton, Dudley, Beauchamp, De Despencer and Mortimer. The Cobham family, however, were well connected to the ruling families of England in their own right. He died in 1361, probably of the plague, and was laid to rest in an impressive tomb in Lingfield church. He was succeeded by his son Reynold, the second Lord Sterborough.  References Fleming, Peter.

Cephea cephea, also known as the crown jellyfish, or cauliflower jellyfish, is a species of jellyfish in the family Cepheidae. It occurs in the tropical waters of the western Indo-Pacific to Northern Australia. The species was first described by Peter Forsskål in 1775 and originally given the name Medusa cephea. It inhabits the pelagic zone of tropical and sub-tropical waters and is most commonly found in the Indo-West Pacific, eastern Atlantic and the Red Sea. Although this species is among the most venomous jellyfish, it is not harmful to humans and is eaten as a delicacy and used for medical purposes in China and Japan. The species can achieve a diameter of up to 60 cm.  Description Cephea cephea is purplish-blue in color and grow to up to 60 centimeters in diameter. This species has wart-like projections and a bell shape that is associated with the given common names for the species. As in other jellyfish species, the tentacles contain nematocysts that are used to stun, kill and grapple prey items. Its lifespan is approximately three to six months. These jellyfish are 95% water.  Ecology This species of jellyfish is known to live in the Pelagic zone of the ocean in the Indo-West Pacific, Eastern Atlantic and the Red Sea. They live and thrive in cold water and can be found as deep as over 3,000 feet below the surface. The species is bioluminescent. During the day it tends to remain in deeper waters, migrating to surface waters at night. Its prey mainly consists of algae, shrimp, plankton, invertebrate eggs and invertebrate larvae. The most common known predators of the species are sea turtles.  Reproduction The reproduction cycle is similar to many other jellyfish. Adults release sperm or egg into the water; fertilized eggs form planula larvae. The planula then attaches itself to a rock or similar structure that allows it to grow into a polyp. Asexual reproduction then occurs meaning the polyp essentially clones itself and develop into another stage called the ephyra. The last process is the growth and development into an adult medusa jellyfish. Water temperature and food supply influence the efficiency of the asexual reproduction phase.  Venom and human use Cephea cephea is known to be one of the most venomous jellyfish. Although they have large amounts of venom deadly to their prey, their stings and venom is not harmful to humans. They are actually known to be eaten by humans located mostly in Japan and China. The dish is a delicacy in the Japanese and Chinese cultures. This particular species of jellyfish is used also used for medicinal purposes for humans.

KETR (88.9 FM) is a 100-kW noncommercial broadcast radio station operating in Commerce, Texas, licensed to Texas A&M University-Commerce. A member of the National Public Radio network, the station serves nearly 250,000 Northeast Texas homes. The staff is composed of radio professionals and  Texas A&M-Commerce students who major in either journalism or mass communication studies. KETR also produces original long-form and short-form radio programming.  History KETR began in the early 1970s as the director of the East Texas State University radio-television program, Dr. David Rigney, developed an FCC application for an FM station that would be a teaching laboratory for students. KETR's first broadcast went on the air on April 7, 1975. The station operated in a former classroom on the first floor of the Journalism Building, with Phil Ebensberger, a veteran Texas commercial radio broadcaster, as general manager and morning-show host. The weekday programming originally emphasized local news, information, and middle-of-the-road music from early-morning sign-on to early afternoon; classical music in the early afternoon (this was soon replaced by jazz); National Public Radio’s All Things Considered in the late afternoon; various public affairs programs in the early evening, including live broadcasts of Commerce City Commission meetings; and Freeform, a student-hosted rock music program from 9 pm to midnight.  Weekend programs predominantly featured classical music or opera, such as the long-running Texaco Metropolitan Opera broadcasts. In 1977, the station moved from its quarters in the Journalism Building to new studios in the Performing Arts Center, where it shared facilities with the Radio-TV program.  KETR remained in the Performing Arts Center until it moved to new facilities in Binnion Hall in 2008. In the early 1980s, after Ebensberger departed, general manager Bill Oellermann obtained FCC approval and a grant to raise KETR’s tower height and to increase power from about 10,000 watts to 100,000 watts.  This increased the station’s broadcast range from about 20 miles to 75 miles. After moving away from National Public Radio programming in the mid-1980s, KETR once again features All Things Considered and Morning Edition, among other NPR programs.  KETR was one of the original stations carrying Morning Edition when it debuted in 1979.  Local programs KETR has several programs that focus on Commerce and the Northeast Texas area. Counties that are typically covered with local news in addition to Hunt County, where Commerce is located, are neighboring Rockwall, Collin, Fannin, Hopkins, Delta, and Rains Counties. Among the local shows are:  Notably Texan' is focused on Texas music and Texas musicians with host Matt Meinke.   North by Northeast is a weekly call-in show presenting "Stories that matter to Northeast Texas". Topics include development, education, health care, the environment, and the economy. Sports and fine arts are also featured. Outdoors With Luke Clayton, hosted by Hunter and Angler Luke Clayton, focuses on hunting, angling, and outdoor activity. Buried is a podcast created by host/reporter George Hale and KETR General Manager Jerrod Knight, a documentary-style podcast that uncovers details about the case of Carey Mae Parker, a young rural-Texas mother of three who disappeared 19 years before being reported missing.  National and other nonlocal programs Morning Edition All Things Considered BBC World Service Sunday Baroque TED Radio Hour Texas Standard Texas Matters Bullseye with Jesse Thorn  Sports programming KETR sports programming began in the fall of 1975, with student-produced broadcasts of Commerce High School Tigers football. Ebensberger and former ETSU All-American quarterback Sam McCord served as the voices of ETSU Lions football. The first Commerce Tigers broadcast featured the Tigers playing at rival Honey Grove, with future ETSU All-American and NFL quarterback Wade Wilson leading the Commerce offense. The first college football broadcast was the Lions’ 42-10 win over Prairie View A&M in the Cotton Bowl. KETR also broadcast Commerce Tigers basketball and A&M-Commerce Lion basketball, continuing to this day. KETR followed the Lions to NAIA basketball tournament appearances in Kansas City in 1977 and 1978. KETR serves as the flagship station for the Lion Sports Network. The station covers Texas A&M-Commerce football, A&M-Commerce men's and women's basketball, and Commerce High School football. Longtime Texas sports Broadcaster Charlie Chitwood serves as play-by-play announcer and TAMUC alumnus Brock Callaway provides color commentary.  Station coverage The station is typically received well in an 80-mile radius in all directions. The station's signal can easily be heard west to Dallas, north into Hugo, Oklahoma, southeast to Canton, Texas, and east to Mount Vernon. The quality of the signal can sometimes be affected by topographical anomalies such as lakes or hills; areas north and west are typically not affected due to the generally flat topography. Too, the signal is simulcast globally via online stream at the station's website, which is accessible on most internet-connected devices.  HD Radio KETR launched HD Radio operations in July 2023, including a HD2 sub-channel called "The Lion" devoted to 24/7  Triple-A (adult album alternative) music playlist which is provided by XPoNential Radio.

52nd (Manchester) Field Regiment was a Royal Artillery (RA) unit of Britain's part-time Territorial Army (TA) during World War II. It was descended from the Manchester Artillery, first formed in the City of Manchester in 1860. It served in the Battle of France, at the end of which its personnel were evacuated from Dunkirk. It was then sent to the Middle East where it joined 8th Indian Division and fought with this division in the Italian Campaign. It was reformed in the postwar TA, and its successor unit continues as a battery in the present day Army Reserve  Origin The Manchester Artillery was formed as part of the Volunteer Force in 1860. By the outbreak of World War I it was a 'brigade' of the Royal Field Artillery (RFA) in the East Lancashire Division of the Territorial Force. During World War I it served with the division (later the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division) in Egypt before being broken up in 1917. Its second line unit fought with the 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division on the Western Front 1917–18. It reformed after the war, becoming the 52nd (Manchester) Brigade, RFA, when the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921, with the following organisation:  Brigade Headquarters at Hyde Road, Ardwick, Manchester 205, 206, 207 (East Lancashire) Batteries 208 (East Lancashire) Battery (Howitzer) The brigade was once again part of 42nd (EL) Divisional Artillery. In 1924 the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery (RA), and the word 'Field' was inserted into the titles of its brigades and batteries. In 1938 the RA modernised its nomenclature and a lieutenant-colonel's command was designated a 'regiment' rather than a 'brigade'; this applied to TA field brigades from 1 November 1938. The TA was doubled in size after the Munich Crisis, and most regiments formed duplicates. Part of the reorganisation was that field regiments changed from four six-gun batteries to an establishment of two batteries, each of three four-gun troops. For the Manchester Artillery this resulted in the following organisation from 25 May 1939:  52nd (Manchester) Field Regiment  Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) at Hyde Road, Manchester 205 (East Lancashire) Field Bty 206 (East Lancashire) Field Bty 110th Field Regiment  RHQ at Gorton 207 (East Lancashire) Field Bty 208 (East Lancashire) Field Bty The Manchester Artillery mobilised on 1 September 1939, just before the outbreak of war, as part of 42nd (EL) Infantry Division, but from 27 September the newly formed 66th Infantry Division took over the duplicate units including 110th Fd Rgt.  World War II On the outbreak of war 52nd Fd Rgt commanded by Lt-Col E.T. Turner was still equipped with 18-pounder guns and 4.5-inch howitzers from World War I, but while it was training at Haltwhistle in Northumberland it received its first five 18/25-pounders for trial. This stop-gap equipment consisted of the new 25-pounder gun mounted on an 18-pdr carriage with pneumatic tyres. On 22 January 1940 the regiment moved to Newbury, Berkshire, and on 14 March a Regular Army officer, Lt-Col F.C.F. Cleeve, took command. In April 42nd (EL) Division began crossing to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and 52nd Fd Rgt arrived on 14 April, fully equipped with 18/25-pdrs.  Battle of France 52nd Field Rgt was stationed at Lomme, east of Lille, by 25 April 1940. When the German offensive began on 10 May, the BEF advanced into Belgium under Plan D, and by 15 May its leading divisions were in place on the River Dyle. 42nd (EL) Division was to move up to positions further back on the River Escaut in France, so on 16 May 52nd Fd Rgt's advance parties left Lomme for Blandain, west of Tournai. The regiment moved to Cappelle-en-Pévèle next day and by 18 May RHQ was established in a farm at Auchy-lez-Orchies, 205 Bty at Coutiches, south of Orchies with an observation post (OP) at Râches, and 206 Bty nearby at Le Molinel, with an OP at Marchiennes, north-east of Douai. But the Wehrmacht's breakthrough in the Ardennes threatened the BEF's flank, and it had to retreat again. On 19 May 205 Bty moved independently to join 138 Bde of 46th Division at Thumeries and took up anti-tank (A/T) positions spread along 6–7 miles (9.7–11.3 km) of the River Scarpe. 206 Battery remained in position, except F Trp, which took up similar A/T positions along the canal at Saint-Amand-les-Eaux. By 21 May the whole BEF was back on the Escaut. As the Germans thrust behind the BEF, 42nd (EL) Division found itself south of Lille and facing east. By 26 May. RHQ was controlling a group consisting of 206 Bty (13 guns) and 2nd Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery (16 guns), with the latter falling back to Mont des Cats; 205 Bty was detached to 2nd Division. On that day the decision was made to evacuate the BEF through Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo). By 28 May Mont des Cats was held by an assorted force of artillery and engineers from 44th (Home Counties) Division, together with some scattered infantry and the remnants of 2nd RHA (two guns) and 52nd (Manchester) Fd Rgt. This rearguard held its position until the rest of 44th (HC) Division had withdrawn to Dunkirk. 42nd Divisional Artillery including 52nd Fd Rgt was evacuated on 30 May, but 205 Bty was still fighting with 2nd Division and did not get away until 2 June.  Home defence Units returning from France were rapidly reinforced, re-equipped with whatever was available, and deployed for home defence. 52nd Field Rgt assembled at Darlington, County Durham, and then moved to Haydon Bridge in Northumberland where it carried out infantry training. In August, while it was at Hexham, eight World War I French M1897 75mm field guns arrived from the US under Lend-Lease. The regiment next moved to Bedale in North Yorkshire then, when 42nd (EL) Division went south to join IV Corps in September, it was at Lambourn and then Hampstead Norreys in Berkshire. By now it had received eight 4.5-inch howitzers. It continued training, and eventually was fully equipped with Mk II 25-pounders. One of the lessons learned from the Battle of France was that the two-battery organisation did not work: field regiments were intended to support an infantry brigade of three battalions. As a result, they were reorganised into three 8-gun batteries, but it was not until late 1940 that the RA had enough trained battery staffs to carry out the reorganisation. 52nd Field Rgt accordingly formed 'R' Bty, and this was numbered as 437 Fd Bty by 29 March 1941. At this time the regiment was stationed at Yoxford in Suffolk when 42nd (EL) Division was serving in XI Corps. In the autumn of 1941 it was decided to convert 42nd (EL) Division into an armoured division.  52nd (Manchester) and 53rd (Bolton) Fd Rgts left on 20 October, and joined 76th Infantry Division on 18 November 1941 when that was formed from the Norfolk County Division. The division remained defending Norfolk as part of II Corps. During 1942 large reinforcements were sent from the UK to Middle East Forces, and 52nd Fd Rgt was chosen to join them. It left 76th Division on 23 August 1942 and together with its signal section of the Royal Corps of Signals it came under War Office control preparatory to embarkation.  Middle East The regiment landed in Egypt and moved on to Iraq, arriving on 18 January 1943, when it came under the command of 8th Indian Division (along with 53rd (Bolton) Fd Rgt). The division was in Tenth Army, forming part of Paiforce defending the vital oilfields of Iraq and Persia and the line of communications with the Soviet Union. By the spring of 1943 the victories in North Africa and on the Eastern Front had removed the threat to the oilfields, and troops could be released from Paiforce for other theatres. 8th Indian Division moved to Ninth Army in Syria with 52nd Fd Rgt arriving on 6 May 1943. 8th Indian Division was then selected for the forthcoming Italian Campaign. 52nd Field Rgt arrived back in Egypt on 15 September and then embarked with the division for Italy on 18 September.  Italy 8th Indian Division began disembarking at Brindisi on 23 September, where 52nd Fd Rgt arrived next day. The division joined V Corps, which was leading Eight Army's advance up the east coast of Italy. Operations were slowed by rain and mud, but on the night of 1/2 November 8 Indian Division began attacking across the River Trigno, part of the Barbara Line. 1st Battalion 13th Frontier Force Rifles fought its way up the wooded spurs against the German 3rd Parachute Regiment, and the following night 3rd Bn 8th Punjab Regiment crossed the river to add its weight. On the night of 3/4 November the two battalions attacked Tufillo, 'taking in their stride a German counter-attack which was blown to pieces by the divisional artillery'. There was confused fighting in the dark amongst burning scrub, and by morning the two battalions were pinned down under heavy fire. The Germans were however being forced to thin out their defences, and the paratroopers withdrew, allowing the whole of 8th Indian Division to advance.  Mozzagrogna The Germans took up another delaying position, the Bernhardt Line, behind the River Sangro. Eighth Army closed up to the river on 9 November and prepared to assault the position. 78th Division developed a bridgehead, and on 27 November, after the flooded river had fallen, 8th Indian Division took Mozzagrogna on the escarpment beyond. A German counter-attack recaptured the village early on 28 November, but a fresh attack by 1st Bn 12th Frontier Force Regiment, accompanied by all the divisional and corps artillery, finally captured it by 01.30 on 29 November. The following night 1st Bn 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles and 1/12th FFR captured the dominating ground beyond Mozzagrogna, completing the rupture of the Bernhardt Line. The division continued to advance with short, powerfully supported attacks against stubborn resistance, where artillery ammunition supply became the limiting factor. Winter weather brought an end to operations in late December.  Monte Cassino Eighth Army regrouped during the winter months, and 8th Indian Division moved to XIII Corps for the Spring offensive. This corps would be operating in the Liri Valley as part of the renewed attack on Monte Cassino (Operation Diadem). First XIII Corps carried out a setpiece assault crossing of the Rapido or Gari River (part of the German Gustav line), with an artillery programme starting at 23.00 on 11 May. Every gun was employed for the next 12 hours in counter-battery (CB) and counter-mortar fire, with the field guns concentrating on the German mortars and Nebelwerfers. At 00.45 on 12 May  8th Indian Division launched its assault boats and the field guns switched to providing a Creeping barrage, followed by timed concentrations on selected targets. A dense mist screened the assault points but caused confusion for the attackers and both attacking brigades got left behind by the barrage. Nevertheless, after hard fighting they achieved a bridgehead and before nightfall the Sappers had laid two bridges to allow tanks to cross. Next day 1/5th Gurkha Rifles, supported by tanks and seven field artillery regiments, took the village of San Angelo at the third attempt, and on 14 and 15 May the division cleared the tongue of land between the Liri and the Gari and pressed on westwards as the Germans fell back to the Hitler Line. The artillery had to be brought up before the next bound, the advance north of the Liri on 25 May, but then its CB fire totally suppressed the German artillery, which fell silent every time an air observation post spotter aircraft appeared. While the armoured divisions advanced up the roads, the lightly equipped 8th Indian Division took to the narrow tracks through the hills, driving German rearguards from the hilltop towns. On the night on 1/2 June the division moved cross-country to Vico nel Lazio, bridging streams and gullies as it went and reaching the town on the afternoon of 3 June. The Germans then pulled back to the Trasimene Line and Fifth US Army entered Rome next day. For the pursuit to Lake Trasimeno, 8th Indian Division came under X Corps, leading its advance on minor roads through the hill country east of Rome. Perugia was captured without much opposition on 19/20 June, then X Corps struck north up the Tiber valley, with 8th Indian Division making for Sansepolcro. On 26 June it caught an unprepared German division and inflicted heavy casualties. 8th Indian Division had been in almost continuous fighting for nine months, and was now relieved for rest and refit.  Operation Olive 8th Indian Division returned to the front line with XIII Corps in the Elsa Valley later in July. The corps employed its overwhelming superiority in artillery to drive towards Florence, which the Germans evacuated. The forces then had to be regrouped to attack the Gothic Line in Operation Olive. 8th Indian Division crossed the River Arno in a preliminary operation on 21 August, and then advanced into the roadless mountains where it could not take its artillery. It captured Monte Femmina Morta on 18 September, easing the advance through the Casaglia Pass. Afterwards it advanced down the Faenza road, opening the routes into the Lamone Valley for heavy equipment and supplies, but further progress through the mountains was slow. The gunners had particular problems in firing over crests to hit targets behind. The division maintained pressure on the German positions during October to prevent them moving troops elsewhere. Artillery ammunition had to be rationed from November, but 8th Indian Divisional Artillery, operating in the critical junction between Eighth Army and Fifth US Army, was exempt and received ample supplies. The division kept up small offensive operations into the winter, despite the supply difficulties in the mountains. On 26 December the Germans launched a counter-attack (the Battle of Garfagnana) between Lucca and Pistoia towards Livorno, but 8th Indian Division had already been rushed west to bolster the US sector concerned. The Germans broke through until they were stopped at the Indians' positions, when 8th Indian Division took over control of the sector, but the German attack was not pressed. The division was relieved for rest on 8 January 1945.  Operation Grapeshot 8th Indian Division was back with Eighth Army for the Allies' spring offensive in Italy, Operation Grapeshot. It was given the task of an assault crossing of the River Senio, with massive artillery support added to its own guns, and ample ammunition stocks built up during the winter. The German positions, dug into the floodbank of the river, presented a challenging linear target, so many of the guns fired in enfilade from the flanks. The operation was launched on 9 April. At 15.00 the assault troops withdrew to a safe distance while the artillery and air bombardment was carried out. Then at 19.20 the assault infantry went in, with a protective barrage laid on the far side of the river. Opposition remained strong on 8th Indian Division's front, but after bitter fighting through the night it secured its objectives by midday on 10 April. It then fought its way forward to the River Santerno and secured crossings during the night of 11/12 April. 78th Division then passed through 8th Indian Division to continue the advance. As Eighth Army advanced towards the River Po, 8th Indian Division came back into the widening line, attacking up the Via Adriatica until it ran into opposition at the airfield south-west of Ferrara on 22 April. After a 36-hour fight the division thrust round the western city of the city and got to the Po on 23 April, possibly the first troops of Eighth Army to reach it. The division then planned for another assault crossing, but German resistance was crumbling and opposition to its crossing on the night of 25/26 April was negligible. The division was then 'grounded' as its transport was taken to support Eighth Army's rapid drive to Venice and Trieste. Hostilities on the Italian Front ended on 2 May with the Surrender of Caserta, but 8th Indian Division had already been withdrawn from the line on 29 April. It had been selected as the first Indian formation to transfer from Italy to the Far East theatre to fight the Japanese. It left in June 1945, when all the British units attached to it reverted to the British establishment and returned home. 52nd Field Rgt and the other units had been overseas for over two years and most of their personnel were due for repatriation under the government's 'Python' scheme. 52nd (Manchester) Fd Rgt embarked for the UK on 27 July and passed into suspended animation on 3 November 1945.  Postwar The TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, when 52nd Fd Rgt was reformed as 252 (Manchester) Fd Rgt in 42nd (Lancashire) Division. When the TA was reduced in 1961, the regiment absorbed the RHQ and P (Manchester) and R (Stockport) Btys of 314 Heavy Anti-Aircraft Rgt (a merger of several Lancashire regiments, including its own duplicate 110th (Manchester) Fd Rgt), which provided P and R Btys of the new 252 (Manchester) Fd Rgt. The TA was further reduced into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) on 1967, when the regiment formed Battery HQ and D & E Trps of 209 Light Air Defence Bty (The Manchester Artillery) in 103 (Lancashire Artillery Volunteers) Light AD Rgt. This battery continues in today's Army Reserve, based at Belle Vue Army Reserve Centre in Manchester.  Insignia From 1947 to 1961 252 (Manchester) Fd Rgt wore a regimental arm badge based on the coat of arms of the City of Manchester, consisting of a red shield bearing three offset gold diagonal stripes (Gules three Bendlets enhanced Or) in an ornate gold outline, surmounted by a Griffin's head, on a blue backing.

Vladimir Mikhailovich Vinogradov (2 August 1921 – 21 June 1997) was a prominent Soviet diplomat in the second half of the 20th century.  Early life Vinogradov was born in 1921 in Vinnytsia, Ukraine. In 1945, he earned a degree in engineering and technology in Moscow; three years later, he graduated from the All-Union Academy of Foreign Trade. After finishing his studies, he was appointed assistant to the commercial representative of the Soviet Union in London. Vinogradov returned to Moscow four years later to work in the central apparatus of the Ministry of Trade. He served as the Deputy Chief of the Department of Commerce for the next ten years, dealing mostly with western countries.  Diplomatic career From 1962 to 1966, Vinogradov was the ambassador of the USSR in Japan; he served as Ambassador to Egypt from 1970 to 1974. At the beginning of 1975, Vinogradov acted as the initiator of a rapprochement between the USSR and Jordan. From February 1977 to April 1982, Vinogradov was the ambassador of the USSR in Iran. After this assignment, Vinogradov was appointed to the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (one of the republics of the USSR).

John  Michael Lane (February 14, 1936 – October 21, 2020) was an American epidemiologist who was a director of the Epidemic Intelligence Service's Global Smallpox Eradication program from 1973 to 1981, and who played a leading role in the eradication of smallpox in 1977.  Early life John Michael Lane was born on February 14, 1936, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Eileen O'Connor and Alfred Baker Lewis.  His mother was on the national board of the YWCA and a director of Planned Parenthood, and his father was a pro bono lawyer for the early NAACP and later a treasurer of the organization.  Lane had two brothers, a half-brother, and two half-sisters. When he was six, his family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, where Lane studied at the private Brunswick School.  He graduated with a bachelor's degree from Yale University in 1957; a medical degree from Harvard University in 1961; and a public health epidemiology degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1967.  Lane completed his internship at the Bellevue Hospital, in New York.  Career Lane started his career as an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Epidemic Intelligence Service in 1963. He was assigned to the smallpox and other infectious diseases division within CDC. During this time, he traveled to countries in Africa and south-east Asia, including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, to undertake vaccination campaigns and combat outbreaks of the disease. In 1973, Lane was appointed as the director of the Global Smallpox Eradication program. He served in this position through 1981 as the last director of the program, successfully overseeing the eradication of the disease in 1977.  The last case of the disease was reported in Somalia in 1977, and it was declared as having been eradicated in 1980.  Speaking later about the strategies adopted, Lane recounted the role of volunteers who administered the vaccines, and the vaccination process itself.  He spoke of the importance of cooperating with local tribal regional leaders to ensure that the programs were administered to local populations. An additional strategy that was adopted to circumvent the shortage of vaccines was to move from 'mass vaccination' to 'ring vaccination', with the latter strategy focused on 'surveillance and containment', and targeted vaccination within villages with known victims.   Following his role with the Smallpox Eradication program, Lane stayed with the CDC through 1987 as a director of the Center for Prevention Services.  He went on to teach at Emory University in Atlanta between 1988 and 1991, and at the Australian National University between 1991 and 1993, where he helped set up the Australian Field Epidemiology Training Program and served as the program director.  Lane returned to teach at Emory University in 1993 and continued through 2001.   In the early 21st century, Lane was a proponent for the destruction of the existing stocks of smallpox vaccine because of its potential usage as a bio-terrorist weapon, and pleaded that Russia and the United States destroy their remaining vaccines.  Personal life Lane married Carolina Hernandez in 1969. The couple divorced in 1998.  He subsequently married Lila Elizabeth Summer in 1998. Lane was an avid bird-watcher, trekker, and scuba diver. He completed a trek across the United States from Atlanta to Seattle when he was 79. Lane died from colon cancer on October 21, 2020, at his home in Atlanta.

Graham Mertz (born December 6, 2000) is an American football quarterback for the Florida Gators. He previously played for the Wisconsin Badgers before transferring to Florida in 2023.  Early life and high school career Mertz's first two years of high school were spent at Bishop Miege High School in Roeland Park, Kansas. While there, he played high school football and backed up all-state quarterback Carter Putz. Before his junior year, Mertz transferred to Blue Valley North High School in Overland Park, Kansas after his teammates complained about his attitude. He led Blue Valley North to a Class 6A state championship as a junior, and to state runner-up as a senior. In his senior year he completed 61.1% of his passes for 3,886 yards and a state-record 51 touchdowns. He was a finalist for the Elite 11 quarterback competition in 2018, and was named Gatorade Kansas Football Player of the Year. Graham was invited to the All-American Bowl after his senior season, where he set a bowl record with five touchdown passes and was named game MVP. Mertz was rated as a four-star recruit by ESPN, 247Sports.com, and Rivals.com. ESPN rated him as the best pocket passer in the class of 2019 and 21st highest rated recruit overall. In the 247Sports Composite, Mertz was rated as the third-highest rated pro-style quarterback, the highest rated Kansas recruit, and 65th highest rated recruit overall. Mertz committed to play football at the University of Wisconsin–Madison on October 9, 2017.  College career University of Wisconsin 2019 Three-year Wisconsin starting quarterback Alex Hornibrook announced that he would be transferring to Florida State for the 2019 season, leaving the starting role open for competition between Mertz and junior Jack Coan. ESPN described Mertz as Wisconsin's "most hyped QB since Russell Wilson." Mertz ultimately lost the starting job to Coan, and redshirted his true freshman season after appearing in two games.  2020 With Coan injured in practice before the 2020 season, Mertz began the season as the starting quarterback, becoming the first freshman quarterback to start a season-opening game for the Badgers since 1978. Mertz started the game with 17 consecutive completed passes, tying the school record, and his final line of 20-for-21 broke the school single-game completion percentage record with 95.2%. His five passing touchdowns in the 45–7 win over Illinois also tied the school single-game record. He was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week and Freshman of the Week for the performance. The day after the Illinois game, Mertz tested positive for COVID-19, in what would prove to be a team-wide outbreak that forced the cancellation of their next two games against Nebraska and Purdue. Mertz recovered in time for the team's next game against Michigan, which the Badgers won 49–11, despite a more subdued performance from Mertz, who threw for 127 yards and two touchdowns in the game. Wisconsin lost its next three games, against Northwestern, Indiana, and Iowa, with Mertz throwing four interceptions to just one passing touchdown during that stretch. In the final game of the regular season, against rival Minnesota, played on Big Ten Championship Saturday, Mertz left the game in the third quarter with an ankle injury. The Badgers eventually won in overtime, 20–17. The Badgers were invited to play against Wake Forest in the Duke's Mayo Bowl. Mertz went 11-for-17, with 130 passing yards and one touchdown in the 42–28 win. After the game, Mertz dropped the trophy in the locker room celebration, shattering the football made of glass on the top of the trophy.  2021 Mertz served as the starting quarterback in all 13 games for Wisconsin during his redshirt sophomore season in 2021, leading the Badgers to a 9–4 record and a victory in the Las Vegas Bowl. He finished the season with 1,958 passing yards, 10 passing touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.  2022 Mertz served as the starting quarterback for Wisconsin once again in his redshirt junior season in 2022, leading the Badgers to a 6–6 regular season record. In a 42–7 win against Northwestern on October 8, he set a career high with 299 passing yards and five touchdown passes. He finished the season with 2,136 passing yards, 19 passing touchdowns, and 10 interceptions. On December 4, 2022, prior to Wisconsin's bowl game, Mertz announced he was entering the transfer portal.  Florida Mertz transferred and joined the Florida Gators in the spring semester of 2023.

The Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration is a museum of immigration history located in the 12th arrondissement of Paris at 293, avenue Daumesnil. The nearest métro station is Porte Dorée. It is open Tuesday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and weekends from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; an admission fee of  €4.50 is charged. The museum was conceived in 1989 by Algerian immigrant Zaïr Kedadouche, supported initially by historians including Pierre Milza and Gérard Noiriel, but the idea was paused in 1993. The 1998 French World Cup win reunified the people of France, and former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin approved its creation almost immediately. Years passed and hope for the Museum to come to fruition faded until President Jacques Chirac was reelected in 2002. He put Jacques Toubon in charge of bringing the Museum to life with a mission to "contribute to the recognition of the integration of immigrants into French society and advance the views and attitudes on immigration in France". It opened without public ceremony in late 2007 under his successor, President Nicolas Sarkozy, amid political controversy in which eight of the twelve academics involved in the project resigned. The museum occupies the Palais de la Porte Dorée, a historical monument in Paris, which was built in 1931 to serve as the Colonial International Exhibition's museum dedicated to the colonies. Owing to the Palais de la Porte Dorée's colonial history and deep ties to the French Empire, space in the museum is dedicated to informing guests of its history, and one of the first temporary exhibits was of the year 1931. However, there is also some controversy surrounding the theme of reducing all immigration to colonialist origin which can be seen as demeaning and confusing to some. The museum was also formerly the home of the Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie, on the edge of the Bois de Vincennes. Its tropical aquarium is still located in the cellar and remains open to the public. It contains over 1100 m2 of exhibition space devoted primarily to the history and culture of immigration in France from the early nineteenth century to the present. A permanent installation, "Benchmarks", contains interactive exhibits presenting immigrant stories in multimedia form. The Abdelmalek Sayad multimedia library house, which is located in the museum, contains a diverse collection of books, films, and other types of media related to the themes of the museum. The collection is accessible online through the museum's portal. The museum's collections are organized by three main themes: images including photography by Eugène Atget, Gérald Bloncourt, Robert Capa, Yves Jackson, Jean Jacques Pottier, etc., as well as prints, posters, drawings press, cartoons, comic books, audiovisual materials; objects of daily life; and works of art concerning immigration, territory, borders, and roots. In May 2019 it hosted an event with the artist Adelaide Damoah during Museum Week.

Perfect Strangers (United States title: Vacation from Marriage), is a 1945 British drama film made by London Films. It stars Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr as a married couple whose relationship is shaken by their service in the Second World War. The supporting cast includes Glynis Johns, Ann Todd and Roland Culver. It was produced and directed by Alexander Korda from a screenplay by Clemence Dane and Anthony Pelissier based on a story by Clemence Dane. Dane won the Academy Award for Best Story. The music score was by Clifton Parker and the cinematography by Georges Périnal.  Plot Robert and Cathy Wilson are a timid married couple in 1940 London. He is a bookkeeper, she a bored housewife. However, their tedious lives are changed by the war. He enlists in the Royal Navy, and she joins the Women's Royal Naval Service. During the three years the couple are apart (their shore leaves never coincide), they are transformed, each becoming much more self-confident. Dizzy Clayton, Cathy's assertive new friend, helps her break out of her shell. She begins going out with Dizzy's cousin, naval architect Richard, who falls in love with her. However, she remains unenthusiastically faithful to her husband. Meanwhile, Robert becomes tougher on sea duty, and in time, he becomes a petty officer. His hands are badly burned when his ship is sunk, but he stoically rows in the lifeboat for five days without complaint. He recuperates in a hospital, tended by Elena, a beautiful nurse. On the last night of his stay, he asks her out to dinner. He is attracted to her, but she informs him that she lost her beloved husband only six months earlier, kisses him, and leaves. Robert and Cathy both receive 10-day leaves, but each dreads being reunited with the dowdy spouse each remembers and being forced back into the dreary life they shared. Cathy cannot bring herself to return to her flat, where Robert is waiting. Instead, she phones Robert, asking him to talk with her on more neutral ground and blurting that she wants to leave him. He is furious. They meet on the street in the pitch dark of the blackout. To her surprise, Robert readily agrees to a divorce, telling her that he was going to ask her for one. They go to the neighbourhood pub to discuss the divorce, and for the first time in three years, they see the transformation in the other. Throughout the film, they have been talking to their new friends about their life together, and now they revisit those issues and talk honestly to each other about the past. They find that if they are "perfect strangers" now. For Cathy, the hated view from their flat, all walls and smoking chimneys, is a symbol of their lives before the war. They dance with each other for the first time, and they clearly are attracted. Dizzy and Robert's friend Scotty meet them in the pub. Both are stunned. Dizzy thinks Cathy is crazy. Scotty calls Cathy a pin-up, but the compliment goes wrong when he shares Robert's unflattering descriptions of the 'old' Cathy. She is insulted and furious. It hardens her heart, and she leaves as the pub closes. Outside, waiting in vain for a taxi in the bombed-out intersection, the argument continues—they even fight over where the shops were formerly located. In the end, Scotty goes to his billet, leaving Robert on the street. The girls go to the flat, where Cathy wistfully tells Dizzy about how she and Robert met. Robert returns to retrieve his gear and finds Cathy sitting in the corner of the windowseat. The sky is bright with early morning light, and beyond the shattered houses, the vista toward the river is broken only by a church steeple. The high walls and smoking chimneys are gone. Robert opens the window, letting in the sounds of the city. A clock strikes 5. He turns to look at Cathy, saying “Well, you've certainly got the view you always wanted.” “Miles and miles of it,” she replies. “But oh Robert, the desolation.” “Poor old London,” he says, looking out the window. “Well, we'll just have to build it up again. That's all.” “It will take years and years,” Cathy says, her eyes on him. He reaches out to put his hand on hers, and then turns toward her, saying “Well, what does that matter? We're young.” Cathy lifts her head to meet him, and they embrace passionately.  Cast Robert Donat as Robert Wilson Deborah Kerr as Cathy Wilson Glynis Johns as Dizzy Clayton Ann Todd as Elena Roland Culver as Richard Elliott Mason as Mrs. Hemmings Cast notes  Deborah Kerr made her MGM debut in this film.  MGM had purchased half of her contract after her performance in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, in which she played three roles.  MGM studio boss Louis B. Mayer is supposed to have said "That girl's a star" upon seeing her performance in Perfect Strangers, and she was soon an established MGM property. This was Robert Donat's last film for MGM. Roger Moore made his uncredited film debut in Perfect Strangers.  Production Perfect Strangers was meant to be the first of a number of British-made co-productions between Alexander Korda and M-G-M. Other proposed projects included Lottie Dundass with Vivien Leigh from a story by Edith Bagnold, a biopic of Robert Louis Stevenson starring Robert Donat, a version of War and Peace directed by Orson Welles and starring Korda's wife, Merle Oberon, and an untitled Carol Reed project. Perfect Strangers was meant to star Donat and Oberon but by December 1943 Oberon had been replaced by Deborah Kerr as Oberon was still in the U.S. Wesley Ruggles was to come from Hollywood to direct. By March 1944, the film was about to start filming at Denham Studios. Korda announced he would now make only one to three films per year, compared to the 12 to 16 he had previously intended to make. Shooting did not  begin until May. The delay had come about for several reasons: the script was constantly rewritten to account for changes in the war, Ruggles fell ill with the flu shortly after he arrived in England, and Donat was involved in a play. Then Donat fell ill and Ruggles left the project after an argument with Korda. It was the first feature Korda had directed since Rembrandt. As they set to work, Korda called the film an "allegory of England"; Donat said: "It's a lyrical comedy – we hope." The film did some location shooting in Scotland, but was shot primarily in London. No subsequent films came from the agreement, because Korda bristled at being bossed around by MGM's head of production, Louis B. Mayer.  Reception Box office Perfect Strangers was a commercial success in both the UK and the US, where it was re-titled Vacation from Marriage. It was one of the bigger hits at the British box office in 1945, ranked 22nd according to Kinematograph Weekly.  Critical In the New York Times , Bosley Crowther wrote the script was an intelligent treatment of "the simple and leisurely story" and the leading actors "excellent as the principals, who find that love, like devastated London, can be rebuilt". He wrote that Korda's direction "tells an oft-told tale but tells it easily and well".  Awards and honors Clemence Dane won an Academy Award for Best Original Motion Picture Story for Perfect Strangers.  References Additional sources Vermilye, Jerry.

On Ugliness (Italian: Storia della bruttezza) is a 2007 essay edited by Italian author Umberto Eco, originally published by Bompiani in 2007. The book is a continuation of Eco's 2004 aesthetic work On Beauty: A History of a Western Idea. Like the previous work, this essay combines literary excerpts and illustrations of artworks from ancient times to the present to define the concept of what it means to be ugly. "Ugliness is more fun than beauty", said Eco himself and some other reviews.  Synopsis Eco begins with an introduction trying to define the idea of ugliness, to verify that it is a polysemic concept, and that is associated with emotional expressions such as rejection or disgust which impede a rational approach. The first chapter approaches the Greek conception of beauty, trying to discern by opposition what is ugly, and ugliness is associated with the lack of harmony according to ancient Greeks. Ugliness is not only in the physical but also in the moral sense, Christianity denies to some extent the existence of ugliness, since the whole universe is a divine work and God can not create something ugly if He is a perfect being. Only sin and suffering are ugly because they move away from the precepts of faith. That is why everything monstrous or disgusting links to hell, the art of death and demon exaggerates the horrific features of this sphere to instill the fear of the believers, to prevent them from being tempted. A second topic begins in chapter 5, with the association between ugly and obscenity, and also absurdity, which can make people laugh. Humour thus indicates the aesthetic measure, as seen in the costumbrist descriptions or the art of caricature, where women and enemies are easy targets of jokes about ugliness. In the present day, new aesthetic categories are added to the traditional dichotomy between beauty and ugliness, such as kitsch and camp. The book ends with a review of the current polysemy of ugliness, in line with postmodern relativism.  Contents Reception The Independent: "Though sales of this anthology of the repellent and weird are unlikely to match those of Eco's On Beauty, published two years ago, this is by far the more interesting. […] this book is full of amazements." New York Public Library: "On Ugliness is an extraordinary road map to the perception of the grotesque over the centuries."   == References ==

Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop is a historic structure at the corner of Bourbon Street and St. Philip Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. Most likely built as a house in the 1770s during the Spanish colonial period, it is one of the oldest surviving structures in New Orleans. According to legend, the privateer Jean Lafitte, aka John Lafitte, owned a business here in the early 19th century. As with many things involving the Lafittes, including the possibility that they used the structure to plot illegal seizures and the sale of contraband, no documentation exists (it was only after the Lafitte brothers were long gone that Jean's signature was found on a document, finally ascertaining how their family name was spelled: LAFFITE). It is purported to be one of the more haunted venues in the French Quarter. The name Blacksmith Shop may not be coincidental. Lafitte's associates may have operated a smithy here during the days of reliance upon horses, who had to be shod. Jean's older brother Pierre Lafitte was a blacksmith, and their associate Renato Beluche may have once owned this building. The current business traces its roots to Roger 'Tom' Caplinger, who in the mid-1940s turned the old abandoned shop into Café Lafitte. The cafe became a popular night spot that attracted a bohemian clientele, including the gay community and celebrities like Noël Coward and Tennessee Williams. However, Caplinger never held clear title to the property and the building was sold in 1953. He soon opened a second cafe at the other end of the same block named Café Lafitte in Exile, which maintains that it is the oldest gay bar in the U.S. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970. It is a rare extant example of briquette-entre-poteaux construction.  In fiction Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop is featured in the historical novel Anthony Adverse by Hervey Allen. As depicted in the novel, the "blacksmith shop" was mainly a cover for maintaining a gang of exceptionally tall and strong black slaves – who were ostensibly engaged in shoeing horses while being used by the Lafitte brothers for intimidation, extortion and other criminal activities in and around New Orleans.

Archibald "Archie" Andrews, created in 1941 by publisher John L. Goldwater and artist Bob Montana in collaboration with writer Vic Bloom, is the main character in the Archie Comics franchise, including the long-running Archie Andrews radio series, a syndicated comic strip, The Archie Show, Archie's Weird Mysteries, and Riverdale. With the creation of Archie Andrews, publisher John Goldwater hoped to appeal to fans of the Andy Hardy films starring Mickey Rooney. Archie Andrews is the rhythm guitarist and one of the three singers of the fictional band The Archies. He is portrayed by KJ Apa on Riverdale and Agastya Nanda in The Archies. For his physical appearance, he has red hair, freckles on his cheeks, and light-colored skin. In Archie's Weird Mysteries, he appears to be of Scottish-American descent, as shown in the episode "The Day the Earth Moved", when his father wanted to keep with their family tradition and wear a kilt while ringing the bell of Riverdale.  Fictional character biography Archie Andrews debuted in Pep Comics #22 (cover-dated Dec. 1941). He is the only child of Mary and Fred Andrews. His father works as a mid-level business executive. His mother, initially a homemaker, takes a job at a real estate agency in later years. His earlier life is revealed in the "Little Archie" stories when he had a dog named Spotty. Archie lives in Riverdale, where he attends Riverdale High School. Archie is a typical small-town teenager. He is extremely clumsy and can be very stupid. His main crush is Veronica Lodge, but he is also fond of Betty Cooper, forming the love triangle driving many of the comic's plot lines. He has the best intentions, but often comes into conflict with Veronica's rich father, Hiram Lodge, and Riverdale High's principal, Waldo Weatherbee. As one of the three vocalists and the rhythm guitarist of The Archies, Archie performs with Betty and Veronica, as well as his nemesis Reggie Mantle, who battles him for Veronica and Betty’s heart, and his best friend Jughead Jones. Mary and Fred Andrews are of Scottish descent. Archie's paternal grandfather, Andy Andrews, immigrated to the United States from Scotland and befriended Moose Mason's Russian ancestor, who had emigrated at the same time. Archie has been depicted wearing the traditional kilt of his ancestors and playing bagpipes (but not very well). The Little Archie series, published from 1956 through the mid-1990s, chronicles the adventures of pre-teen Archie and his friends while in elementary school. The 2010 revival of the Life with Archie series chronicles two alternate, parallel story lines, with Archie marrying Veronica in one and Betty the other. He has orange hair, a face with a set of three freckles on each cheek, and light skin.  Relationships Love life Archie and Betty have been best friends and love interests all their lives. When Veronica Lodge moved to Riverdale, however, he switched his attention to her, making Betty both angry and jealous. She began competing with Veronica for his affection. In the comics, he sometimes thinks of Betty more as a close friend and confidante. He likes that she is always available as a back-up when he does not have a date with Veronica. He dislikes it when Betty dates other boys, wanting her to stay available as his second choice. Now that Betty sporadically dates Jason Blossom and Adam Chisholm, Archie shows a tinge of jealousy. Archie is married to Betty in Archie Marries Betty: Life With Archie series and is married to Veronica in Archie Marries Veronica: Life with Archie series. Both scenarios produce different outcomes for Archie's overall life, as well as Betty's and Veronica's. Archie often competes for the attention of Betty and Veronica with his rival, Reggie Mantle, and occasionally other boys. Veronica keeps Archie guessing, never letting him take her for granted. Betty, on the other hand, clearly lets Archie know she adores him. Archie chooses to keep fighting for Veronica. A third love interest is a wealthy red-headed girl named Cheryl Blossom. At first, she was deemed too sexual and a bit promiscuous and was taken out of the series, but due to her popularity, she was brought back in Love Showdown, a four-part mini-series in which Archie attempts to make a decision between Cheryl, Betty, and Veronica. On May 15, 2009, Archie Comics announced that Archie would finally pick one of the girls to marry, in a story arc in Archie #600–606 (Aug. 2009 – Feb. 2010). However, Archie Comics publicly revealed this to be a dream sequence to show two possible futures: one where Archie marries Veronica (issues 600–602), and the other Betty (603–605). In both, he has twins: a boy also named Archie who looks like him, and a girl named after and resembling whichever girl he married. Issue 606 was an epilogue to Archie Marries Veronica/Archie Marries Betty that returns to the comics' old format. In Archie No. 608 (May 2010), Archie began a relationship with Valerie Brown, making her Archie's first girlfriend of African descent. The Archies and Josie and the Pussycats were touring together and, while rehearsing, Archie and Valerie secretly fell in love as they co-wrote the song "More Than Words" that described their feelings. Issue No. 609 revealed that this relationship had seeped into common knowledge by the end of the tour. Archie and Valerie were forced apart when the Pussycats were touring Europe without the Archies, but hoped to keep their relationship going. In the comic Archie Marries Valerie, Valerie is expecting a baby with Archie, whom they name Star. In Archie No. 700 (July 2019), which signifies the start of another soft reboot, it is revealed that Archie got into a relationship with Sabrina Spellman over his summer break while everyone was on vacation after she had saved him from a pack of wolves.  Friends Jughead Jones has been Archie's best friend ever since childhood. When Jughead first came to Riverdale, he was in a bad mood and tended to dismiss Archie. However, Archie, of good heart, tried to cheer up Jughead and the two have been inseparable ever since. Jughead wears a trademark clubhouse beanie (a Depression-era style of makeshift hatwear, crafted from an inverted fedora with a scallop-cut brim, and decorated with assorted pinbacks) and an inscrutable, closed-eyelid expression. Often Jughead has to help Archie out from a tricky situation. Jughead usually knows when Archie's ideas will not work, but is powerless to avoid getting involved. Reggie Mantle is Archie's constant romantic and athletic rival. Each often makes attempts to separate the other from Veronica, occasionally exhibiting physical violence, and both have won their fair share of scrapes with each other. Reggie takes every opportunity to play practical jokes on Archie and make cynical wisecracks. However, Reggie is often shown as a companion to and of Archie despite his arrogance and competitive nature, and they are often seen together practicing athletics or pursuing dates. Archie's other friends include Dilton Doiley, the local genius who gets Archie into and out of trouble through his experiments and inventions; Moose Mason, the dim-witted but likable star athlete of Riverdale High who is often Archie's teammate; Chuck Clayton, another of Archie's teammates who was originally shy and reclusive but came out of his shell when Archie befriended him; Moose and Chuck's girlfriends Midge Klump and Nancy Woods, two of the very few attractive girls Archie does not fall for; and Ethel Muggs, a girl with an enormous crush on Jughead, who often wins his heart with the use of fresh-baked cookies.  Interests Sports Outside of dating, Archie largely enjoys sports. He plays baseball, basketball, and football for the Riverdale High teams. Though often not as good an athlete as Moose Mason, Chuck Clayton or Reggie Mantle, he proves a valuable member of the school team. Coaches Kleats and Clayton value him for both his athletic abilities and his team spirit. However, Archie's athletic abilities vary from story to story, due to his frequent clumsiness. He also has a tendency to pay more attention to cheerleaders than to his playing. For this reason, Coach Kleats often tries to avoid resorting to use Archie in a game.  Cars Automobiles are one of Archie's hobbies, and he is passionate about his car. For decades, he was shown driving a 1916 Ford Model T jalopy called "Betsy". In Archie double digest No. 192, it is said to be a Model A. In a story during which Archie tried to have his jalopy insured, he described it as being a "Ford, Chevy, Plymouth, Pierce-Arrow, Packard, DeSoto, Hudson ..." explaining that his jalopy was "a collection of replacement parts from several junkyards", some of which dated back to 1926. Archie's jalopy was destroyed permanently in issue No. 238 of Life With Archie, which was published in 1983. In the newer comics, he drives a mid-1960s' Ford Mustang, which is more contemporary in appearance, but still unreliable and prone to breakdowns. Archie Digest 239, published in October 2007, included a new story in which the one and only Mr. Lodge owned an antique car that had a strong resemblance to Archie's jalopy. The story featured Archie's grandfather who, as a teenager, looked and dressed like Archie from the 1940s. It turned out that he owned the same jalopy that Mr. Lodge now owned.  The Archies The Archies is a garage band containing Archie (vocals and rhythm guitar), Reggie (bass), Veronica (vocals and keyboards), Betty (vocals, lead guitar and percussion), and Jughead (drums). Archie founded the group himself. Although not as famous as Josie and the Pussycats, the band plays numerous gigs and has some notoriety. In the Little Archies series, the band just starts to form, although Archie, Betty, Jughead, Reggie, and Veronica start to play different kind of songs.  Death In April 2014, 72 years after the character's first appearance, Archie Comics announced that the adult Archie would die in the July 2014 issue (#36) of Life with Archie, while the teenage Archie would continue in the other Archie comic series titles. Archie dies when he is shot in the abdomen while saving his friend, Senator Kevin Keller. The story is written so as to terminate both storylines, without committing to which girl Archie married, and contains several flashbacks to the Little Archie days. The final issue (#37) is set one year after Archie's death. All his friends memorialize him, and Riverdale High School is officially renamed Archie Andrews High School in his honor. The story ends with Jughead, owner of Juggie's (formerly Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe), serving a sundae to three children who resemble Little Archie, Betty, and Veronica.  In other media Radio Montana's characters were heard on radio in the early 1940s. Archie Andrews began on the NBC Blue Network on May 31, 1943, switched to Mutual in 1944, and then continued on NBC radio from 1945 until September 5, 1953.

Queensland Ballet, founded in 1960 by Charles Lisner, is the premier ballet company of Queensland, Australia, and is based in Brisbane. It is one of only three full-time, professional classical ballet companies in Australia. The company has had six previous Artistic Directors, and is currently led by Leanne Benjamin.  In 2023, the company consists of 60 dancers, including 12 Jette Parker Young Artists.  History Charles Lisner (1960–1974) Queensland Ballet’s founding Artistic Director, Charles Lisner, trained with Edouard Borovansky and danced with the Borovansky Australian Ballet prior to traveling to London to continue his dance studies with the Sadlers Wells Ballet School. He later joined The Royal Ballet, Convent Garden. In 1953, Charles returned to Australia to open the Lisner Ballet Academy, which became the Lisner Ballet Company in 1960. The company was re-named Queensland Ballet in 1962 and became one of the first ballet ensembles in Australia to tour regionally, a commitment that continues today.  Harry Haythorne (1974–1978) Lisner stepped down as Artistic Director in 1974 and was replaced by Harry Haythorne, who was previously Assistant Director of the Scottish ballet. During his tenure, Haythorne presented works by Australian choreographers including Graeme Murphy, Garth Welch, and Don Asker, and had Hans Brenaa stage La Sylphide and other Bournonville ballets. His contract with the company ended in 1978.  Harold Collins (1978–1997) A former Principal Dancer of Queensland Ballet, Harold Collins was appointed Artistic Director in 1978, and led the company until his retirement in 1997. During that time, he presented memorable productions, among them Jacqui Carroll's Scheherazade and Carmina Burana and Collin's Salome, Carmen and Romeo & Juliet. Following Lisner's vision, Collins continued to commission new Australian works in contemporary and classical styles, and forged the enduring relationship between Queensland Ballet and the Queensland Dance School of Excellence.  François Klaus (1998–2012) François Klaus was appointed Artistic Director and Chief Choreographer of Queensland Ballet in 1988. Over fifteen years, Klaus contributed nearly 100 new ballet works to the company's repertoire, from new productions of classic ballets to works designed especially to appeal to families. Included in his repertoire is the immensely popular Cloudland, a tribute to Brisbane's post-war era set in the once famous Cloudland Ballroom. Under his directorship, Queensland Ballet undertook three tours to Europe (2006, 2007, and 2009), to great public an critical acclaim. The company also toured to Singapore in March 2007, Japan in 2009, and China in 2011 to perform Alice in Wonderland and The Little Mermaid. During his tenure, Klaus also established training programs which are now an integral part of the company's operations, providing pathways for talented young people who are committed to a career in dance.  Li Cunxin (2013–2023) In 2012, Li Cunxin, acclaimed former dancer and author of the best-selling autobiography, Mao's Last Dancer, was appointed as the new Artistic Director. Having no desire to choreograph himself, Li became the first curatorial director in the company's history. Li has been recognised for his dedication and commitment to growing the size and calibre of the company, having programmed adventurous works into their repertoire, incorporated additional international tours, and founding the development of the Queensland Ballet Academy and Thomas Dixon Centre. In August 2015, the company performed Peter Schaufuss' La Sylphide at the London Coliseum. In November 2018, they embarked on a China tour, performing Liam Scarlett's A Midsummer Night's Dream to audiences in Shanghai, Suzhou, Beijing, and Xi'an. Li retired for health reasons at the end of 2023.  Leanne Benjamin (2024–present) Rockhampton-born former principal dancer with The Royal Ballet, Leanne Benjamin was appointed Artistic Director in 2024.  Performances Queensland Ballet averages six main-stage productions per season, in addition to smaller, more intimate performances and regional tours. They have performed Ben Stevenson OBE’s The Nutcracker annually since 2013. The company regularly performs at Queensland Performing Arts Centre (QPAC) as well as in the Talbot Theatre at the Thomas Dixon Centre.

Holland House is a Georgian country house, in Kingsgate, Kent in England. It was built between 1762 and 1768 by the politician Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland (1705–1774), of Holland House in Kensington, as his retirement home. It is a Grade II listed building.  Location and construction The house overlooks the sea at Kingsgate Bay. It was designed by the amateur architect Thomas Wynn, 1st Baron Newborough and said to have been inspired by Cicero's villa at Formiae on the coast of Baiae. The architect Robert Adam was commissioned by Holland to design the interiors, but the work was not completed.. Holland built a number of follies, constructed using flint, in the environs of Holland House, which included:  Kingsgate Castle, originally intended as stables; later rebuilt by John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury (1834–1913) as his family home The King's Gate, a mock defensive Gothic crenellated gateway with portcullis, built on the beach in a gap between the cliffs, with stairs leading up to the house. Originally named Bartholomew Gate, it was later renamed to the King's Gate to commemorate King Charles II's ship reputedly having had a forced landing there during a storm in 1683. It is now located in the grounds of Kingsgate Castle Arx Ruochim, a coastal fort above White Ness, built in the style of several erected by King Henry VIII and said to have replaced a fort built on the site by King Vortigern in 458 AD; it survives, but missing its tower Hackendown Tower, built by Lord Holland on a Saxon burial mound which he had excavated in 1765, which he supposed to mark the site of a battle between the Saxons and the Danes, the name of which is apparently a play on "hack 'em down" Countess Fort, possibly used as an ice house The Captain Digby public house, named after Lord Holland’s nephew Admiral Robert Digby Whitfield Tower, built by Lord Holland on the highest point in the locality, in memory of Robert Whitfield, from whom he purchased much of the estate. Holland and his family used the estate for the shooting of partridges and the playing of cricket, and in 1767 Holland increased his land holdings by purchasing the nearby estate of Quex.  Subsequent ownership Following Holland's death his estates were inherited by his second surviving son, the Whig statesman Charles James Fox. Fox sold the estate, together with Quex, to John Powell (d.1783) of Birchington. Powell died without progeny, and his estates passed to his sister. Her eldest son Arthur Annesley Powell inherited the estate, which by that point had fallen into ruin. When he died in 1813 the estate passed to his younger brother John Powell Roberts (1769–1849). It was subsequently acquired by the banker and archaeologist John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury (1834–1913), who rebuilt the house from its degraded condition and expanded it. The house's surviving façade dates from a remodelling circa 1850, during which the original central portico was removed to the Royal Sea Bathing Hospital at Margate. Its next owner was the businessman and railway executive Charles Lawrence (1855–1927), who in 1923 was elevated to the peerage as Baron Lawrence of Kingsgate. The surviving parts of the original structure are known today as Old Holland House. In the 1990s the entire building was converted into flats.  Notes   == References ==

Brian Palmes (before 1467–1519) was an English landowner, justice of the assize and politician who sat in the House of Commons.  Early life Palmes was the son eldest son and heir of William Palmes of Naburn and Eleanor, daughter of William Heslerton of Heslerton. He was a member of the Palmes family, an ancient upper-gentry family that had been seated at Naburn Hall since the 13th century. In about 1480 he and his younger brother Guy entered the Middle Temple, where both were to do well. In 1496 he became recorder of York in succession to Sir William Fairfax, and in the following year was made a Freeman; he proved more diligent in attending the York council than some recorders, twice supervising elections when a mayor died in office. It was a measure of the city’s satisfaction that in 1504 it appointed his brother, who was already a sergeant, to be "of counsel" at 20s. a year. His and his first wife’s membership of the city’s Corpus Christi guild, and his own of the merchants’ guild, suggest that he engaged in trade. When in December 1509 Palmes was elected to Parliament he at once resigned the recordership. The city rarely elected its recorder and the choice of Palmes may have been influenced by his recent despatch to London with two aldermen, one of them his fellow-Member William Nelson, on unspecified business. Unlike Nelson, he was not to be re-elected, perhaps because he was made a sergeant in 1510, but his continued standing in the city and shire is reflected in his appointment to nine subsidy commissions between 1512 and 1515. Little of a personal nature has come to light about his later years. In 1515 he presented his son George (later Wolsey’s confessor and a canon of York) to the living of Sutton-upon-Derwent, Yorkshire, and in the following year he was named executor by his brother.  Family Palmes married first Anastasia or Eustachia, whose surname is unknown. His second wife was Ellen Acclome, the daughter of John Acclome of Moreby Hall, Yorkshire. His third wife was Anne Markenfield Conyers, daughter of Sir Thomas Markenfield of Markenfield Hall and widow of Christopher Conyers of Sockburn, county  Durham. Palmes was the father of five children from his second marriage:  Nicholas Palmes (d. 1551), succeeded his father to Naburn Hall. He married his cousin Johana, daughter of William Conyers of Sockburn Hall, who was the mother of his eldest son and heir, Brian. He married secondly Susan, daughter of Sir Robert Waterton of Walton Hall, West Yorkshire. George Palmes, died unmarried William Palmes, died unmarried Richard Palmes, died unmarried Agnes Palmes, married in 1559 Sir William Babthorpe of Babthorpe and Osgodby. They were the parents of two children.  Marston Moor signet ring Palmes' portrait depicts him wearing a signet ring on his index finger; this ring was lost by his descendant in the Battle of Marston Moor and it was found during the 1860s when a farmer was ploughing the battle site.  Death In his own will of 31 October 1519 Palmes asked to be buried in his parish church of St. George, York, whither his body was to be escorted by friars from the four York houses and by members of the Corpus Christi guild, and to have prayers said for him and his family locally for seven years and at Roecliffe for ever. He made numerous bequests of lands and goods to his family, and named as executors and residuary legatees his wife, Sir William Bulmer and Sir Guy Dawny, Thomas Langton and James Duffelde, gentlemen, Richard Ellis, clerk, and William Marshall.

Cancer slope factors (CSF) are used to estimate the risk of cancer associated with exposure to a carcinogenic or potentially carcinogenic substance. A slope factor is an upper bound, approximating a 95% confidence limit, on the increased cancer risk from a lifetime exposure to an agent by ingestion or inhalation. This estimate, usually expressed in units of proportion (of a population) affected per mg of substance/kg body weight-day, is generally reserved for use in the low-dose region of the dose-response relationship, that is, for exposures corresponding to risks less than 1 in 100. Slope factors are also referred to as cancer potency factors (PF).  Toxicity Assessments for Carcinogenic Effects For carcinogens, it is commonly assumed that a small number of molecular events may evoke changes in a single cell that can lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation and eventually to a clinical diagnosis of cancer.  This toxicity of carcinogens is referred to as being "non-threshold" because there is believed to be essentially no level of exposure that does not pose some probability of producing a carcinogenic response, therefore, there is no dose that can be considered to be risk-free. However, some (non-genotoxic) carcinogens may exhibit a threshold whereby doses lower than the threshold do not invoke a carcinogenic response. When evaluating cancer risks of genotoxic carcinogens, theoretically an effect threshold cannot be estimated.  For chemicals that are carcinogens, a two-part evaluation to quantify risk is often employed in which the substance first is assigned a weight-of-evidence classification, and then a slope factor is calculated.  Generating a Slope Factor When the chemical is a known or probable human carcinogen, a toxicity value that defines quantitatively the relationship between dose and response (i.e., the slope factor) is calculated.  Because risk at low exposure levels is difficult to measure directly either by animal experiments or by epidemiologic studies, the development of a slope factor generally entails applying a model to the available data set and using the model to extrapolate from the relatively high doses administered to experimental animals (or the exposures noted in epidemiologic studies) to the lower exposure levels expected for human contact in the environment.  Data Sets High-quality human data (e.g. high quality epidemiological studies) on carcinogens are preferable to animal data. When human data are limited, the most sensitive species is given the greatest emphasis.  Occasionally, in situations where no single study is judged most appropriate, yet several studies collectively support the estimate, the geometric mean of estimates from all studies may be adopted as the slope.  This practice ensures the inclusion of all relevant data.  Weight-of-Evidence Classification for Carcinogens Slope factors are typically calculated for potential carcinogens in classes A, B1, and B2.  Quantitative estimation of slope factors for the chemicals in class C proceeds on a case-by-case basis. The slope factor is used in risk assessments to estimate an upper-bound lifetime probability of an individual developing cancer as a result of exposure to a   particular level of a potential carcinogen.  Slope  factors should always be accompanied by the weight of-evidence classification to indicate the strength of the evidence that the agent is a human carcinogen.  A = Human carcinogen B1 = indicates that limited human data are available. B2 = indicates sufficient evidence in animals and inadequate or no evidence in humans. C = Possible human carcinogen D = Not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity E = Evidence of non-carcinogenicity for humans  Calculation of Cancer Risk For each age interval "i", the cancer risk for exposure by a specified pathway is computed as:                                                 Risk                                   i                             =         C         ⋅                                                I                                R                                    i                                               ⋅               E                                F                                    i                                               ⋅               E                                D                                    i                                                                         B                                W                                    i                                               ⋅               A               T                                          ⋅         S         F         ⋅         A         D         A                    F                        i                                     {\displaystyle {\text{Risk}}_{i}=C\cdot {\frac {IR_{i}\cdot EF_{i}\cdot ED_{i}}{BW_{i}\cdot AT}}\cdot SF\cdot ADAF_{i}}     Where:  C = Concentration of the chemical in the contaminated environmental medium (soil or water) to which the person is exposed. The units are mg/kg for soil and mg/L for water. IRi = Intake rate of the contaminated environmental medium for age bin "i". The units are kg/day for soil and L/day for water. BWi = Body weight of the exposed person for age bin "i". EFi = Exposure frequency for age bin "i" (days/year). This describes how often a person is exposed to the contaminated medium over the course of a typical year. EDi = Exposure duration for age bin "i" (years). This describes how long a person is exposed to the contaminated medium over the course of their lifetime. AT = Averaged time, in days. This term specifies the length of time over which the average dose is calculated. For quantifying cancer risk a "lifetime" of 70 years is used (i.e, 70 years times 365 days/year). SF = Cancer slope factor (mg/kg-day)−1 ADAF = Age-dependent adjustment factor for age bin "i" (unitless)  Risk Specific Dose (RSD) The Cancer Slope Factor is used to derive the Risk Specific Dose (RSD)(mg/kg-day) for direct-acting carcinogenic agents, those that cause chemical changes (mutations) in DNA.  It is also the default choice for carcinogens when there are insufficient data to demonstrate that the mode of action of the chemical is nonlinear.  The RSD is often calculated based on a one-in-a-million extra risk (10−6 risk) or a one-in-a-hundred-thousand risk (10−5 risk) for other-than highly exposed individuals.  The term "extra" in the definition of the RSD refers to a risk from environmental exposure to the chemical of interest above the background risk that is always present. The formula to calculate the RSD for a chemical based on a one-in-a-million extra risk (10−6 risk) is:  RSD = 0.000001 / CSF  Potency Factor The CSF is also called a "potency factor" and is used to calculate the Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk by multiplying the CSF by the chronic daily intake (CDI).  The CDI is the dose over a lifetime and is expressed in mg/kg-day. (see also Risk Equations and Formulas Calculator)   == References ==

State of Swat (Urdu: رياست سوات), (Pashto: حکومت خداداد یوسفزئی و متعلقات) was a state established in 1849 by the Muslim saint Saidu Baba, also known as Akhund of Swat, and was ruled by Walis of Swat. It was recognized as a princely state in alliance with the British Raj between 1918 and 1947, after which the Akhwand acceded to the newly independent state of Pakistan. Swat continued to exist as an autonomous region until it was dissolved in 1969, and incorporated into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (formerly North-West Frontier Province). The area it covered is now divided among the present-day districts of Swat, Buner and Shangla.  History The Swat state was established by a religious leader, Saidu Baba, who was born in Swat Valley in 1794.  He began his life as a shepherd and then left the village at the age of 18 to settled in the village of Mian Brangola, where he got his early education and learnt the fundamentals of Islam.  Saidu Baba ultimately settled in 1849 at Saidu Sharif, gradually turning Swat into an independent state.: 40  However, after his death in 1877, Swat fell into abeyance till 1915, when Abdul Jabbar, a descendant of Pir Baba was elected as leader. In 1918, the grandson of Saidu Baba, Miangul Abdul Wadud became the Wali of Swat. Soon Swat was recognized by the British government as a princely state. In 1947, Miangul Abdul Wadud acceded his state to Pakistan.  Government The rulers of Swat held the title Amir-e Shariyat and from 1918 were known as Badshah; the title changed to Wali in 1926 when it became a Princely State of the British Raj. Since 1969 the former princely state has been under a civil administration as part of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Hubert Hurkacz (Polish pronunciation: [ˈxubɛrt ˈxurkatʂ]; born 11 February 1997) is a Polish professional tennis player. He has been ranked as high as world No. 7 in singles by the ATP, making him the highest-ranked Polish man in singles history. He has won eight ATP Tour singles titles, including two Masters 1000 titles at the 2021 Miami Open and the 2023 Shanghai Masters, becoming the first Pole to win an ATP Masters 1000 title. Hurkacz also has a career-high ranking of world No. 30 in doubles, which he attained in June 2022. As a junior, Hurkacz was ranked as high as No. 29 in the world. He and his partner Alex Molčan were the runners-up at the 2015 Australian Open boys' doubles final. As a professional, he broke into the top 100 for the first time in 2018 after reaching the second rounds of the 2018 French Open and 2018 US Open. That year, he qualified for the Next Generation ATP Finals, where he won against Jaume Munar, but lost to Frances Tiafoe and Stefanos Tsitsipas. In 2019, he won his first ATP title at the 2019 Winston-Salem Open. The next year, he defeated three higher-ranked opponents at the 2020 ATP Cup and reached the semifinals of the 2020 ATP Auckland Open. In doing so, he entered the top 30 of the world rankings. In 2021, after winning his second and third singles titles, he went on to reach his first Grand Slam semifinal at the 2021 Wimbledon Championships and became the second Polish man to make a semifinals appearance at a Grand Slam after Jerzy Janowicz in 2013. Hurkacz is an all-court player. At 1.96 m (6 ft 5 in), he also possesses a serve reaching up to 151 miles per hour (243 km/h) to set up effective one-two punches. In addition to being a defensive baseliner, he has often included netplay into his style and has been recognized for his penchant for playing serve-and-volley to close points.  Early life and background Hurkacz was born on 11 February 1997 to Zofia Maliszewska-Hurkacz and Krzysztof Hurkacz in Wrocław, Poland, as the first of two children. His younger sister, Nika, is ten years younger and also plays tennis. Hurkacz grew up in a family with athletic prowess. His mother was a junior tennis champion in Poland, and one of his uncles, Tomasz Maliszewski, played tennis professionally. His grandfather was also a volleyball player at an international level. When asked whether his family's history shaped him to become the athlete he became, Hurkacz replied, "The [sporting] genes, the motivation in the family, the love for the sport. I think they have helped me a lot." Hurkacz began playing tennis at the age of five after his mother introduced him to the sport as she practiced. His mother and father were his first teachers but he later enrolled in classes and started playing more consistently. He later became interested in professional tennis after watching Roger Federer on television. He has stated that if tennis was not his future, he would have pursued either basketball or motor racing, or he would continue his education. By 2014, Hurkacz had established himself as a member of the group of the most talented young Polish tennis players at the time, alongside Kamil Majchrzak and Jan Zieliński.  Career 2018: First Grand Slam wins and Next Generation ATP Finals Hurkacz played in the main draw at the French Open and defeated Tennys Sandgren in the first round. This marked his first victory at a Grand Slam and at any ATP main-draw event. He lost in the second round to third seed Marin Čilić in four sets. In August, Hurkacz made his US Open debut. He began as the sixth seed in the qualifying draw and reached his third consecutive Grand Slam main draw as a qualifier, beating John-Patrick Smith, Egor Gerasimov and Pedro Martínez Portero (all in straight sets) to enter into the first round. There, he faced Stefano Travaglia who, like many others, fell victim to the extreme heat and retired. In the second round, Hurkacz lost to 2014 US Open champion Čilić in their second meeting. In November, Hurkacz played at the NextGen Finals in Milan where he defeated Jaume Munar but lost to Frances Tiafoe and Stefanos Tsitsipas. At the end of the season he received a nomination for the ATP Newcomer of the Year Award.  2019: First ATP title and top 40 debut Hurkacz started his season at the Maharashtra Open in Pune, India. He continued at the Canberra Challenger, where he won the title after defeating Ilya Ivashka in the final. Hurkacz followed that up by making his debut at the Australian Open. He faced one of the best servers on the Tour, drawing Ivo Karlović in the opening round at Melbourne Park. After winning the first set, Hurkacz lost the match in four sets, all of which were tiebreakers. At the Dubai Championships, he defeated Corentin Moutet in the first round and then went on to win against No. 1 seeded player, Kei Nishikori, which marked his first ever win against a top 10 player. Hurkacz lost in the quarterfinals in three sets to the eventual runner-up of the tournament, Stefanos Tsitsipas. In March, Hurkacz played at the Indian Wells Open, where he made it to the quarterfinals of an ATP Masters 1000 event for the first time in his career. On his way to the quarterfinals, he defeated Kei Nishikori in the third round and Denis Shapovalov in the fourth round. In the quarterfinals, he lost to Roger Federer.

He then defeated Steve Johnson in the second round. In the quarterfinals Hurkacz lost a tight match against the eventual champion Taylor Fritz. For the first time in his career, Hurkacz reached the third round of a Grand Slam. At Wimbledon, he defeated Dušan Lajović and Leonardo Mayer to set up a third-round match with world No. 1 Djokovic. For two sets, Hurkacz gave Djokovic all he could handle before eventually succumbing to the top seed in four sets. At the Rogers Cup, Hurkacz defeated Taylor Fritz and Stefanos Tsitsipas before losing his third-round match to Gaël Monfils. Two weeks later, Hurkacz defeated Benoît Paire to win his first ATP title in Winston-Salem. In October, Hurkacz prevailed over Monfils in straight sets in the second round of the Shanghai Masters. In the third round he lost to Stefanos Tsitsipas.  2020: First Masters doubles title and top 30 debut At the 2020 ATP Cup, Hurkacz defeated a trio of higher-ranked opponents: Dominic Thiem, Diego Schwartzman and Borna Ćorić. Sixth seed, Hurkacz picked up where he left off at the ATP Cup, advancing to the semifinal of the ATP Auckland Open with victories over Lorenzo Sonego, Mikael Ymer, and Feliciano López. Seeded No. 31 at the Australian Open, Hurkacz reached the second round, defeating Dennis Novak before falling to John Millman in straight sets. With this successful run he reached the top 30 at world No. 28, on 3 February 2020. Playing at the Rotterdam Open Hurkacz lost a three set 1st round match to Tsitsipas. He continued in doubles with Auger-Aliassime. To reach the quarterfinal, they defeated third seeds Nikola Mektić and Wesley Koolhof. At Dubai, Hurkacz lost to Alexander Bublik in the first round. After tennis stopped in March 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic, Hurkacz resumed training with his coach Craig Boynton at the Saddlebrook Academies in Florida. In May, Hurkacz played at the UTR Pro Match Series presented by Tennis Channel, a two-day round-robin tournament in West Palm Beach, Florida. Four top 60 ATP players including Hurkacz, Miomir Kecmanović, Reilly Opelka and Tommy Paul competed in the inaugural edition from 8–9 May 2020. In August, Hurkacz traveled to New York City for the Cincinnati Open. In the first round he lost to John Isner. He continued at the US Open, where he defeated Peter Gojowczyk in the first round. In the second round he lost to Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. Seeded fifth at the Austrian Open Kitzbühel, Hurkacz defeated João Sousa in the first round. At the Italian Open, he defeated 2020 US Open quarterfinalist Andrey Rublev before falling to eighth seed Diego Schwartzman in the third round. Hurkacz continued at the French Open where he was seeded at No. 29. In the first round he lost to Tennys Sandgren in five sets.

He defeated Denis Shapovalov, Milos Raonic, Tsitsipas, Rublev, and Jannik Sinner en route to his first Masters 1000 title and third ATP title overall. By lifting the title in Miami, he entered the top 20 for the first time and reached a career-high ranking of No. 16 on 5 April 2021. At the Halle Open he reached his second doubles final partnering again with Auger-Aliassime, but lost to third-seeded German Kevin Krawietz and Romanian Horia Tecău. As the 14th seed at Wimbledon, Hurkacz defeated Lorenzo Musetti, Marcos Giron and Alexander Bublik all in straight sets to reach the fourth round at a Grand Slam for the first time in his career. In the fourth round Hurkacz defeated second seed Daniil Medvedev, his third top-10 win of the year. He was the fifth Polish man to reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals. Hurkacz then defeated eight-time Wimbledon champion and sixth seed Roger Federer in the quarterfinals in three sets, in what would transpire to be the Swiss player's final professional singles match. With this victory, he became the first man since Mario Ančić in 2002 to defeat Federer in straight sets at Wimbledon. Hurkacz became only the second Polish man in history to reach the semifinals at a Grand Slam (after Jerzy Janowicz at Wimbledon in 2013). Hurkacz then lost to 7th-seed Matteo Berrettini in the semifinals. With this successful run he entered the top 15 in the rankings at World No. 11 on 12 July 2021. Following his Wimbledon run, Hurkacz attended the 2020 Summer Olympics and entered as the seventh seed. He defeated Luke Saville in the first round before falling in a stunning defeat to Liam Broady in a second round three-setter. For the year's US Open Series, Hurkacz embarked on his first tournament of the North American summer swing at the Canadian Open in Toronto, where the seventh seed defeated Nikoloz Basilashvili to reach the quarterfinals before he lost to top seed Daniil Medvedev in a tight three-set match involving two tiebreaks. The following week, ninth-seeded Hurkacz took on the Cincinnati Masters and defeated former world No. 1 Andy Murray in straight sets before losing to Pablo Carreño Busta in the third round in another hard-fought match with two tiebreak sets. The loss ended Hurkacz's 12-match win streak in the United States following his success at Delray Beach and Miami earlier in the year. In New York, Hurkacz embarked on the US Open as the 10th seed. He defeated Egor Gerasimov in the first round in straight sets before he was ousted by Andreas Seppi in a five-set second round match with a final set tiebreak. After his loss in New York, Hurkacz headed to the 2021 Moselle Open to play in both the singles and doubles tournaments. In the singles, he was drawn as the top seed.

In the final, he lost to the World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in two sets both of which ended in a tie-break.  Playing style Hurkacz plays an all-court game with an emphasis on defensive baseline play, and former top 10 player Wojciech Fibak stated that Hurkacz is "an excellent, versatile player who can attack, accelerate and defend". Hurkacz is a big hitter, given that he stands 196 cm (6’5"). He is an effective server, with a top serve capable of reaching 151 miles per hour (243 km/h), and can hit powerfully from both his forehand and backhand. But like many of the tour's more powerful players, consistency has been described as an issue. Hurkacz plays solidly from the back of the court. He plays a low, flat and dangerous ball, while holding the ball in court. Over the years, Hurkacz has also developed a reputation as a diver on court. Speaking of his unique moves, Hurkacz explains, "I always enjoy grass courts, when you play on the hardcourt or clay court it's probably better not to dive as when you're falling down from the dive you can scratch yourself, on the grass, it's pretty comfortable. Sometimes, trying to get to a ball which is pretty far away, you just have to do it." He has also been described as a serve-and-volley player, especially on grass courts. His coach, Craig Boynton, summarized Hurkacz's style by comparing it to that of Andy Murray: "I think if you look at him, people have said he kind of mirrors Andy Murray with a similar routine on returns, a little bit of a similar backhand. He's a little taller than Andy. Andy's movement was phenomenal. But Hubi's a very good athlete, too." Despite all tennis players being taught to keep their eye on the ball, Hurkacz does quite the opposite. In a 2019 interview with L'Équipe, he admitted, "I confess, it's true, I close my eyes when I hit the ball. In fact, I've probably always played like that, and it's been a while since I've been noticed."  Coaches In the early years (2010–2016), Hurkacz was coached by Filip Kańczuła. In 2017, he continued with Wrocław coaches Alexander Charpantidis and Paweł Stadniczenko, who shaped the tennis career of Michał Przysiężny, while Przemysław Piotrowicz was responsible for physical preparation. In 2018, "Hubi" decided to work with New Zealander Rene Moller, who appeared at his side during the Next Gen ATP Finals in Milan later that same year. Under his leadership, Hurkacz won the Challenger in Canberra and strengthened himself in the top 100. At the 2019 Indian Wells Open, Hurkacz began his coaching partnership with Craig Boynton, who had worked with players including Jim Courier, Mardy Fish, John Isner, Sam Querrey and Steve Johnson.  Endorsements Sports company Yonex is the primary brand sponsor of Hubert Hurkacz. He has a head-to-toe deal with the company. Hubert plays with Yonex using Percept 97 racquet, Pro Series bag, Eclipson5 tennis shoes, and apparel. He is also sponsored by Lotos, a Polish capital group investing in oil. During his matches Hurkacz wears the Lotos brand's logo on his shirts. At the beginning of 2022 Hurkacz started to wear the Gerald Charles GC sport watch collection during his matches. Hurkacz has turned his childhood love of sports cars into a partnership with U.K. based McLaren that has him driving McLaren vehicles while at tournaments. It started in New York City when Hurkacz toured around in the McLaren GT. At the 2021 BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells he was spinning in the McLaren 720S, the same car he drives when in Poland.  Personal life For the past several years Hurkacz has adhered to a vegan diet. However, during an interview with ATP, he stated that "when I was a kid, I didn’t like salad at all and I didn’t like most of the veggies".

"Dreams" is a song by the British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, written and sung by Stevie Nicks for the band's eleventh studio album, Rumours (1977). In the United States, "Dreams" was released as the second single from Rumours in March 1977, while in the United Kingdom, the song was released as the third single in June 1977. A stage performance of "Dreams" was used as the promotional music video. In the US, "Dreams" sold more than one million copies and reached the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100, the band's only number-one single in the country. In Canada, "Dreams" also reached number one on the RPM Top 100 Singles chart. In late 2020, the song experienced a widespread resurgence in popularity as a result of a viral TikTok video created by Nathan Apodaca. The song subsequently re-entered national music charts and also entered the Spotify and Apple Music charts in certain countries. "Dreams" was ranked number nine on Rolling Stone's 2021 list of the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".  Background and composition The members of Fleetwood Mac were experiencing emotional upheavals while recording the Rumours album. Mick Fleetwood was going through a divorce. Christine McVie and John McVie were separating, while Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were ending their eight-year relationship. "We had to go through this elaborate exercise of denial," explained Buckingham to Blender magazine, "keeping our personal feelings in one corner of the room while trying to be professional in the other."  Stevie Nicks wrote the song in early 1976 at Record Plant studio in Sausalito, California. "One day when I wasn't required in the main studio," remembers Nicks to Blender magazine, "I took a Fender Rhodes piano and went into another studio that was said to belong to Sly Stone, of Sly and the Family Stone. It was a black-and-red room, with a sunken pit in the middle where there was a piano, and a big black-velvet bed with Victorian drapes." "I sat down on the bed with my keyboard in front of me," continues Nicks. "I found a drum pattern, switched my little cassette player on and wrote 'Dreams' in about 10 minutes. Right away I liked the fact that I was doing something with a dance beat, because that made it a little unusual for me." When Nicks played the song to the rest of the group, "They weren't nuts about it. But I said 'Please! Please record this song, at least try it.' Because the way I play things sometimes... you really have to listen." The band recorded it the following day. Only a basic track was recorded at Sausalito, with Nicks playing the Rhodes piano and singing. Recording assistant Cris Morris remembers how "all (they) kept was the drum track and live vocal from Stevie – the guitars and bass were added later in Los Angeles." Christine McVie described the song as having "just three chords and one note in the left hand" and "boring" when Nicks played a rough version on the piano. McVie changed her mind after Buckingham "fashioned three sections out of identical chords, making each section sound completely different. He created the impression that there's a thread running through the whole thing."  Recording Producer Ken Caillat made an eight bar drum loop of Fleetwood's drumming to create "deep hypnotic effect". Caillat said of the loop that "It’s funny, but when people talk about the classic rhythm section of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie and they point to this one song, I’m always amused that they’re talking about a drum loop." The electric guitars were sent through four different signals: "a direct signal, a miked signal, a signal running from the output of the amp head, and another direct signal from a volume pedal". These signals were then panned in stereo, which in producer Richard Dashut's estimation, allowed for the guitars to move across the left and right channels "in a very majestic way". For the song's lead vocals, Caillat assembled a series of eight microphones organized and asked Nicks to sing into each one of them to decide which one she preferred. Nicks ultimately selected a Sennheiser 441 microphone, which according to Caillat was a relatively inexpensive microphone. "When she got to [that] one particular mic and sang into it, she said, "Oh my god, I love this mic! It sounds great!", and my job was done." Caillat placed a windscreen a half-inch away from the microphone and asked Nicks to sing against it so that the lower frequencies of her voice would be captured. The band decided that the pre-chorus needed more instrumentation, so Fleetwood added some tom-tom accents starting at the song's 48 second mark. Christine McVie originally played sparse whole notes on a piano during this section, but this was deemed unsuitable, so Dashut suggested the addition of a vibraphone instead, which was also played by McVie. Delay was applied to each vibraphone hit so that each note would repeat. For the backing vocals, Buckingham, McVie, and Nicks convened around a piano, with the former playing triads on the instrument to find the optimal harmonic blend. The three singers recorded their vocal harmonies and later doubled their parts. Fleetwood wanted to overdub some congas during the song's chorus, but the instrument was not readily available, so he waited until the next day to record them.  Reception Cash Box said that "a softly droning bass backs Stevie Nicks' alluring lead vocal" and "subdued in comparison to the previous 'Go Your Own Way' this record has its own subtly building intensity."  Record World said that "Stevie Nicks' vocal makes these dreams a melodic reality."  New York Times critic John Rockwell called the single a "classy record" and commenting on the appeal provided by Stevie Nicks' "strange, nasal yet husky soprano" and on Mick Fleetwood's "wonderfully crisp, exact drumming." The Guardian and Paste ranked the song number one and number four, respectively, on their lists of the 30 greatest Fleetwood Mac songs.  Chart performance and legacy In the United States, "Dreams" reached the number-one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on 18 June 1977, and held it for one week. On the Adult Contemporary chart, "Dreams" was Fleetwood Mac's highest-charting single during the 1970s where it reached number 11. In the UK Singles Chart, "Dreams" went to number 24, staying in the top 40 for eight weeks. Since its initial release, "Dreams" has re-entered the charts on various occasions. It picked up two additional weeks on the UK charts in 2011 following the airing of the Glee "Rumours" episode. In 2018, "Dreams" returned to the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart at number 14, re-popularized by a viral tweet. The song also returned to the New Zealand charts for one week in 2019 at number 40.  The song then re-entered the New Zealand charts on 5 October 2020 at number 28, and has since spent 71 consecutive weeks in the top 40, whilst also reaching a new peak of 3 consecutive weeks at number 6. The same year, it also entered the Irish charts for the first time. In October 2020, the song reached number one on the Billboard Rock Digital Song Sales chart as a result of a viral TikTok video of Nathan Apodaca lip syncing to the song while skateboarding down a highway in Idaho Falls, Idaho drinking Ocean Spray cran-raspberry juice. Following the popularity of the video, "Dreams" also placed among the Top 50 most-streamed songs on Spotify and Apple Music in the US, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, re-entering the ARIA in Australia (where it reached a new peak) and the UK Official Charts. "Dreams" also re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 21 on 17 October 2020, giving the band its highest placement on the Hot 100 since 20 February 1988, when "Everywhere" charted at number 17. “Dreams" then rose to number 12 the following week.  Personnel Stevie Nicks – lead vocals, backing vocals Christine McVie – Fender Rhodes electric piano, organ, vibraphone, backing vocals Lindsey Buckingham – electric and acoustic guitars, backing vocals Mick Fleetwood – drums, congas John McVie – bass guitar  Charts Certifications The Corrs version Irish band the Corrs originally recorded "Dreams" for Legacy: A Tribute to Fleetwood Mac's Rumours, the 20th anniversary album of cover versions which also featured "Don't Stop" by Elton John, "You Make Loving Fun" by Jewel and others from the Goo Goo Dolls and the Cranberries. The cover version was originally recorded similar to the original song until Oliver Leiber transformed the recording into a dance track mixed with a violin and tin whistle hook. It was then remixed by Todd Terry for single release and became the first big hit for the Corrs in the UK, reaching number six on the UK Singles Chart and staying on the chart for 10 weeks. The video also won the "Best Adult Contemporary Video" award from Billboard magazine in 1998. The Corrs' second studio album, Talk on Corners, was then re-released with "Dreams" added. The Corrs performed "Dreams" with Mick Fleetwood from Fleetwood Mac in their concert at the Royal Albert Hall on St. Patrick's Day, 1998 (which was also Caroline Corr's 25th birthday).  Critical reception Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, "The Corrs bring an interesting Celtic flavor to the first pop single from Legacy: A Tribute to Fleetwood Mac's Rumours. Although it's difficult to let go of the intense drama of the original recording, the act's earnest delivery is to be commended and appreciated. In an effort to better connect with the kids of crossover radio, club icon Todd Terry has been enlisted to remix the song with a more forceful disco sound. It was a wise move that gives this single a fighting chance in drawing the positive attention of the pop masses." Scottish Daily Record praised the cover version as "superb". Music Week felt the classic "is given an uplifting Celtic overhaul on this breezy, radio-friendly cover which has Andrea Corr's gorgeous vocal joined by violin and tin whistle. With airplay already building and the familiarity of the song, "Dreams" should see the quartet reaching even further than their ever-growing fanbase." An editor from Sunday Mirror stated that "Ireland's three most beautiful women and their brother should finally crack it over here with this Todd Terry remix."  Music video A music video was produced to accompany the song, directed by British music video director and editor Dani Jacobs. Shot in Singapore on April 10th, 1998 at the Thian Hock Keng Temple during the bands promotional tour of South Asia. It won the "Best Adult Contemporary Video" award from Billboard magazine in 1998. The video was made available on YouTube in 2009 and as of July 2022, it had generated more than 23 million views. The video for the Todd Terry Remix was made available on the platform in 2014.

An edited version of the song is included on Nicks' 2007 album Crystal Visions – The Very Best of Stevie Nicks.

Mick Fleetwood, Lindsey Buckingham, and Stevie Nicks released responses to Apodaca's video on TikTok, with Nicks donning a pair of roller skates while performing the song. Subsequently, Ocean Spray gave Nathan a brand new pickup truck after Ocean Spray received unexpected publicity when the video went viral.

Abbas Abdullahi Sheikh Siraji (Somali: Cabaas Cabdulaahi Sheekh Siraaji; Arabic: (عباس عبد الله شيخ سراج) born 8 May 1984 – 3 May 2017) was a Somali politician who briefly served as the Minister of Public Works and Reconstruction until he was shot dead in Mogadishu in 2017.  Personal life Born to a prestigious religious family of the Rahanweyn clan, Abbas spent an overwhelming majority of his life living in Dadaab Refugee Camps. By the age of 5, his parents moved with him and his siblings to Liboi Refugee camps in 1991 and later relocated to Dadaab refugee camp in 1992. Abbass as a bright young kid started his education with Qur'anic Dugsi (school) and completed learning the holy Qur'an before the age of 10. His father was a Sheikh and a respected scholar in the Somali community and so is his grandfather. It wasn't too long before he had a full grasp of the ahadith (prophet's teachings) and the Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence). He started primary school by the then Jack Asiyo Primary School later renamed as Halane Primary School (1994-1998) and proceeded to Midnimo ("Unity") primary school for Upper Primary education (1999-2001). He finished high school at Ifo Secondary School (ISS) in Ifo Camp (Dadaab) in 2005. He later proceeded to Nep Technical Training College (NEP TTC) in Garissa, NE Kenya. It was at NEP technical where Abbas had his first exposure to politics and was the president of the Students Union. Historically, there has always been a tension between the Somali students and the non-Somali students at Nep Technical. It was Abass that brokered peace between the two teams. He's remembered in his former alma mater as "Abass, the president, the peace maker!" He later joined Kenya Methodist University and then Moi University to pursue a degree in Business Administration. With high hopes and dreams of changing his motherland, Abbas went back to Somalia in 2011 to take a job with the humanitarian agencies working in Somalia. He worked with the likes of FAO and later fully moved on embarking politics. In 2016 he was selected by an Electoral college for the position as MP for Kismayo (House of the People) in the current term of the Federal Parliament of Somalia, otherwise known as the Tenth Parliament.  Minister of Public Works and Reconstruction On 21 March 2017, Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire named Hon. Siraji as the next Minister of Public Works and Reconstruction. He took office on 4 April during a handover ceremony at the Ministry of Public Works, making him the youngest ever cabinet member at age 31. In his short period as a public works minister, Abass implemented far more projects than the entire cabinet combined. This made him the most popular and one of the most loved politicians in Somalia. According to the Ministry of Public Works and Reconstruction website, Hon. Abass was in office for only one month but has done more than 30 months of tasks/work.  Death  Initial reports suggested that Siraji was shot and killed on 3 May 2017, when soldiers on a patrol opened fire as he drove his vehicle near the Villa Somalia. The circumstances of the shooting were not immediately clear. Media reports said the soldiers may have perceived Siraji's vehicle as a threat. A number of people have been reportedly arrested in connection with his death. Later reports have indicated that Siraji was traveling in his car behind a vehicle convoy bearing the Auditor General Nur Jimale Farah, when the bodyguards of the latter apparently somehow mistook Siraji's car for a VBIED being driven by a suicide bomber targeting the Auditor General and so opened fire on it. The minister received a full state funeral the day after his killing, attended by President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed and Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire along with other senior figures.   == References ==

Club and university rowing Rudkin was raised in Northampton. He was introduced to rowing by his father and joined the Hollowell Scullers club. He attended Stowe School on a sports scholarship and then Newcastle University. His senior club rowing was from the Newcastle University Boat Club where he was men's captain in 2015. In 2022, he won the Grand Challenge Cup (the blue riband event at the Henley Royal Regatta) in the seven seat of a composite Leander/Oxford Brookes crew. In 2023 again in Leander Club colours, he was at seven in the Leander/Oxford Brookes eight for another Grand Challenge Cup victory.  International representative career Rudkin progressed through the underage levels representing for Great Britain. He competed in junior match racing against France in 2010 & 2011 and then at the 2012 Junior World Rowing Championships he was selected in the GB quad scull which finished in overall twelfth place. He then raced in sweep oared crews at U23 World Rowing Championships in 2014, 2015 and 2016 winning a silver medal in the men's four at that 2016 regatta. Rudkin moved into the senior Great Britain squad in 2017 and held a seat in the GB men's eight consistently from 2017 to 2023. That crew finished in seventh place at the 2017 World Rowing Championships and achieved constant improvement thereafter.

Euphoria (stylized EUPHORIA) is the fifth major-label Japanese studio album (seventh overall) by South Korean pop-rock idol band CNBLUE. It was released on October 19, 2016, under Warner Music Japan. The date marks the five-year anniversary of the band's debut with its record label. Euphoria was released in four editions: Regular Edition, Limited Editions A and B, and a fan club-only Boice Limited Edition. It went on to debut at number two on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart. The band embarked on the CNBLUE 5th Anniversary Arena Tour 2016 "Our Glory Days" throughout November in Chiba, Osaka, Aichi, Fukuoka, and Tokyo.  Background CNBLUE announced Euphoria as its fifth studio album on the September 5, 2016 broadcast of Abema TV's Fresh!, with a release date of October 19. The date marks the five-year anniversary since the band's major-label debut in Japan with "In My Head". The album serves as the gratitude the band holds for its fans since then.  Music structure In "Glory Days", CNBLUE expresses gratitude towards its fans. The lyrics encourage one to "keep going on despite being lost on the path". Dealing with the future, "Take Me Higher" conveys the band's sentiment of exceeding its potential. Drummer Kang Min-hyuk described "Face to Face" as "good rhythmic song" and compared it to previously released songs "With Me" (Code Name Blue) and "Don't Care" (What Turns You On?). "Puzzle" is a wedding-themed song that revolves around "eternal love". "Royal Rumble" compromises a "rhythmical tone" and deals with "the next stop" for the band. The song revolves around the battle royals depicted in the professional wrestling organization WWE. Frontman Jung Yong-hwa described it as a general idea, in which he remarked, "anyone has to keep fighting, right?". Similar to "Daisy" (Colors), "Stay with Me" shows the band's thankfulness to its fans. In an interview with EMTG Music, the interviewer noted the positivity in the Euphoria singles, in contrast to singles released in the years prior which dealt with "conflicts and anxiety". In response, Jung stated: "When you listen to positive music, it makes you feel good, right? Now I wish more that you would listen to our music and become happy. Before, when something doesn’t work out the way I want, I would turn that into a song. Now, it also plays a big part that I have a very happy environment when making music."

The 1996 United States presidential election in Arkansas took place on November 5, 1996, as part of the 1996 United States presidential election. State voters chose six electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Arkansas, incumbent President Bill Clinton's home state, was won by Clinton by a 17% margin of victory. Republican nominee Bob Dole did not put up a challenge in Arkansas, nor did billionaire businessman Ross Perot (Ref-TX), who had unsuccessfully run for president as an independent in the previous election. Perot won 7.90 percent of the popular vote in Arkansas in 1996, a significant total for a third party candidate. As of the 2020 presidential election, this remains the last time that a Democratic presidential nominee has carried Arkansas. The state has swung rapidly towards the Republican Party in each subsequent election, transforming from a Democratic stronghold into one of the most staunchly Republican states in the nation. This is the last time Democrats flipped any county in the state.  This is also the last election in which Washington County, Columbia County, Arkansas County, Faulkner County, Union County, Garland County, Johnson County, Howard County, Calhoun County, Saline County, Perry County, Miller County, Van Buren County, Montgomery County, Madison County, Pike County, Logan County, White County, Lonoke County, Pope County, Independence County, Cleburne County, Yell County, Conway County, Franklin County, Grant County, Sharp County, Sevier County, Marion County, Stone County, Fulton County, Scott County, Prairie County, and Cleveland County voted for a Democratic presidential candidate.

Garbage Pail Kids is an American animated series which was produced in 1987, based on the Garbage Pail Kids trading cards, produced and directed by Bob Hathcock and co-written and developed by Flint Dille. Due to controversial themes, it did not air in the United States. However, it did air in certain countries around the world, including in Europe and the Caribbean.  Synopsis The series stars the characters Split Kit, Elliot Mess, Terri Cloth, Patty Putty, and Clogged Duane as gross-looking kids with abilities to help others. In the first two episodes, they have normal alter-egos, which transform into their "Garbage Pail" identities; later episodes show them exclusively in their Garbage Pail looks (it is never explained if their Garbage Pail personae became permanent). The show also features parodies of popular movies of the era like the Indiana Jones series, Superman, Conan the Barbarian, King Kong, and The Fly. It also has segments between stories, such as "Garbage Pail Groaners" (jokes) and "Would We Lie to You?" (facts).  Cast Main Tara Charendoff – Patty Putty (episodes 1–13), Still Jill (episode 3), Carly Cuts (episode 5) Cree Summer – Clogged Duane (episodes 1–13), Trashed Tracy (episode 1), Squishy (episode 2), Plain Jane (episode 3), Heartless Hal (episode 10), Noam Zylberman – Split Kit (episodes 1–13), Idaho Spud (episode 3), The Sturgeon General (episode 3) Michael Fantini – Elliot Mess (episodes 1–13), Clint Hardwood (episode 2), Colonel Corn (episode 3) Alyson Court – Terri Cloth (episodes 2–5, 7–13), Belle Button (episode 2), Lois Lamebrain (episode 7), Fay Hooray (episode 8) Len Carlson – Announcer (episodes 1–13), Dan Rattle (episodes 1 and 4)  Episodes DVD release Paramount Home Entertainment released Garbage Pail Kids: The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1 on April 4, 2006.  Controversy The CBS television network directly produced the series, and ordered an entire season, heavily promoting it in the run-up to the 1987–88 season. However, it was abruptly pulled a few days before its debut, and (just like Little Muppet Monsters) was replaced with an extra half hour of Muppet Babies, which was expanded to 90 minutes in order to fill the time-slot after Garbage Pail Kids was pulled from the schedule. CBS removed the series from their schedule, following protests from Action for Children's Television, the National Coalition on Television Violence, and the Christian Leaders for Responsible Television (a part of the American Family Association). The reasons given were that the series ridiculed the disabled and glorified violence, along with the claim that the program was effectively program-length ads for the toys and cards of the Garbage Pail Kids. Some advertisers, such as Nabisco, McDonald's and Crayola also pulled out, either due to pressure from interest groups, or because they were unable to pre-screen the series from advanced tapes. A few CBS affiliates, such as WIBW-TV in Topeka, Kansas, KOTV in Tulsa, Oklahoma, WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio, KHOU-TV in Houston, Texas and KREM-TV in Spokane, Washington made known they would not carry the series on their stations, notifying CBS of their pre-emptions weeks in advance of the debut. Despite not airing in the United States, the series did air in numerous other countries, including Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, among others.

Holyhood Cemetery is a cemetery located in Brookline, Massachusetts.  Description Laid out in 1857, the cemetery was designed to reflect the rural cemetery movement begun at Cambridge's Mount Auburn Cemetery. It was the first such cemetery in Brookline. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.  Most of the cemetery has the layout typical of rural cemeteries, with winding lanes and attractive landscaping.  One section, known as the "German Acre" and located near the entrance, has a more traditional rectilinear form; it was laid out for a congregation of predominantly German Catholics.  The cemetery chapel, built 1859–62, is set on a hill near its center, and was designed by Patrick Keely, an architect of Catholic churches.  It is a Gothic Revival structure, built out of puddingstone.  Notable burials Kennedy family Holyhood Cemetery is best known for being the final resting place of Joseph and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy (parents of U.S. President John, U.S. Attorney General Robert, and U.S. Senator Edward).

The Gabela camp or Gabela prison was a prison camp run by the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia and Croatian Defence Council in Gabela. The camp was located several kilometres south of Čapljina. Its prisoners were Bosniaks and Serbs.  The camp The camp consisted of detention facilities and a munitions warehouse. "Outside observers were not allowed to visit Gabela until August 1993. At this time the ICRC registered 1,100 inmates." The camp facilities were ammunition depots belonging to the former Yugoslav Army, consisting of four hangars marked 0, 1, 2, and 3, and three solitary confinement cells. The hangar size was 200 square metres, and up to 500 persons were held inside each. The detainees were exhausted by starvation and thirst, and were tortured. Ten litres of water were provided per 500 persons per day, so many drank urine to quench their thirst. The detainees had to perform their bodily functions in the hangars. They were forced to sing Croatian nationalist songs and to listen to lectures on how correct Croatian policies were. Upon entering the camp, detainees were exposed to special forms of torture. They were ordered to lie on their stomachs, and they would then be brutally beaten on their backs and heads. Some had their fingers broken by clamps. In early October, the camp warden, Boško Previšić, killed Mustafa Obradović in front of hangar No. 1, in the presence of a large number of detainees, after discovering a piece of bread concealed on him. Boško was seen talking to warcriminal mercenary and murderer Jackie Arklöv in the camp, before and after Arklöv had tortured prisoners.  Trials The former manager of the Gabela camp Boško Previšić has not been prosecuted and remains a fugitive. His deputy Nikola Andrun was sentenced to 13 years in prison for the crimes against civilians in Gabela by the State Court in Sarajevo. Former mercenary, Neo-Nazi, convicted bankrobber Jackie Arklöv was stationed at the camp as a guard and was convicted by Swedish court for brutal tortures of inmates there.

The Argentine Open Theatre was an independent theatre movement in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Overview Origins The theatre in Argentina had developed alongside the nation's emergence as a modern economy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Independent and experimental theatre, however, had long endured in the shadows of commercial productions (for which Buenos Aires' Corrientes Avenue became particularly well known). Many of the playwrights prominent in this movement were also politically opinionated, and their plays' left-leaning subtext were frowned upon by powerful figures in the Argentine military and the publishing sector, alike. Increasing repression became a serious threat to artistic freedom in the years shortly before and during the country's last dictatorship.  Opportunity and peril Intimidation and pressure were eased somewhat in 1980, however, with the support of the relatively moderate Army Chief, General Roberto Viola. Playwright Osvaldo Dragún seized the opportunity to organize a new theatre movement, calling on fellow playwrights Roberto Cossa and Carlos Gorostiza, as well as renowned theatre actors Luis Brandoni, Jorge Rivera López and Pepe Soriano. They purchased a shuttered sparkplug factory on Santos Discépolo Way (a pedestrianized backstreet in the crowded Balvanera district of Buenos Aires) into the "Picadero Theatre." Honored by the presence and support of Nobel laureate Adolfo Pérez Esquivel and writer Ernesto Sábato, the group announced, in a May 12, 1981, press conference, the establishment of the Teatro Abierto Argentino - the "Argentine Open Theatre." Sensitive both to the repressive climate and to the sharp economic crisis, playwright Carlos Somigliana penned the Open Theatre's mission statement, declaring that:  Being the theatre the cultural and social phenomenon that it is, we shall strive to recover the public at large with productions of great quality and modestly priced tickets.  They premiered their first festival on July 28, 1981, featuring Cossa's Gris de ausencia (Pale of Absence), Dragún's Mi obelisco y yo (My Obelisk and Me), and Gorostiza's El acompañamiento (The Entourage) among the evening's repertoire.  During an August 6 performance, however, three fire bombs were set off in the theatre, casting doubts on the company's viability (the incident remains one of Argentina's best-known "unsolved mysteries"). Sixteen prominent Buenos Aires theatres offered them their stages, however, and the Open Theatre relocated to the larger Tabaris Theatre, a Corrientes Avenue landmark known for its revue. The Open Theatre reopened two days later and its 1981 season ran until September 21, featuring 21 directors, over 150 cast and crew, and bringing together some 25,000 spectators. Organizer Osvaldo Dragún declared that "today the open theatre belongs to the entire nation."  Winning back the streets The ongoing economic collapse and replacement of President Viola for the hard-line General Leopoldo Galtieri led the company to plan the 1982 season with more precautions. Playwrights were invited to submit works well in advance, and the repertoire was expanded to include works of experimental theatre. Playwright Ricardo Monti contributed to the effort by publishing the "Open Theatre Magazine," a quarterly publication. The magazine provided a forum for potential participants as much as it prudently kept authorities abreast of its developments. Other fund-raising efforts included a coffee-table book, Teatro Abierto 1981, which sold 8,000 copies. None of the participants accepted compensation beyond covering their personal expenses related to the event, and any surplus profits were returned to the struggling company's fund. The Open Theatre's 1982 season, whose slogan was "winning back the streets," opened in late September with Dragún's Al violador (To the Rapist); Eugenio Griffero's provocative look at gay life in Argentina, Príncipe azul (Blue Prince); and Somigliana's daring criticism of the military, Oficial primero ("Commissioned Officer"), among other works from 30 other directors. Controversy ensued, however, when a number of well-known directors' works were passed over, notably Pacho O'Donnell's; negative national sentiment on the heels of the disastrous Falklands War helped further dampen interest in the season, which closed in November. The 1983 season was produced in the Margarita Xirgu Theatre amid Argentina's imminent return to democracy, and its featured plays were more politically daring than those of the two previous seasons. Dragún's Hoy se comen al flaco (Today They'll Take the Skinny Guy) headlined the opening night on September 24. Banned by the dictatorship, murgas were included in the season as theatrical works. The carnival-like marches often paraded out of the theatre house, and included banned left-wing themes. Other works included odes to tragedies in Chile and Nicaragua. The season concluded with a murga marching against censorship, and the burning of an effigy of censorship itself ("La Censurona").  The theatre strikes back El teatrazo ("The Attack of the Theatre") as the slogan of the 1984 season was thought of by its organizers as way to "share our opinion in the context of liberty." The return of democracy, however, also helped deprive the festival of its status as the leading forum for artistic defiance of a repressive regime; indeed, one of the Open Theatre's leading figures, Carlos Gorostiza, had been appointed Secretary of Culture by newly elected President Raúl Alfonsín. Following the failure of the 1984 season, musch of which was cancelled, the company dedicated its 1985 season to young playwrights. That season featured works from throughout Latin America and, opening on September 21, it was more successful than its predecessor; but a sixth season was cancelled, leaving the Open Theatre a place in Argentine history as "a modest popular resistance and, among the cultural ones, the most visible."   == References and external links ==

Nathaniel Fanning (31 May 1755 – 30 September 1805) was an officer in the Continental Navy and later the United States Navy, who served aboard Bonhomme Richard during its 1779 battle with HMS Serapis. Fanning was born in Stonington, Connecticut, and was the eldest son of Gilbert Fanning and Huldah Palmer.  His father was a sea merchant who was one of the largest provisioners of General George Washington's army during the American Revolution. On May 26, 1778, Fanning embarked from Boston, Massachusetts, aboard the brig Angelica as a prizemaster under the command of Captain William Denison in a cruise against the British.  On May 31, Angelica was captured by the British man-of-war Andromeda and blown up, with Fanning being made a prisoner.  Aboard Andromeda was General William Howe, who was returning to England.  By orders of General Howe, the Americans were confined to the hold and treated severely, being allowed but a half-pint of water per day per man, even though the heat was so unbearable that the men were obliged to strip off all their clothes. On June 30, 1778, Andromeda reached Portsmouth, England, and Fanning was incarcerated at Forton prison.  On July 2, 1779, Fanning was included in a prisoner exchange.  He was marched to Gosport, then taken by cartel to Nantes, France.  From there, he traveled to L'Orient, where, under the command of John Paul Jones, he agreed to serve as midshipman and private secretary aboard Bonhomme Richard On August 14, 1779, Bonhomme Richard set sail, and over the next month captured or destroyed at least 29 enemy vessels.  On September 23, Bonhomme Richard famously fought the British frigate Serapis.  During this engagement, Fanning served as captain of the main top. Most of his original group of men were killed, but he took a fresh party aloft and with them cleared Serapis' tops. When their yards locked the ships together, he led his men across to the British ship, where with hand grenades and mortars, they drove the British seamen from their stations. In recommending that Fanning be promoted, Jones said of him ". . . he was one cause among the prominent in obtaining the victory".  Bonhomme Richard was destroyed during this battle, but the Americans sailed to Holland aboard Serapis. Fanning continued to serve under Jones aboard his new ship Alliance and later Ariel.  Fanning then served as second-in-command aboard the privateer Count de Guichen.  On March 23, 1781, they set sail from Morlaix and for many weeks ransomed or sunk numerous enemy vessels.  But on May 4, the privateer was captured by Aurora and Fanning was again made prisoner, but paroled after six weeks. On December 3, 1781, Fanning sailed from Ostend aboard Eclipse and had another productive cruise, returning to Dunkirk on March 6, 1782.  While Eclipse was being refitted, Fanning made two trips to London, once as a spy and once to deliver peace proposals from the court of French King Louis XVI.  On June 6, Eclipse left for the coast of Scotland under the command of Fanning.  On August 11, Eclipse was chased by Jupiter, said to be the fastest ship in the Royal Navy.  To escape Jupiter, Fanning ordered Eclipse to pass directly through the middle of the British Channel Fleet in broad daylight.  To evade capture, he hoisted English colors and when hailed, answered that the ship was His Majesty's cutter Surprise. Two days later, Fanning was wounded in the left leg by a musketball while capturing Lord Howe.  He sailed for Dunkirk and spent several weeks recovering.  In October 1782, he was commissioned as lieutenant in the French Navy.  On October 23, he sailed from Dunkirk in command of the privateer Ranger, but it was captured by a British cutter.  Fanning was promptly exchanged, but his crew members, being Irish, were all executed as traitors. Returning to Dunkirk, Fanning set sail again on November 14, but was captured a fourth time by the British frigate Belle Poule.  Fanning was placed in chains, and abused by the crew.  He was rescued when his captors' ship was, in turn, captured by the French Navy.  Learning that a peace treaty was imminent, Fanning attempted to launch yet another expedition against the British, but was unable to set sail before further privateering was prohibited. Fanning returned to the United States and, on December 5, 1804, was commissioned a lieutenant in the U.S Navy.  While stationed in Charleston, South Carolina, Lieutenant Fanning died of yellow fever on September 30, 1805, while commanding Gunboat Number 1. During the American Revolution, two of Fanning's brothers, Gilbert and Thomas, were captured while serving aboard an American privateer and held prisoner on the prison hulk HMS Jersey, where Gilbert died. Fanning was also the brother of explorer Edmund Fanning and a first cousin of celebrated attorney John Wickham.  Namesake Three ships in the United States Navy have been named USS Fanning for him.

Sagamore Pendry Baltimore is a former warehouse in the heart of the Fells Point neighborhood in Baltimore. The head house formally known as the Recreation Pier or Rec Pier stood vacant for more than 15 years. The brick Beaux Arts building originally stored port cargo.  History Sagamore Pendry Baltimore is located within the 1700 Block of Thames Street, it opened on August 20, 1914; built by the city at a cost of over $1 million ($24 million USD today) as a commercial pier by Theodore Wells Pietsch I. The Recreation Pier as it was known served as a landing point for thousands of new immigrants processed across the Patapsco river at the Locust Point immigration station. The ferry continued to serve as an important social and economic link between the Fells Point and Locust Point communities until it finally closed in 1937. Over the years the premises served a number of roles such as a meeting place for early 20th-century Baltimore immigrants with a rooftop playground space for children, to a maritime radio station headquartered within the pier. It was also used as a parking garage.  In fiction From 1993-1999, the pier had been occupied as the police headquarters for the television series, Homicide: Life on the Street.  More recently it was the set of the fictional Maryland School for the arts in the films Step Up and Step Up 2: the Streets.  Restoration and reuse Over the years, many developers have tried to transform the 100-year-old pier. Previous developers struggled to find financing for the project because the pier needed so much work. A major piece of the pier's restoration involved replacing the pilings that are driven underwater and into the Baltimore harbor bed, an expensive undertaking. The restoration of the pier clocked in 200,000 worker-hours, $250,000 worth of asbestos and $300,000 worth of lead paint removal alone. Developers also had to comply with preservation rules, and address potential flood risks.  Sagamore Pendry Baltimore, was designed by New York and Baltimore based BHC Architects, constructed by Whiting-Turner with interiors by Patrick Sutton Design.

John Lindley Byrne (; born July 6, 1950) is a British-born American writer and artist of superhero comics. Since the mid-1970s, Byrne has worked on many major superheroes; with noted work on Marvel Comics's X-Men and Fantastic Four. Byrne also facilitated the 1986 relaunch of DC Comics's Superman franchise with the limited series The Man of Steel, the first issue of which featured the comics' first variant cover. Coming into the comics profession as a penciller, inker, letterer, and writer on his earliest work, Byrne began co-plotting the X-Men comics during his tenure on them, for story arcs including "Dark Phoenix Saga" and "Days of Future Past", and co-creating characters such as Kitty Pryde, Emma Frost, Sabretooth, Shadow King, and Rachel Summers. Byrne launched his writing career in earnest with Fantastic Four, also serving as penciler and inker, and included She-Hulk onto the team while writing a solo series for The Thing. While working on X-Men, he created the Canadian superhero team Alpha Flight, and later wrote and drew their own series. Moving to DC, Byrne established the modern origin for Superman in The Man of Steel before writing and drawing two monthly titles and various miniseries for the character. Byrne then returned to Marvel, introducing the Great Lakes Avengers, and wrote and drew the humorous fourth wall-breaking series The Sensational She-Hulk. He also co-created the Marvel characters Scott Lang and James Rhodes. During the 1990s he produced a number of creator-owned works, including Next Men and Danger Unlimited, and was one of the founders of the Legend imprint at Dark Horse Comics. Revisiting X-Men as a writer, Byrne co-created Bishop and Omega Red. Byrne was the writer and artist of the Wonder Woman series for three years, during which he created the second Wonder Girl, Cassie Sandsmark. In addition, he co-created the DC character Amanda Waller. He scripted the first issues of Mike Mignola's Hellboy series and produced several Star Trek comics for IDW Publishing. In 2010, Byrne revived Next Men to conclude the series. Hailed as one of the most prolific and influential comic book artists ever, Byrne and his X-Men collaborator Chris Claremont were entered into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2015.  Early life and career Byrne was born on July 6, 1950 in Walsall, Staffordshire, and raised in West Bromwich, also in Staffordshire, where he lived with his parents, Frank and Nelsie, and his maternal grandmother. He was an only child. His father was a town planner and his mother was a homemaker. While living in England, prior to his family emigrating to Canada when Byrne was 8, he was first exposed to comics, saying in 2005,  [M]y 'journey into comics' began with [star] George Reeves' [Adventures of] Superman series being shown on the BBC in England when I was about 6 years old. Not long after I started watching that series I saw one of the hardcover, black and white 'Annuals' that were being published over there at the time, and soon after found a copy of an Australian reprint called Super Comics  that featured a story each of Superboy, Johnny Quick and Batman. The Batman story hooked me for life. A couple of years later my family emigrated to Canada (for the second time, no less!) and I discovered the vast array of American comics available at the time. His first encounter with Marvel Comics was in 1962 with Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four #5. He later commented that "the book had an 'edge' like nothing DC was putting out at the time". Jack Kirby's work, in particular, had a strong influence on Byrne and he has worked with many of the characters Kirby created or co-created. Besides Kirby, Byrne was influenced by the naturalistic style of Neal Adams. Byrne has named comic books, The Lord of the Rings, and Star Trek: The Original Series as his greatest influences. Despite drawing comics as a youth, Byrne intended to have a career as a commercial artist. In 1970, Byrne enrolled at the Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary. He created the superhero parody Gay Guy for the college newspaper, which poked fun at the campus stereotype of homosexuality among art students. Gay Guy is notable for featuring the first gay superhero. While there, he published his first comic book, ACA Comix #1, featuring "The Death's Head Knight". Byrne left the college in 1973 without graduating. Before finding success with comic books, Byrne spent three years designing billboards for an advertisement company. He broke into comics with a "Fan Art Gallery" piece in Marvel's promotional publication FOOM in early 1974 and by illustrating a two-page story by writer Al Hewetson in Skywald Publications' black-and-white horror magazine Nightmare #20 (Aug. 1974). He then began freelancing for Charlton Comics, making his color-comics debut with the E-Man backup feature "Rog-2000", starring a robot character he'd created in the mid-1970s that colleagues Roger Stern and Bob Layton named and began using for spot illustrations in their fanzine CPL (Contemporary Pictorial Literature). A Rog-2000 story written by Stern, with art by Byrne and Layton, had gotten the attention of Charlton Comics editor Nicola Cuti, who extended Byrne an invitation. Written by Cuti, "Rog-2000" became one of several alternating backup features in the Charlton Comics superhero series E-Man, starting with the eight-page "That Was No Lady" in issue #6 (Jan. 1975). While that was Byrne's first published color-comics work, "My first professional comic book sale was to Marvel, a short story called Dark Asylum' ... which languished in a flat file somewhere until it was used as filler in Giant-Size Dracula #5 [(June 1975)], long after the first Rog story." The story was plotted by Tony Isabella and written by David Anthony Kraft. After the Rog-2000 story, Byrne went on to work on the Charlton books Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch, Space: 1999, and Emergency!, and co-created with writer Joe Gill the post-apocalyptic science-fiction series Doomsday + 1. Byrne additionally drew a cover for the supernatural anthology The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves #54 (Dec. 1975).  Marvel Comics Byrne said he broke into Marvel comics after writer Chris Claremont  ...saw [his Charlton] work and began agitating for [him] to draw something he had written. When [artist] Pat Broderick missed a deadline on the 'Iron Fist' series in Marvel Premiere, [production manager] John Verpoorten fired him and offered the book to [Byrne]. ... [Byrne] turned around the first script in time to meet the deadline, and so started getting more work from Marvel, until [he] was able to leave Charlton and focus entirely on the Marvel stuff." Byrne soon went on to draw series including The Champions (#12–15, 17 1977–78) and Marvel Team-Up (#53–55, 59–70, 75, 79, 100). Byrne first drew the X-Men in Marvel Team-Up #53. For many issues, he was paired with Claremont, with whom he teamed for issue #11 of the black-and-white Marvel magazine Marvel Preview featuring Star-Lord. The Star-Lord story was inked by Terry Austin and lettered by Tom Orzechowski, both of whom soon afterward teamed with Claremont and Byrne on Uncanny X-Men.  The Uncanny X-Men Byrne joined Claremont beginning with X-Men #108 (Dec. 1977), which was later renamed The Uncanny X-Men with issue #114. Their work together, along with inker Terry Austin, on such classic story arcs as "Proteus", "Dark Phoenix Saga", and "Days of Future Past" would make them both fan favorites. Byrne insisted that the title keep its Canadian character, Wolverine, and contributed a series of story elements to justify Wolverine's presence which eventually made the character among the most popular in Marvel's publishing history. With issue #114, Byrne began co-plotting the series as well as penciling. Claremont recounted that "at that point in time John and I were, in a very real sense, true collaborators on the book. It was with very few exceptions, difficult, for me, anyway, to tell in the actual gestation of the book where one of us left off and the other began – because it involved one of us coming up with an idea and bouncing it off the other ..." The "Dark Phoenix Saga" in 1980 is one of the most notable stories in the title's history. Comics writers and historians Roy Thomas and Peter Sanderson observed that "'The Dark Phoenix Saga' is to Claremont and Byrne what the 'Galactus Trilogy' is to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It is a landmark in Marvel history, showcasing its creators' work at the height of their abilities." Byrne has repeatedly compared his working relationship with Claremont to Gilbert and Sullivan, and has said that they were "almost constantly at war over who the characters were." Byrne created the characters Alpha Flight, Proteus, and Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat during his run on The X-Men. A new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by Mystique, was introduced in the "Days of Future Past" storyline (#141–142, Jan.-Feb. 1981) in which a time-travelling Kitty Pryde tried to avert a dystopian future caused by the Brotherhood assassinating Presidential candidate Senator Robert Kelly. Byrne plotted the story wanting to depict the Sentinels as a genuine threat to the existence of the mutant race. Byrne left The X-Men with #143 (March 1981). During his tenure on the series, The X-Men was promoted from a bimonthly to a monthly publication schedule as sales steadily increased—a trend that continued long after Byrne left. In the late 1970s, while serving as the regular penciller of X-Men, Byrne began penciling another superhero team title, The Avengers. Working for the most part with writer David Michelinie, he drew issues #164–166 and 181–191. Byrne and Michelinie co-created Scott Lang in Avengers #181 (March 1979). Byrne's nine-issue run of Captain America, issues #247–255 (July 1980 – March 1981), with writer Roger Stern, included issue #250, in which the character mulled running for the office of President of the United States.  Fantastic Four Byrne's post-X-Men body of work at Marvel includes his six-year run on Fantastic Four (#232–295, July 1981 – October 1986), which is generally considered a "second golden age" for the title. Byrne said his goal was to "turn the clock back ... get back and see fresh what it was that made the book great at its inception". He made a number of changes during his tenure: The Thing was temporarily replaced as a member of the quartet by the She-Hulk, while the Thing had adventures in his own comic (#1–22 also written by Byrne), and the Thing's longtime girlfriend Alicia Masters left him for his teammate the Human Torch; the Invisible Girl was developed into the most powerful member with the heightened control of her refined powers and the self-confident assertiveness to use it epitomized by her name change to the Invisible Woman; and headquarters the Baxter Building was destroyed and replaced with Four Freedoms Plaza. Byrne has cited multiple reasons for leaving the series, including "internal office politics" and that "it simply started to get old".  Alpha Flight In 1983, while still at the helm of Fantastic Four, Byrne began to write and draw Alpha Flight, starring a Canadian superhero team that had been introduced "merely to survive a fight with the X-Men." The series proved initially very popular, with its first issue selling over half a million copies, and the following issues selling between 400,000 and 500,000 issues each month. However, Byrne has said the title "was never much fun" and that he considered the characters two-dimensional. One of Alpha Flight's characters, Northstar, eventually became Marvel's first openly gay superhero. Though Byrne from the beginning intended the character to be gay, Northstar's homosexuality was only hinted at during Byrne's tenure on the series.  Indiana Jones In 1983 Byrne co-wrote and penciled issues 1 and 2 of The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones, a two-part story arc titled "The Ikons of Ikammanen". The story involves archaeologist Edith Dunne, a former student-turned-enemy of Jones. Byrne wrote the first issue and Dennis O'Neil wrote the second, while Byrne penciled both issues with Terry Austin as the inker.  Incredible Hulk In 1985, after issue #28 of Alpha Flight, Byrne swapped the series with Bill Mantlo, writer of The Incredible Hulk. According to Byrne, he discussed his ideas with editor-in-chief Jim Shooter ahead of time, but once Byrne was on the title, Shooter objected to them. Byrne wrote and drew issues #314–319. The final issue of Byrne's run featured the wedding of Bruce Banner and Betty Ross.  DC Comics The Untold Legend of the Batman In early 1980, Byrne did his first work for DC Comics, penciling the first issue of The Untold Legend of the Batman miniseries. Byrne had always wanted to draw Batman, and had a three-month window of time during which he was not under contract to Marvel. Hearing about the Untold Legend series, Byrne contacted editor Paul Levitz to express interest. DC took him up on his offer, but it was not until the second month of his three-month window that Byrne received the plot for the first issue. Byrne told Levitz that he would not be able to finish the project due to time constraints despite DC then allegedly offering Byrne double his Marvel pay rate, after initially saying they could not match his Marvel rate. Byrne penciled the first issue, which was inked by Jim Aparo after being intended for Terry Austin. This experience soured Byrne on DC for quite some time.  Superman Near the end of his time at Marvel, Byrne was hired by DC Comics to revamp its flagship character Superman. This was part of a company-wide restructuring of the history of the DC Universe and all of its characters following the limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths. Byrne's reworking of Superman in particular gained widespread media coverage outside the comic book industry, including articles in Time and The New York Times. At the time, Byrne said, "I'm taking Superman back to the basics ... It's basically Siegel and Shuster's Superman meets the Fleischer Superman in 1986."  Byrne significantly reduced Superman's powers (though he was still one of the most powerful beings on Earth), eliminated the Fortress of Solitude and super-dog Krypto, and kept Jonathan and Martha Kent alive into Clark's adulthood to enjoy their adopted son's triumphs, as well as to provide him with support, grounding, and advice whenever he needed it. Byrne also used Marv Wolfman's idea of making Lex Luthor a wealthy business owner in addition to a scientific genius with a deadly vendetta against the superhero. Byrne did away with the childhood/teenage career as Superboy; in his revamped history, Clark Kent does not put on a costume and become a super-hero until adulthood. This approach to Kent's path to becoming Superman was later used in the TV series  Lois & Clark and Smallville, and in the 2005 novel It's Superman by Tom De Haven. In the Superman mythos, Byrne wrote Clark Kent as having a more aggressive and extroverted personality than previously depicted, comparing him to Jimmy Breslin, and even making him a top high-school football player. Byrne came up with explanations for how Superman's disguise works, such as the public simply does not realize that he has a secret identity since he is unmasked, that Superman would vibrate his face via his super speed in order to blur his image to photographers, and having Kent keep a weight training set around to explain how the human and presumably weaker Kent could have a frame as massive as Superman's. Byrne described Superman as becoming a "Super Republican", seeking to incorporate renewed interest in American patriotism during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Byrne's Superman felt that his deepest roots were on Earth and that his home planet of "Krypton is anathema to him". The origin and early career of Byrne's version of Superman debuted in the six-issue miniseries The Man of Steel (July–Sept. 1986), the first issue of which was marketed with two different covers illustrated by Byrne, the first use of variant covers by the American comics industry. DC Executive Editor Dick Giordano had been looking for a writer to restart the Superman continuity from scratch, and began talking with Byrne in May 1985 to discuss what Byrne would do with Superman if offered the job. With DC agreeing with 99% of the revision, Byrne was given the go-ahead for what became The Man of Steel. Comics historian Timothy Callahan argued that Superman in modern media has more in common with Byrne's portrayal of the character than those of Cary Bates, Elliot S. Maggin, Dennis O'Neil, Jerry Siegel, and Edmond Hamilton. Brian Cronin of Comic Book Resources suggested that, although Byrne made several changes, Byrne's Superman was still more similar to previous depictions of the character than he was not. Byrne penciled the six-issue DC Universe crossover miniseries Legends (Nov. 1986 – May 1987) during this time. He wrote and drew two monthly Superman titles with the hero's present-day adventures: a new Superman title beginning with issue #1 (January 1987) and Action Comics, in which, beginning with issue #584, Superman teamed up with other DC characters. The original Superman book was renamed The Adventures of Superman starting with issue #424 and was initially written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by Jerry Ordway, but the writing chores were taken over by Byrne after a year from issues #436–442 and 444. As 1988 marked the 50th anniversary year of Superman's creation, Byrne did more Superman-related projects while working on the core Superman monthly titles at the same time: he wrote the prestige format graphic novel, Superman: The Earth Stealers and three separate four-issue miniseries: The World of Krypton, The World of Metropolis, and The World of Smallville. He supplied the cover art for the March 14, 1988, issue of Time magazine and an interior spread featuring Superman, where his pencils were inked by Ordway. After his initial run on the Superman titles from 1986 to 1988, Byrne would make a return as a guest inker on Adventures of Superman Annual #2 (cover) and Superman #50 in 1990. He would return doing a Superman Elseworlds story as a writer and artist in Action Comics Annual #6 in 1994. In 2004 Superman: True Brit, an Elseworlds story, was a collaboration with former Monty Python member John Cleese and Kim Johnson, with art by Byrne and inker Mark Farmer. Byrne returned to draw Superman in Action Comics #827–835, working with writer Gail Simone, from 2005 to 2006. Byrne spent about two years on the Superman titles before leaving. His dissatisfaction stemmed from his perception that there was a lack of "conscious support" for him at DC. Furthering the rift between the company and the artist was the fact that the version of Superman which DC licensed for merchandising was contrary to Byrne's representation in the comic books.  Return to Marvel Star Brand In 1986, Marvel began publication of a new line of superhero titles created by then-Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter, which took place in a continuum removed from the Marvel Universe proper, called the New Universe. In 1987, the New Universe line saw a revamp under new Editor-in-Chief Tom DeFalco, and Byrne took over writing and art breakdowns on the line's flagship title, Star Brand (renamed The Star Brand during Byrne's term on the book). Byrne's run started with issue #11 and continued until the series' cancellation eight issues later upon Marvel's discontinuation of the New Universe line.  Avengers West Coast In 1989, after leaving Superman, Byrne returned to work on a number of titles for Marvel Comics. His work on West Coast Avengers (issues #42–57, soon renamed Avengers West Coast) was contingent on his being allowed to do what he called "my Vision story". The Vision was a long-standing Marvel superhero and member of The Avengers, an android originally created by the villain Ultron constructed with the body of the original Human Torch. The Vision went on to join the team, marry his teammate the Scarlet Witch, and father two children by her. Byrne radically changed this, revealing that Immortus – who previously had revealed to the Avengers the synthezoid's origin – lied about the Vision's creation. The android Human Torch was found and joined the WCA. The Vision was disassembled and stripped of his emotions. The couple's twins were revealed to be pieces of the soul of the demon Mephisto. In addition to these changes, Byrne's run is remembered for the introduction of the Great Lakes Avengers, an eclectic group of new superheroes.  The Sensational She-Hulk During She-Hulk's tenure with the Fantastic Four, she appeared in Marvel Graphic Novel #18 (Nov. 1985) in a story titled The Sensational She-Hulk, which Byrne wrote and illustrated.  On the request of editor Mark Gruenwald, Byrne wrote and drew a new series in 1989, The Sensational She-Hulk (maintaining the 1985 graphic novel's title). Gruenwald directed that it be significantly different from the character's previous series, The Savage She-Hulk. Byrne's take was comedic and the She-Hulk, who was aware she was in a comic book, regularly broke the fourth wall, developing a love-hate relationship with her artist/writer by criticizing his storylines, drawing style, character development, etc. Byrne left the book after writing and drawing the first eight issues. Byrne was asked for input on writer Dwayne McDuffie's She-Hulk: Ceremony limited series, and according to Byrne, most of his objections to the story and notations of errors were ignored, and his editor, Bobbie Chase, "was rewriting my stuff to bring it into line with" the story in Ceremony. Upon complaining to DeFalco, Byrne says he was fired from his series. He later returned to write and draw issues #31–50 under new editor Renée Witterstaetter.  Namor, the Sub-Mariner Byrne started a new series, Namor, the Sub-Mariner in April 1990. Byrne's take on the undersea antihero Namor cast him as the head of a surface company, Oracle, Inc., in order to help keep the ocean unpolluted, and had Namor involved in corporate intrigue. After writing and drawing the book for 25 issues, Byrne told editor Terry Kavanagh that he was starting to feel constrained on the book and thought having a different artist might inspire him to a fresh approach. Kavanagh suggested newcomer Jae Lee, and Byrne continued strictly as the writer of the book up through issue #32. Byrne later said he has great fondness for the title character and was unhappy that circumstances forced him to leave the series.  Iron Man Byrne took over writing Iron Man for issues #258–277 (July 1990-Feb. 1992), drawn by John Romita Jr. and later by Paul Ryan. Byrne launched a second "Armor Wars" story arc, restored the Mandarin as a major Iron Man nemesis, and featured the 1950s "pre-superhero Marvel" monster Fin Fang Foom. During the course of his run, Byrne became the first writer to retcon Iron Man's origin, removing explicit ties to the Vietnam War (while maintaining a Southeast Asia setting), and linking Wong-Chu, the man who captured Tony Stark, to the Mandarin.  Creator-owned works In the early 1990s, Byrne began creating a series of original, creator-owned works for publisher Dark Horse Comics. This was during a general trend in the industry for established creators working for Marvel and DC to bring their original works to other publishers or create their own companies to publish the works themselves (one prominent example is Image Comics). A number of these creators, including Byrne, Frank Miller, Mike Mignola, and Art Adams, banded together to form the Legend imprint at Dark Horse. Byrne's first title for Dark Horse was Next Men, a work he considered darker and more realistic than his previous work. The Next Men were five young people who were the product of a secret government experiment. Byrne said, "I thought I would see what I could do with superheroes in the 'real world' " and "[e]xplore the impact their existence would have." Byrne's other Dark Horse titles were Babe, and Danger Unlimited, an all-age readers book about a team of heroes in the future fighting an alien occupation of Earth. The Next Men lasted until issue 30 in 1994, when Byrne ended the series, intending to return "in no more than six months." Byrne says he "did not count on...the virtual collapse of the whole comic book industry, which seemed to occur at just the time I put Next Men on the shelf...In the present, very depressed marketplace, I don't feel Next Men would have much chance, so I leave the book hibernating until such time as the market improves." IDW Publishing revived John Byrne's Next Men in 2010 following a series of trade paperbacks that collected the first series. The original storyline that had a cliffhanger ending in 1995 was continued.  Later career In later years, Byrne has worked on titles for Marvel, DC, and other publishers, including the 1992 prestige format graphic novel Green Lantern: Ganthet's Tale with science fiction author Larry Niven at DC. In 1989, Byrne wrote Batman #433–435 (May–July 1989) and in the following year produced a 3-D graphic novel with 3-D effects by Ray Zone. He returned to the X-Men franchise at Marvel from 1991 to 1992, succeeding longtime writer Chris Claremont, who left after 17 years working on the various X-Men related titles. Byrne's return as the new writer was brief, as he only scripted Uncanny X-Men issues #281–285 and 288 with artist Whilce Portacio, and X-Men issues #4–5 with artist Jim Lee. In 1995, Byrne wrote and drew the Marvel/DC intercompany crossover Darkseid vs. Galactus: The Hunger, which also featured the Jack Kirby creations the Silver Surfer and the New Gods. In 1996, another Marvel/DC intercompany crossover - Batman/Captain America, one shot homage to Golden Age versions of both heroes. He wrote and drew another of DC's signature series, the long-running Wonder Woman, from 1995 to 1998. During that time, he elevated the super-heroine to the status of a goddess who then ascended to Mount Olympus as the Goddess of Truth, and created Cassie Sandsmark, the new Wonder Girl. Byrne then spotlighted supporting characters such as Queen Hippolyta in their own adventures but restored the series' status quo in his last issue. He additionally took over New Gods vol. 4 at the end of 1996, as writer-artist of issues #12–15, continuing with it as the series was rebooted with a new #1 as Jack Kirby's Fourth World. That ran 20 issues from 1997 to 1998. During his tenure on the New Gods, Byrne was writer of the four-issue miniseries crossover Genesis, a storyline published weekly by DC Comics in August 1997. The series was drawn by Ron Wagner and Joe Rubinstein. Byrne wrote a Wonder Woman prose novel, Wonder Woman: Gods and Goddesses (1997).  In the series Spider-Man: Chapter One, Byrne retold some of Spider-Man's earliest adventures, changing some key aspects. In late 1998, Byrne became writer of the flagship series The Amazing Spider-Man at the end of the series with issue #440, by which time Marvel had decided to relaunch the book. The "last" issue of The Amazing Spider-Man was #441 (November 1998), with Marvel re-initiating the series with a new volume 2, issue #1 (Jan. 1999) with Howard Mackie as writer and Byrne on pencils. Byrne penciled issues #1–18 (from 1999 to 2000) and wrote #13–14. In 1999, Byrne, working with artist Ron Garney, wrote the first seven issues of a new Hulk series, as well as the summer annual. From 1999 to 2001, Byrne returned to the X-Men to write and draw X-Men: The Hidden Years which ran for 22 issues. Byrne explained the title's cancellation by saying, "I was officially informed yesterday that, despite the fact that they are still profitable, several 'redundant' X-Titles are being axed." This disagreement factored in his decision to no longer work for Marvel Comics. Like X-Men: The Hidden Years, some other works of this period involved characters and events in time periods other than the present and, in some cases, considered "skipped over" (Marvel: The Lost Generation), or alternate timelines (DC's Superman & Batman: Generations); a feature some of these have in common is to have characters who actually age during the course of the series, which is uncommon for characters in ongoing comics. In early 2003, Byrne spent ten weeks as a guest penciler on the syndicated newspaper strip Funky Winkerbean. Byrne did this as a favor for Winkerbean's creator, Tom Batiuk, who was recovering from foot surgery. He would later become the final person to draw Funky Winkerbean, taking over illustration duties from artist Chuck Ayers for the strip's concluding week, ending on December 31, 2022. Most of his work in the first decade of the new millennium was for DC Comics: JLA (issues #94–99 in 2004, co-writing and illustrating the "Tenth Circle" story arc, reuniting with his Uncanny X-Men writer Chris Claremont and with Jerry Ordway as inker), Doom Patrol, Blood of the Demon, a five-issue arc of JLA Classified. He penciled an issue of Hawkman (vol. 4) #26 in May 2004. Superman: True Brit was a collaboration with former Monty Python member John Cleese and Kim Johnson, with art by Byrne and inker Mark Farmer. Byrne returned to draw Superman in Action Comics #827–835, working with writer Gail Simone, from 2005 to 2006. Afterward, Simone and Byrne reteamed to launch The All-New Atom series in 2006, with Byrne pencilling the first three issues. For publisher IDW, Byrne worked on the superhero series FX #1–6, written by Wayne Osborne, starting with the March 2008 issue. His other projects for the publisher include stories for the Star Trek and Angel franchises. Byrne's Star Trek work included the final issue of the miniseries Star Trek: Alien Spotlight (February 2008); Star Trek: Assignment: Earth #1–5; Star Trek: Romulans #1–2, Star Trek: Crew (a Christopher Pike-era comic book focusing on the character of "Number One") started in March 2009; the final chapter of his Romulans story, a four-issue miniseries, Star Trek: Leonard McCoy, Frontier Doctor, set before Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and the second Assignment: Earth series. His work on Angel included Angel: Blood and Trenches (set during World War I); an Angel vs Frankenstein one-shot; and an Andy Hallett tribute, Angel: Music of the Spheres and Angel vs Frankenstein II in 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively. In 2011, he worked on Jurassic Park: The Devils in the Desert, and Cold War (The Michael Swann Dossier). He revived his Next Men series in 2010–2011, with the sequel series Aftermath. Other work for IDW includes the 2012 miniseries Trio and the 2013 miniseries The High Ways and Doomsday.1. In 2018, Byrne began X-Men Elsewhen, a fan-fiction comic book exploring how he would've continued the story of the X-Men after "The Dark Phoenix Saga". The series, written and pencilled by Byrne and published on his website, has 32 issues as of December 2022.  Controversies Over the years, Byrne has gained a reputation as a controversial figure within the community of comic book pros and fans. He has himself noted that "as the people who have figured me out have said, I just don't suffer fools gladly." Gail Simone, who worked with Byrne on The All New Atom in 2006, described Byrne as "very opinionated; a lot of artists are opinionated, and I'm okay with that. Actually, I think John Byrne is brilliant and his forceful personality is part of that." In 1981, Jack Kirby began speaking publicly about his belief that he had been deprived of fair credit and money while creating the majority of Marvel's top characters. Byrne wrote an editorial declaring himself "proud" to be a "company man", and arguing that all creators should "live within the rules while they're around." Steve Gerber and Kirby lampooned Byrne's position in Destroyer Duck, drawing him as a character called Booster Cogburn, possessing no genitals, a removable spine, and existing only to serve as a cog in the mammoth corporation that owned him. Byrne later made a story in Action Comics #592–593 where Big Barda (who is based on Kirby's wife Roz) is brainwashed and almost forced to make a pornographic video with Superman. Erik Larsen created a villain in the 1990s for his Savage Dragon and the Freak Force series, Johnny Redbeard / the Creator, who is a parody of Byrne; a massive cranium with atrophied appendages, he can bestow superpowers indiscriminately. Regarding the ownership rights for Superman, Byrne has stated: "And I've always been terribly pragmatic about that kind of stuff. This is where my low BS threshold touched on in the sense that I looked at the story of Siegel and Shuster, for example, and I said, well, that's kind of sad that they created this huge, iconic character and didn't make a hundred bajillion dollars for it. But that's also what the situation was; that was the deal. And everybody understood that was the deal. They weren't cheated. They knew what it was going in." In a 2006 interview, Byrne further elaborated on his creator's rights views:  I feel myself to be a company man. When the company is worth supporting, I'll support the company. If the company's honest with me up front, I support the company. I see no reason not to. And I was always campaigning for creator's rights. I was always out there saying, yeah, it would be a good idea if things changed. But too many of my contemporaries—I'm not going to name names here—but too many of my contemporaries sort of had the attitude of, "Well, I know that this is the way the industry has always been run, but surely that doesn't apply to me." And I would say, "Well, yes, it does. It applies to everybody. So we're going to have to change the rules for everybody, not just say 'Well, this shouldn't apply to me because I'm so special.'" In 1982, during a panel discussion at the Dallas Fantasy Fair, Byrne made disparaging comments about longtime comics writer and one-time Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Roy Thomas that were published in The Comics Journal #75 (Sept. 1982). Thomas threatened a slander suit if Byrne did not apologize. In a letter printed in The Comics Journal #82 (July 1983), Byrne retracted his statements, saying he was only repeating information from others, writing, "I acted only in the office of a parrot." In 2005, criticizing portrayals of Superman emphasizing his connection to his home planet, Byrne described immigrants with what he perceives as excessive attachment to their nations of origin as "ungrateful little shits." These views were earlier expressed in Byrne's The Man of Steel (1986), in which Superman is not considered born until his Kryptonian artificial matrix opens after landing in Kansas, thus making him an American citizen by birth. The miniseries ends with Superman declaring, "Krypton bred me, but it was Earth that gave me all I am. All that matters." In 2015, Byrne received criticism for stating that transgender people are mentally ill and comparing them to pedophiles while discussing Caitlyn Jenner. Byrne stated: "How will we feel about all those people who, instead of actually helping them, we encouraged in a program of self-mutilation?"  Art style Byrne has himself called his style a "collection of influences". He cites Neal Adams, Jack Kirby, John Buscema, and Steve Ditko as primary influences on his style, but continues to pick up on ideas that he sees and likes while constantly changing his tools and methods. Byrne is color blind for a narrow range of green and brown tones. During the first year that Byrne illustrated Iron Fist, he believed that the protagonist's costume was brown. While he experimented with his own hand-drawn lettering in the early 1980s, he developed computer fonts for his work in the 1990s, one in particular based on the handwriting of the letterer Jack Morelli.  Personal life Byrne became a naturalized American citizen in 1988. He previously was a citizen of England and Canada, but no longer holds citizenship for those countries. He was married to photographer and actress Andrea Braun Byrne until divorcing. They met at a convention in Chicago. Braun's son from a previous marriage is fellow professional comic book artist Kieron Dwyer, and Byrne became Dwyer's stepfather when the boy was 13 until Byrne divorced his mother. They only lived together for a short time as the young Dwyer soon moved to Los Angeles to live with his father. Byrne encouraged Dwyer's aspirations to be a cartoonist and assisted in landing Dwyer's first professional job drawing Batman #413 (Nov. 1987). Byrne has described his political views as right-leaning, "There's a political party—or used to be—up in Canada called the Progressive Conservatives. And I always liked the sound of that name. I liked what that imparted, that sort of 'let us go forward carefully' notion. So that's sort of how I've always thought of myself, as a progressive conservative." Byrne has never done drugs and only drinks alcohol very sparingly. Since 2015, Byrne no longer attends any conventions regularly and makes rare public appearances. He made an exceptional appearance at the 2018 Fan Expo Boston, where he spoke at two events, both titled "Spotlight on John Byrne" on August 11 and 12, and an autograph signing with William Shatner.  Awards Byrne received the Favourite Comic Book Artist Eagle Awards in 1978 and 1979, and a 1980 Inkpot Award. In 2008, Byrne was inducted into the Canadian Comic Book Creator Hall of Fame. In 2015, Byrne was inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame, alongside judges' choices Marge (Marjorie Henderson Buell) and Bill Woggon and elected inductees Chris Claremont, Denis Kitchen, and Frank Miller.

Japanese Americans (Japanese: 日系アメリカ人) are Americans of Japanese ancestry. Japanese Americans were among the three largest Asian American ethnic communities during the 20th century; but, according to the 2000 census, they have declined in ranking to constitute the sixth largest Asian American group at around 1,469,637, including those of partial ancestry. According to the 2010 census, the largest Japanese American communities were found in California with 272,528, Hawaii with 185,502, New York with 37,780, Washington with 35,008, Illinois with 17,542 and Ohio with 16,995. Southern California has the largest Japanese American population in North America and the city of Gardena holds the densest Japanese American population in the 48 contiguous states.  History Immigration People from Japan began migrating to the US in significant numbers following the political, cultural, and social changes stemming from the Meiji Restoration in 1868. These early Issei immigrants came primarily from small towns and rural areas in the southern Japanese prefectures of Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Kumamoto, and Fukuoka and most of them settled in either Hawaii or along the West Coast. The Japanese population in the United States grew from 148 in 1880 (mostly students) to 2,039 in 1890 and 24,326 by 1900. In the earliest years of the 20th century, American officials with no experience in "transliterating...Japanese" often gave Japanese-Americans new names before and during the process of their naturalization.  In 1907, the Gentlemen's Agreement between the governments of Japan and the United States ended immigration of Japanese unskilled workers, but permitted the immigration of businessmen, students and spouses of Japanese immigrants already in the US. Prior to the Gentlemen's Agreement, about seven out of eight ethnic Japanese in the continental United States were men. By 1924, the ratio had changed to approximately four women to every six men. Japanese immigration to the U.S. effectively ended when Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924 which banned all but a token few Japanese people. The earlier Naturalization Act of 1790 restricted naturalized United States citizenship to free white persons, which excluded the Issei from citizenship. As a result, the Issei were unable to vote and faced additional restrictions such as the inability to own land under many state laws. Due to these restrictions, Japanese immigration to the United States between 1931 and 1950 only totaled 3,503 which is strikingly low compared to the totals of 46,250 people in 1951–1960, 39,988 in 1961–70, 49,775 in 1971–80, 47,085 in 1981–90, and 67,942 in 1991–2000. Because no new immigrants from Japan were permitted after 1924, almost all pre-World War II Japanese Americans born after this time were born in the United States. This generation, the Nisei, became a distinct cohort from the Issei generation in terms of age, citizenship, and English-language ability, in addition to the usual generational differences. Institutional and interpersonal racism led many of the Nisei to marry other Nisei, resulting in a third distinct generation of Japanese Americans, the Sansei. Significant Japanese immigration did not occur again until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 ended 40 years of bans against immigration from Japan and other countries. In the last few decades, immigration from Japan has been more like that from Europe. The numbers involve on average 5 to 10 thousand per year, and is similar to the amount of immigration to the US from Germany. This is in stark contrast to the rest of Asia, where better opportunity of life is the primary impetus for immigration.  Internment and redress During World War II, an estimated 120,000 Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals or citizens residing on the West Coast of the United States were forcibly interned in ten different camps across the Western United States. The internment was based on the race or ancestry, rather than the activities of the interned. Families, including children, were interned together. and 5,000 were able to "voluntarily" relocate outside the exclusion zone;  In 1948, the Evacuation Claims Act provided some compensation for property losses, but the act required documentation that many former inmates had lost during their removal and excluded lost opportunities, wages or interest from its calculations. Less than 24,000 filed a claim, and most received only a fraction of the losses they claimed. Four decades later, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 officially acknowledged the "fundamental violations of the basic civil liberties and constitutional rights" of the internment. Many Japanese Americans consider the term internment camp a euphemism and prefer to refer to the forced relocation of Japanese Americans as imprisonment in concentration camps. Webster's New World Fourth College Edition defines a concentration camp: "A prison camp in which political dissidents, members of minority ethnic groups, etc. are confined."  Cultural profile Generations The nomenclature for each of their generations who are citizens or long-term residents of countries other than Japan, used by Japanese Americans and other nationals of Japanese descent are explained here; they are formed by combining one of the Japanese numbers corresponding to the generation with the Japanese word for generation (sei 世). The Japanese American communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like Issei, Nisei, and Sansei, which describe the first, second, and third generations of immigrants. The fourth generation is called Yonsei (四世), and the fifth is called Gosei (五世). The term Nikkei (日系) encompasses Japanese immigrants in all countries and of all generations.  The kanreki (還暦), a pre-modern Japanese rite of passage to old age at 60, is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of Japanese American Nisei. Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values; and this traditional Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.  Languages Issei and many nisei speak Japanese in addition to English as a second language. In general, later generations of Japanese Americans speak English as their first language, though some do learn Japanese later as a second language. In Hawaii however, where Nikkei are about one-fifth of the whole population, Japanese is a major language, spoken and studied by many of the state's residents across ethnicities. It is taught in private Japanese language schools as early as the second grade. As a courtesy to the large number of Japanese tourists (from Japan), Japanese characters are provided on place signs, public transportation, and civic facilities. The Hawaii media market has a few locally produced Japanese language newspapers and magazines, although these are on the verge of dying out, due to a lack of interest on the part of the local (Hawaii-born) Japanese population. Stores that cater to the tourist industry often have Japanese-speaking personnel. To show their allegiance to the US, many nisei and sansei intentionally avoided learning Japanese. But as many of the later generations find their identities in both Japan and America or American society broadens its definition of cultural identity, studying Japanese is becoming more popular than it once was.  Education Japanese American culture places great value on education and culture. Across generations, children are often instilled with a strong desire to enter the rigors of higher education. In 1966, sociologist William Petersen (who coined the term "Model Minority") wrote that Japanese Americans "have established this remarkable record, moreover, by their own almost totally unaided effort. Every attempt to hamper their progress resulted only in enhancing their determination to succeed." The 2000 census reported that 40.8% of Japanese Americans held a college degree.  Schools for Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals A Japanese school opened in Hawaii in 1893 and other Japanese schools for temporary settlers in North America followed. In the years prior to World War II, many second generation Japanese American attended the American school by day and the Japanese school in the evening to keep up their Japanese skill as well as English. Other first generation Japanese American parents were worried that their child might go through the same discrimination when going to school so they gave them the choice to either go back to Japan to be educated, or to stay in America with their parents and study both languages. Anti-Japanese sentiment during World War I resulted in public efforts to close Japanese-language schools. The 1927 Supreme Court case Farrington v. Tokushige protected the Japanese American community's right to have Japanese language private institutions. During the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II many Japanese schools were closed. After the war many Japanese schools reopened. There are primary school-junior high school Japanese international schools within the United States. Some are classified as nihonjin gakkō or Japanese international schools operated by Japanese associations, and some are classified as Shiritsu zaigai kyōiku shisetsu (私立在外教育施設) or overseas branches of Japanese private schools. They are: Seigakuin Atlanta International School, Chicago Futabakai Japanese School, Japanese School of Guam, Nishiyamato Academy of California near Los Angeles, Japanese School of New Jersey, and New York Japanese School. A boarding senior high school, Keio Academy of New York, is near New York City. It is a Shiritsu zaigai kyōiku shisetsu. There are also supplementary Japanese educational institutions (hoshū jugyō kō) that hold Japanese classes on weekends. They are located in several US cities. The supplementary schools target Japanese nationals and second-generation Japanese Americans living in the United States. There are also Japanese heritage schools for third generation and beyond Japanese Americans. Rachel Endo of Hamline University, the author of "Realities, Rewards, and Risks of Heritage-Language Education: Perspectives from Japanese Immigrant Parents in a Midwestern Community," wrote that the heritage schools "generally emphasize learning about Japanese American historical experiences and Japanese culture in more loosely defined terms". Tennessee Meiji Gakuin High School (shiritsu zaigai kyōiku shisetsu) and International Bilingual School (unapproved by the Japanese Ministry of Education or MEXT) were full-time Japanese schools that were formerly in existence.  Religion Japanese Americans practice a wide range of religions, including Mahayana Buddhism (Jōdo Shinshū, Jōdo-shū, Nichiren, Shingon, and Zen forms), Shinto, and Christianity (usually Protestant or Catholic, being their majority faith as per recent data). In many ways, due to the longstanding nature of Buddhist and Shinto practices in Japanese society, many of the cultural values and traditions commonly associated with Japanese tradition have been strongly influenced by these religious forms.  A large number of the Japanese American community continue to practice Buddhism in some form, and a number of community traditions and festivals continue to center around Buddhist institutions. For example, one of the most popular community festivals is the annual Obon Festival, which occurs in the summer, and provides an opportunity to reconnect with their customs and traditions and to pass these traditions and customs to the young. These kinds of festivals are mostly popular in communities with large populations of Japanese Americans, such as Southern California and Hawaii. A reasonable number of Japanese people both in and out of Japan are secular, as Shinto and Buddhism are most often practiced by rituals such as marriages or funerals, and not through faithful worship, as defines religion for many Americans. Most Japanese Americans now practice Christianity. Among mainline denominations the Presbyterians have long been active. The First Japanese Presbyterian Church of San Francisco opened in 1885. Los Angeles Holiness Church was founded by six Japanese men and women in 1921. There is also the Japanese Evangelical Missionary Society (JEMS) formed in the 1950s. It operates Asian American Christian Fellowships (AACF) programs on university campuses, especially in California. The Japanese language ministries are fondly known as "Nichigo" in Japanese American Christian communities. The newest trend includes Asian American members who do not have a Japanese heritage.  Celebrations An important annual festival for Japanese Americans is the Obon Festival, which happens in July or August of each year. Across the country, Japanese Americans gather on fair grounds, churches and large civic parking lots and commemorate the memory of their ancestors and their families through folk dances and food. Carnival booths are usually set up so Japanese American children have the opportunity to play together. Japanese American celebrations tend to be more sectarian in nature and focus on the community-sharing aspects.  Politics Japanese Americans have shown strong support for Democratic candidates in recent elections. Shortly prior to the 2004 US presidential election, Japanese Americans narrowly favored Democrat John Kerry by a 42% to 38% margin over Republican George W. Bush. In the 2008 US presidential election, the National Asian American Survey found that Japanese Americans favored Democrat Barack Obama by a 62% to 16% margin over Republican John McCain, while 22% were still undecided. In the 2012 presidential election, a majority of Japanese Americans (70%) voted for Barack Obama. In the 2016 presidential election, majority of Japanese Americans (74%) voted for Hillary Clinton. In pre-election surveys for the 2020 presidential election, 61% to 72% of Japanese Americans planned to vote for Joe Biden.  Cuisine Circa 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan) calculated that people of Japanese ancestry operated about 10% of the Japanese restaurants in the United States; this was because salaries were relatively high in Japan and few cooks of Japanese cuisine had motivations to move to the United States. This meant Americans and immigrants of other ethnic origins, including Chinese Americans, opened restaurants serving Japanese style cuisine.  Genetics Risk for inherited diseases Studies have looked into the risk factors that are more prone to Japanese Americans, specifically in hundreds of family generations of Nisei (The generation of people born in North America, Philippines, Latin America, Hawaii, or any country outside Japan either to at least one Issei or one non-immigrant Japanese parent) second-generation pro-bands (A person serving as the starting point for the genetic study of a family, used in medicine and psychiatry). The risk factors for genetic diseases in Japanese Americans include coronary heart disease and diabetes. One study, called the Japanese American Community Diabetes Study that started in 1994 and went through 2003, involved the pro-bands taking part to test whether the increased risk of diabetes among Japanese Americans is due to the effects of Japanese Americans having a more westernized lifestyle due to the many differences between the United States of America and Japan. One of the main goals of the study was to create an archive of DNA samples which could be used to identify which diseases are more susceptible in Japanese Americans. Concerns with these studies of the risks of inherited diseases in Japanese Americans is that information pertaining to the genetic relationship may not be consistent with the reported biological family information given of Nisei second generation pro-bands. Also, research has been put on concerning apolipoprotein E genotypes; this polymorphism has three alleles (*e2, *e3, and *e4) and was determined from research because of its known association with increased cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease in Japanese Americans. Specifically too, the apolipoprotein *e4 allele is linked to Alzheimer's disease as well. Also, there is increased coronary heart disease in Japanese American men with a mutation in the cholesterol ester transfer protein gene despite having increased levels of HDL. By definition, HDL are plasma high density lipoproteins that show a genetic relationship with coronary heart disease (CHD). The cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) helps the transfer of cholesterol esters from lipoproteins to other lipoproteins in the human body. It plays a fundamental role in the reverse transport of cholesterol to the liver, which is why a mutation in this can lead to coronary heart disease. Studies have shown that the CETP is linked to increased HDL levels. There is a very common pattern of two different cholesterol ester transfer protein gene mutations (D442G, 5.1%; intron 14G:A, 0.5%) found in about 3,469 Japanese American men. This was based on a program called the Honolulu Heart Program. The mutations correlated with decreased CETP levels (-35%) and increased HDL cholesterol levels (+10% for D442G). The relative risk of CHD was 1.43 in men with mutations (P<0.05), and after research found for CHD risk factors, the relative risk went up to 1.55 (P=0.02); after further adjustments for HDL levels, the relative risk went up again to 1.68 (P=0.008). Genetic CETP deficiency is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, which is due mainly to increased CHD risks in Japanese American men with the D442G mutation and lipoprotein cholesterol levels between 41 and 60 mg/dl. With research and investigations, the possibility of finding "bad genes" denounces the Japanese Americans and will be associated only with Japanese American ancestry, leading to other issues the Japanese Americans had to deal with in the past such as discrimination and prejudice.  Japanese Americans by state California In the early 1900s, Japanese Americans established fishing communities on Terminal Island and in San Diego. By 1923, there were two thousand Japanese fishermen sailing out of Los Angeles Harbor. By the 1930s, legislation was passed that attempted to limit Japanese fishermen. Still, areas such as San Francisco's Japantown managed to thrive. Due to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, historically Japanese areas fell into disrepair or became adopted by other minority groups (in the case of Black and Latino populations in Little Tokyo). Boats owned by Japanese Americans were confiscated by the U.S. Navy. One of the vessels owned by a Japanese American, the Alert, built in 1930, became YP-264 in December 1941, and was finally struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 2014. When Japanese Americans returned from internment, many settled in neighborhoods where they set up their own community centers in order to feel accepted. Today, many have been renamed cultural centers and focus on the sharing of Japanese culture with local community members, especially in the sponsorship of Obon festivals. The city of Torrance in Greater Los Angeles has headquarters of Japanese automakers and offices of other Japanese companies. Because of the abundance of Japanese restaurants and other cultural offerings are in the city, and Willy Blackmore of L.A. Weekly wrote that Torrance was "essentially Japan's 48th prefecture".  Colorado From the early 20th century, Japanese immigrants to the state often came from rural parts of Japan and the "prosperous Aichi Prefecture". There were roughly 11,000 people of Japanese heritage in Colorado as of 2005. The history up until 2005 was covered in the book Colorado's Japanese Americans: From 1886 to the Present by award-winning author and journalist Bill Hosokawa. One of the first documented was engineer Tadaatsu Matsudaira who moved there for health reasons in 1886. The Granada Relocation Center which incarcerated more than 10,000 Japanese Americans from 1942 to 1945, was designated as part of the National Park System on March 18, 2022, and is located in southeastern Colorado. Colorado is also home to several rural farms, many multi-generational dating back to the end of World War II, owned by people of Japanese ancestry.  Connecticut Two supplementary Japanese language schools are located in Connecticut, each educating the local Japanese population. The Japanese School of New York is located in Greenwich, Connecticut in Greater New York City; it had formerly been located in New York City. There is also the Japanese Language School of Greater Hartford, located in Hartford, Connecticut.  Georgia The Seigakuin Atlanta International School is located in Peachtree Corners in Greater Atlanta.  Hawaii Illinois As of 2011 there is a Japanese community in Arlington Heights, near Chicago. Jay Shimotake, the president of the Mid America Japanese Club, an organization located in Arlington Heights, said "Arlington Heights is a very convenient location, and Japanese people in the business environment know it's a nice location surrounding O'Hare airport." The Chicago Futabakai Japanese School is located in Arlington Heights. The Mitsuwa Marketplace, a shopping center owned by Japanese, opened around 1981. Many Japanese companies have their US headquarters in nearby Hoffman Estates and Schaumburg.  Massachusetts There is a Japanese School of Language in Medford. Another, the Amherst Japanese Language School, is in South Hadley, in the 5-college area of the western part of the state. Most Japanese Americans in the state live in Greater Boston, with a high concentration in the town of Brookline. Porter Square, Cambridge has a Japanese-cultural district and shopping plaza.  Michigan As of April 2013, the largest Japanese national population in Michigan is in Novi, with 2,666 Japanese residents, and the next largest populations are respectively in Ann Arbor, West Bloomfield Township, Farmington Hills, and Battle Creek. The state has 481 Japanese employment facilities providing 35,554 local jobs. 391 of them are in Southeast Michigan, providing 20,816 jobs, and the 90 in other regions in the state provide 14,738 jobs. The Japanese Direct Investment Survey of the Consulate-General of Japan, Detroit stated that over 2,208 more Japanese residents were employed in the State of Michigan as of October 1, 2012, than had been in 2011.  Missouri Many Japanese Americans in Missouri live in the St. Louis area and are the descendants of those who were previously interned in camps such as one in Arkansas.  New Jersey As of March 2011 about 2,500 Japanese Americans combined live in Edgewater and Fort Lee; this is the largest concentration of Japanese Americans in the state. The New Jersey Japanese School is located in Oakland. Paramus Catholic High School hosts a weekend Japanese school, and Englewood Cliffs has a Japanese school.  Other smaller Japanese American populations are also located in the remainder of Bergen County and other parts of the state. Mitsuwa Marketplace has a location in Edgewater that also houses a mini shopping complex.  New York Oklahoma The 1990 census recorded 2,385 Japanese Americans in Oklahoma. Historically, they lived in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Bartlesville, and Ponca City and none were interned during World War II.  Oregon Rhode Island Rhode Island is the only state celebrating Victory Over Japan Day (V-J Day) as a holiday. Every year, the holiday is observed on the second Monday in August. It has been claimed that this holiday is racially-based and negatively affects Japanese American citizens in RI and other states in the U.S., ignoring traumas caused by the history of the internment camp and deaths of between 129,000 and 226,000 civilians and lasting radiation poisoning due to the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is reported that in Rhode Island, some Japanese "are uncomfortable leaving their homes on Victory Day because they fear violence."  Virginia There are about 5,500 Japanese Americans in Northern Virginia, representing the majority of Japanese Americans in the state and the multi-state Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. A small, but relatively high number of Japanese Americans can be found areas surrounding the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech.

The Guttenberg National Fish Hatchery and Aquarium Historic District is a nationally recognized historic district located in Guttenberg, Iowa, United States.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.  At the time of its nomination the district consisted of four resources, all of which are contributing buildings.  This district also contributes to the Front Street (River Park Drive) Historic District.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had a long history of involvement with wildlife conservation in Iowa, especially fisheries.  They established fish rescue program along the Mississippi River in 1903 and a research station at Fairport in 1910.  The development of the lock and dam system in the 1930s brought the fish rescue operations to an end because they eliminated of the backwaters that trapped them. The fish hatchery was developed at that time. Property for the facility was donated by the City of Guttenberg and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.  Construction of the hatchery and aquarium building, the superintendent's residence, and a garage were begun in 1938 and completed in 1939 by the Public Works Administration.  The pump house was completed a year later.  The fish rearing ponds on Twelve Mile Island were built by the Works Progress Administration from  1939 to 1941. The fish reared in the ponds were distributed to lakes, rivers, and ponds in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Nebraska, and South Dakota.  They also supplied specimen fish to the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago; the National Aquarium in Washington, D.C.; aquariums in Dallas, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia; the Fish Control Laboratory in La Crosse, Wisconsin; as well as several university research laboratories.  The ponds were closed and transferred to the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge in 1971.  The rest of the facility was transferred to the State of Iowa in 1974, and it acquired the titles to the properties from the federal government in 1986.   == References ==

Kolibri is a shooting game created exclusively for the Sega 32X, a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis add-on console. It was designed by Ed Annunziata and developed by Novotrade (now known as Appaloosa). Kolibri is the word or root word for hummingbird in several European languages.  Gameplay The game offers numerous power-ups for the player's kolibri. Each one follows different patterns. Some are spread shots and others will home in on an enemy. This game also features a good number of puzzles which grow increasingly difficult with each level.  Plot Long ago, a crystal from outer space embedded itself in the earth and started creating life. Soon another similar crystal crashed to earth and started to destroy what the first crystal had created and started to sap away its strength. Before being totally destroyed the crystal gave a lone hummingbird its power. It is up to this hummingbird to save the earth.  Reception Kolibri received mostly middling reviews. Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the game's impressive visuals and originality, but highly criticized how the game restarts the player character in a highly vulnerable position each time it dies. Scary Larry of GamePro concurred that the visuals are impressive, but was not convinced of the game's originality, remarking that "Although the concept is unique, the gameplay and FunFactor are standard." He also commented that the power-ups look weak, needing to manually turn the bird around to shoot enemies behind him is cumbersome and frustrating, and the bird often gets lost in the backgrounds. He concluded, "Kolibri isn't awful, just average. You'd expect more from the 32X—something more along the lines of Gradius or R-Type." A reviewer for Next Generation said the game doesn't have anything which couldn't have been done on the stock Genesis and suffers from "very monotonous" gameplay, though he saved most of his criticism for the "absurd" premise: "Trying to remember why you bought that 32X? Well, Sega is hoping you've been waiting for the ultimate hummingbird simulation game. That's right, in Kolibri you are a hummingbird (not even a wisecracking, zany hummingbird with an attitude, just a hummingbird) and you fly around toasting insects with the guided missile on your beak." Sega Saturn Magazine commented, "Large and complex, Kolibri offers value for money, but a certain dullness and insipidity accompanies it." Italian magazine Mega Console criticized the controls and music, but praised the graphics and parallax, yet giving the game a near-perfect score of 99. In 2001, webcomic Penny Arcade lampooned the game in their 25th anniversary "We're Right Awards," calling it the "Best Hummingbird-based Shooter Available For The 32X."

The Auburn Doubledays are a collegiate summer baseball team of the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League (PGCBL) that is located in Auburn, New York. From 1958 to 2020, they were members of Minor League Baseball's New York–Penn League (NYPL). They have played their home games at Leo Pinckney Field at Falcon Park since 1995. They previously played at the original Falcon Park, which was built in 1927 on the same site. The team is owned and operated by Auburn Community Baseball. Auburn began in the NYPL in 1958 and has since competed under various names and served as the farm team for a number of Major League Baseball teams. The Doubledays and its mascot, Abner, are named for Abner Doubleday, the Civil War general and Auburn native apocryphally credited with inventing the game of baseball. Abner wears number 96 in honor of the birth of the team in 1996. With Major League Baseball's reorganization of the minor leagues after the 2020 season, Auburn was not selected to continue in affiliated baseball; they signed a deal to become members of the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League (PGCBL) starting in 2021.  History Early championship era In 1958, the Auburn New York–Penn League franchise was founded as the Auburn Yankees, as an affiliate of the New York Yankees. The Yankees affiliation lasted until 1961. The club included future Major League Baseball All-Stars Jim Bouton, Joe Pepitone, and Mel Stottlemyre. The team then became affiliated with the New York Mets, as the Auburn Mets. With a roster that included Billy Wynne, Don Shaw, Tug McGraw, and Jerry Koosman, the club won the league championship three times: in 1962, 1964, and 1966. In 1967, the club changed its affiliation to the Minnesota Twins and became the Auburn Twins. The Twins won NYPL title in 1967 and 1970. In 1972, the team was renamed the Auburn Phillies after associating with the Philadelphia Phillies. In 1973, under manager Harry Lloyd, the team won league championship. Future major leaguers Luis Aguayo, Randy Lerch, Dickie Noles, Lonnie Smith, and Ozzie Virgil, among numerous others, played for the team. Managers of note included Mike Compton and Ruben Amaro.  Co-op seasons In 1978, the team became the Auburn Sunsets and were co-operated by the Phillies and Houston Astros. Managed by Dick Rockwell, the team went achieved a 32–40 record, finishing third in the league's Yawkey Division. The team featured future major league players Carmelo Castillo and Alejandro Sanchez and future major league general manager Dave Littlefield. In 1979 the club became known as the Auburn Red Stars. The team featured future MLB player Doug Frobel. The Red Stars operated under a co-operative agreement. The Red Stars received players from seven different major league organizations, led by the Detroit Tigers, with seven players, and Cleveland Indians, with five. In 1980, the Red Stars changed their name to the Auburn Americans. The team once again operated as a co-op and received 17 players from the Cleveland Indians and several from the Los Angeles Dodgers. The squad featured future MLB player Jack Fimple and finished fourth in the New York–Penn League's West Division with a 29–45 record.  Astros era Auburn returned to play in the New York–Penn League in 1982 with the Auburn Astros as an affiliate of the Houston Astros. In 1991, with John H. Graham as general manager, the team set the all-time attendance record at Falcon Park.  Doubledays The team was renamed the Auburn Doubledays before the 1996 season and has operated under that name since. In 1998, the Doubledays and the Oneonta Yankees were named co-champions of the New York–Penn League after Central New York was hit with a torrential rain storm and the fields at both parks were deemed unplayable. Under the management of Dennis Holmberg, the Doubledays won the Pinckney Division title for six straight years in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, but failed to win the league championship for the first five of those years. After losing in the first round of the playoffs for the first three years of their streak, they advanced to the New York–Penn League championship series before being swept by the Staten Island Yankees. In 2003, the Doubledays led all of baseball in winning percentage (.757). The Doubledays finally won the NYPL title in 2007, sweeping the Brooklyn Cyclones in the league championship series. The final game featured a stellar pitching performance by Brett Cecil and a home run by J. P. Arencibia. This was the first league championship for the city of Auburn since 1973. After the cancelled 2020 minor league season, Major League Baseball took direct control of Minor League Baseball and discontinued short-season play. The Doubledays were not among the four teams invited to remain as full-season affiliates of the Washington Nationals, with whom they had been affiliated since 2011. The city and the team's ownership group are exploring options such as independent baseball or collegiate summer baseball for 2021.

Muslim Community Center Academy (MCCA) is a Muslim K-12 school in the Chicago metropolitan area and in Illinois. Pre-Kindergarten and elementary school students attend classes in Skokie while secondary grades are in Morton Grove.  History The school purchased land for a single campus in Morton Grove in 1989. The school described 1989 as its year of establishment. The school began operations in August of the following year. It initially had grades Kindergarten through 2. 25 students were enrolled when the school opened. At first the school had seven principals before 2002, and that year its enrollment count was 175. In 2002 Habeeb Quadri, the son of the founder of the MCC organization, became the principal. He later became the superintendent. For a period of time the school had grades K-8 only, partly because since 2004, the government of Morton Grove did not permit the institution to add high school.  In early 2014 the school had 50 employees and 476 students. In 2014 Skokie School District 68 sold MCC a school building that was previously a private Jewish day school, Solomon Schechter Day School, and the Kenton School. That year MCC moved its elementary school students to that campus. In 2018 MCCA had 129 students at the middle school level. That year, the Morton Grove government agreed to lift the restrictions on high school students, with new rules allowing up to 25 high school students to enter each year.

One Voice (styled as One Vo1ce) is a Filipino-American R&B girl group that originated from Vallejo, California. The group is known for their 1999 single "When U Think About Me".  Career 1996-98: Formation The girls of One Voice met while they were in elementary school. They originally started out as a quintet, which at the time included Aimee Castillo (no relation to Monica), and another original member named Lindsay Mangoba, but before anything was recorded she later left the group and was replaced by Melissa Ruiz. The girls eventually landed a record deal with Kamikaze Records (an independent label) in 1998, and contracted the talent of producer James Earley.  1999-2000: Just The Beginning Recording their debut album was tough. The girls wanted it to be just right and they had to make up their minds about what kind of album they wanted to record. First they hired the right producer, multi-platinum producer James "Jae-E" Earley, who wrote and/or produced the majority of the first album. Then, they chose an urban-pop/OPM sound. The group released their first single "All Day All Nite" in October of 1998, it failed to chart. The group released their debut album Just the Beginning on April 20, 1999. Their second single "When U Think About Me" was released to radio stations across the United States and it became their most successful single to date. It peaked at #17 on the US Rhythmic Top 40 chart and #96 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The song was also featured in an original MTV movie called Jailbait.  The song was covered by singer Billy Crawford in 2002, where it became a hit in Europe. Due to the success of "When U Think About Me", their album was re-released a year later. The album sold 100,000 copies worldwide and it was certified gold. Two more singles were released from their debut album "Boyfriend", and "Never Leave Your Side", however both songs failed to chart.  2001-02: Lineup change and Sincerely Yours When promotion on Just The Beginning was over, the girls were ready to record their second album. They knew that they would have to show their growth. During this time, Aimee had left the group. The group was hurt by her departure. Even though she left the group, they remained close friends. The group began the recording process of their second album without Aimee. It took another two years but Sincerely Yours was released on June 26, 2001. It was not as successful as their debut album. The album only sold 45,000 copies worldwide and reviews of the album were mixed. Only two singles were released from the album, but both "Swing Your Love 2 Me" and "So Badd" failed to chart. The girls left the Kamikaze label the following year.  2003-05: Luvin' You and disbandment The girls took a little break off to live life. They signed with another independent label, Straight Hits Entertainment. Before the release of their third album, they released a self-titled EP giving fans a sneak peek of their upcoming album. Their third album, Luvin' You, was eventually released on January 27, 2004. It became their most successful album to date, selling 150,000 copies worldwide. Despite being their most successful album, no singles have been released from the album. The group would split in 2005.  2009–present: Reunion In summer 2009, after a five-year hiatus, One Voice decided to make their return into the music industry. They went back into the studio to record new music and began performing at various events. The group also announced the return of original member, Aimee Castillo. One Vo1ce appeared at the 15th Annual Filipino-American (Fil-Am) Friendship Celebration at the Serramonte Shopping Center, Daly City, CA on September 20, 2009. It was there where they revealed their new single, "Time To Live Your Life". Aimee and Melissa would later leave the group and they would remain a trio. The group announced that they would release new material and released a new single called "Passion", on July 11, 2019. On July 23, 2021, the trio would release their 4th studio album ISO, which contained the singles "What If", "Friendster", "Joy & Disgust", "Astro 101", and "Trapeze".

"A Sort of Homecoming" is a song by Irish rock band U2, and is the opening track on their 1984 album, The Unforgettable Fire. A live version of the track is found on 1985's four-track EP, Wide Awake in America.  Composition As the opening track on The Unforgettable Fire, "A Sort of Homecoming" epitomises the new direction U2 had taken. A far more atmospheric album than the previous overt-rock of War, the album has a rich and orchestrated sound. Like much of the album, the song replaces the hard-hitting martial drum sound of War with a subtler polyrhythmic shuffle, and the guitar is no longer as prominent in the mix. On the War Tour and leading up to recording The Unforgettable Fire, U2 lead singer and lyricist, Bono, had become a voracious reader. He read fiction, philosophy and poetry, and came to realise that his song-writing mission—which up to that point had been a reluctant one on his behalf—was a poetic one. He read works of poet Paul Celan, whose line "poetry is a sort of homecoming" inspired not just the song's title but the song itself. Celan's profound spiritual doubt contrasts with U2 members' previous religious certainties. The song's line "on borderlands we run...and don't look back" suggests the band had become more comfortable with the contradictions between rock and religious beliefs in comparison to during the October-War period. The phrase, "poetry is a sort of homecoming" had additional significance for Bono as a singer who was constantly away from home and travelling. According to guitarist The Edge in a 1984 interview, producer Daniel Lanois made a reference mix of the instrumental whilst recording the backing track which was difficult to match whilst recording the vocals, hence the vocals were bounced on top of the existing rough mix. According to bassist Adam Clayton, Bono's vocals for the song were re-recorded at the last minute. The band had worked overnight to finish The Unforgettable Fire by 8 a.m. on the final day of the recording sessions so Lanois could deliver the tapes for mastering. As they listened back to the song, Bono said that he wanted to record another take of his vocals. With his taxi to the airport waiting outside, Lanois relented and cued up the tapes, allowing Bono one final take. Lanois told the band that he would mix it at the mastering studio in London and then departed. "A Sort of Homecoming" is in the key of D. The song has a tempo of 118 beats per minute.  Video A film of U2 on tour in Northern Europe in October–November 1984 was made to accompany a live version  of the song, which was used as a television video to promote The Unforgettable Fire album, showing the band on the road travelling through London, in France and the Low Countries, and in performance at several venues, including the Westfalenhalle in Dortmund, West Germany, returning across the North Sea by ferry boat to the British Isles at the song's conclusion.  Influence Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin wrote for Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time  the section on U2, saying: "I don't buy weekend tickets to Ireland and hang out in front of their gates, but U2 are the only band whose entire catalogue I know by heart. The first song on The Unforgettable Fire, "A Sort of Homecoming", I know backward and forward—it's so rousing, brilliant and beautiful. It's one of the first songs I played to my unborn baby." Pearl Jam have covered the song on numerous occasions with lead singer Eddie Vedder often playing it by himself on guitar.  Live performances The live premiere of "A Sort of Homecoming" came during The Unforgettable Fire Tour on 17 September 1984. When played live, the song would start with just The Edge playing while Bono sang. After the first verse, the rest of the band would join in.  It was performed regularly on the rest of The Unforgettable Fire Tour, typically after "The Electric Co.", and was played occasionally on the first two legs of the next tour, The Joshua Tree Tour. It was dropped from the band's live set on 27 June 1987 and did not reappear again until the second leg of the Elevation Tour in 2001. It was played live again for the first time in 14 years during the band's homecoming gig at Slane Castle in Ireland on 25 August 2001, however the performance didn't go well with Bono struggling to recall its original lyrical construction. It made only one more Elevation Tour appearance, when at a concert at the Oakland Arena on 16 November 2001 a fan was invited up on stage by the band to perform on an acoustic guitar, and he began playing the song impromptu. U2 played along but Bono's recollection of the lyrics was even worse than at the Slane Castle gig three months earlier, with him admitting as much mid-song to the audience, and he re-coursed to improvised word-play instead, during which he cited Van Morrison's work as a source of inspiration for the song originally. A Sort of Homecoming was not performed again until opening night of The Joshua Tree Tour 2017, where it has been performed occasionally in alternation with "Bad." A live version of the track is found on 1985's four-track EP, Wide Awake in America. It is also the only song with lyrics inside the sleeve for the album.

Novgorod (Russian: Новгород) was a monitor built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1870s. She was one of the most unusual warships ever constructed, and still survives in popular naval myth as one of the worst warships ever built. However, a more balanced assessment shows that she was relatively effective in her designed role as a coast-defence ship. The hull was circular to reduce draught while allowing the ship to carry much more armour and a heavier armament than other ships of the same size. Novgorod played a minor role in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 and was reclassified as a coast-defence ironclad in 1892. The ship was decommissioned in 1903 and used as a storeship until she was sold for scrap in 1911.  Background In 1868, the Scottish shipbuilder John Elder published an article that advocated that widening the beam of a ship would reduce the area that needed to be protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a ship with a narrower beam, as was the typical practice of the day. In addition such a ship would have a shallower draught and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the speed of a normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat-bottomed, unlike Elder's convex hull, to minimise its draught. Popov designed Novgorod to meet an 1869 requirement to defend the Dnieper-Bug Estuary and the Kerch Strait. The requirement was for four very heavily-armoured ships of 11-foot (3.4 m) draught and armed with 11-inch (279 mm) rifled guns, for which the total programme cost should not exceed four million rubles. The 2,100-long-ton (2,100 t) Charodeika-class monitor met all of the requirements except that their armament was not powerful enough, so General-Admiral Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich selected Popov's circular design in late December 1869. A model was built with a circular hull and performed well during tests in the Baltic Sea at St. Petersburg in April 1870; when Tsar Alexander II received reports of the trials, he nicknamed the ship a "popovka", a diminutive form of the designer's name. Popov submitted several designs to the General-Admiral who selected the largest of these for a ship that displaced 6,054 long tons (6,151 t), 151 feet (46.0 m) in diameter, and armed with four 11-inch guns on 7 June. This ironclad was estimated to cost 4.14 million rubles, more than the total cost of the entire programme, and Popov was forced to scale down his design. On 24 October, the Tsar approved his design for a ship 96 feet (29.3 m) in diameter, armed with two 11-inch guns, and protected by 12 inches (305 mm) of armour. It was estimated to cost 1.94 million roubles per ship and the total cost of the programme, including improvements to the shipyards, would cost 8.5 million rubles. For further testing, the Kambala (Flounder), a circular ship 24 feet (7.3 m) in diameter, was built in 1871. Equipped with two engines producing a total of 3,360 nominal horsepower, her trials during that summer were considered a success.  Description While under construction, Popov's design was modified by the addition of wood and copper sheathing to reduce biofouling, which increased Novgorod's diameter to 101 feet (30.8 m). She had a maximum draught of 13 feet 6 inches (4.1 m) and displaced 2,491 long tons (2,531 t) at normal load. Freeboard was only 18 inches (46 cm) and the deck curved upwards to the gun barbette in the center. The ship had an unarmoured superstructure forward of the barbette that housed some of the crew's quarters. Despite initial concerns about her sea-keeping ability, Novgorod was a stable gun platform and had an easy roll that rarely exceeded 7–8°. Her bluff hull form meant that she lost speed in heavy weather and, on one occasion in 1877, lost all headway during a Force eight storm. In some conditions the ship could pitch enough to lift her propellers out of the water. The biggest drawback to her hull shape was that it greatly reduced the rudder's ability to turn the ship by masking much of the flow of water so much that it took 40–45 minutes to make a full circle and the ship was almost unsteerable in a severe storm. The solution adopted was to use the engines for steering and leave the rudder fixed, even though this reduced the ship's speed. She had a crew of 151 officers and ratings. The ship had six horizontal compound-expansion steam engines built by the Baird Works, each driving a single propeller, using steam provided by eight cylindrical boilers. The engines produced a total of 3,360 indicated horsepower (2,510 kW) which gave her a speed of around 6.5 knots (12.0 km/h; 7.5 mph). Novgorod's propulsion machinery proved problematic throughout her life as a result of defective workmanship and poor-quality materials. Her blunt hull form was not conducive to efficient steaming and she proved to be a prodigious consumer of coal as her capacity of 200 long tons (200 t) only gave her range of 480 nautical miles (890 km; 550 mi) at full speed. The ship had ventilation problems throughout her career, despite later fitting a large ventilation cowl over the central hatch of the barbette. Novgorod was armed with two 28 cm L/20 M67. This was a 279 mm (11-inch) calibre rifled muzzle-loading gun that was 20 calibers long. The guns could penetrate 11 inches of armour at a range of 800 yards (730 m); their 489-pound (222 kg) shells had a muzzle velocity of 1,290 feet per second (392 m/s). Their rate of fire was very slow, about one round every 10 minutes. The guns were mounted on separate revolving turntables that could be moved independently or locked together. Each turntable took about two or three minutes to rotate 180°. Gunnery trials in November 1874 showed that the locks for the turntables were too weak; so much so that the gun's recoil could cause them to rotate, leading to the persistent myth that the whole ship rotated when a gun fired. Reinforcement of the locks solved the problem, but the myth persisted.  Protection The ship had a waterline belt of wrought iron that completely covered the hull and extended from 18 inches (457 mm) above the waterline to 4 feet 6 inches (1.4 m) below it. The armour was configured in two strakes, each 3 feet (0.9 m) high. The upper plates were 9 inches (229 mm) thick and the lower ones 7 inches (178 mm). The armour was backed by 9 inches of teak reinforced by interlocking channel irons. The navy considered this backing to be the equivalent of another 2 inches (51 mm) of armour. Novgorod was the first Russian ironclad to place her armament in a barbette mounting. It was 7 feet (2 m) high and was built in the same manner as the upper strake of the belt. The rounded deck was protected by a total of 2.75 inches (70 mm) of armour, made up of three layers of plates ranging in thickness from 0.75 to 1 inch (19 to 25 mm). The lower portion of the funnels and the base of the engine room skylight had armour plates 6 inches (152 mm) thick.  Construction and career The Treaty of Paris that ended the Crimean War of 1854–56 limited the Imperial Russian Navy to only six 800 long tons (810 t) corvettes in the Black Sea, so the royal shipyard in Sevastopol was leased to the Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company. This meant that any ironclads built for Black Sea service would have to be built in Saint Petersburg, disassembled, and then shipped to a port there for reassembly. The long-dormant facility at Nikolaev was chosen and the navy began ordering machinery and tools from Britain to re-equip the shipyard in 1870, when Russia abrogated those clauses of the treaty. A temporary slipway was built at the New Admiralty Shipyard in January 1871 and construction of Novgorod, named after the city, began on 13 April. Using two shifts to speed construction, her hull was completed by 29 December, when the official keel-laying ceremony was held. Within two weeks it was disassembled, and the first shipment of parts arrived at Nikolaev on 2 April 1872. Reassembly began on a specially-prepared slipway eight days later. As there was no rail line between Saint Petersburg and Nikolaev, the components had to be railed to Odessa, where they were transshipped onto river barges and steamers. The boilers were too large and had to be shipped by freighter from the Baltic Sea to Odessa for transshipment. Construction was delayed by late deliveries of parts and the workforce's lack of experience; the ship was finally launched on 2 June 1873, with Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich in attendance. Novgorod's guns were mounted in September, and she entered service the following year, at a cost of 2,830,000 rubles.  During the winter of 1873–74, a small superstructure was built aft of the barbette and an enclosed wheelhouse was built atop it. In addition, the shape of the forward superstructure was modified so that it overhung the bow, and prominent bridge wings were added. A telescoping boom for a spar torpedo was fitted at the same time. In 1875, the ship made a port visit to Taganrog, and hosted Sir Edward Reed during a cruise along the Crimean coast that October. During the Russo-Turkish War, she was assigned to the defense of Odessa, and her armament was reinforced by a pair of 4-pounder 3.4-inch (86 mm) guns mounted on her aft superstructure to protect her against torpedo boats. These guns fired a 12.7-pound (5.74 kg) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2,154 feet per second (657 m/s) to a range of 3,602 yards (3,294 m). During this time, the navy realized that the ship's outermost engines contributed little to her speed, and with steam capacity insufficient for all of her engines, the outer engines were removed in 1876–77. This reduced Novgorod's total power to 2,000 ihp (1,500 kW) and her speed to about 6 knots (11 km/h; 6.9 mph). The ship made a cruise to the Romanian town of Sulina on the Danube after the war, and she received armoured covers for her engine room skylight and the central barbette hatch to protect against plunging fire. In July 1879 she ran aground off Odessa and was damaged. Novgorod was stationed in Sevastopol throughout the 1880s and made short cruises every summer. She received the refurbished boilers from Vice Admiral Popov after that ship was reboilered in 1883. She was reclassified as a coast-defence ironclad on 13 February 1892, by which time her armament had been augmented by two 37-millimetre (1.5 in) quick-firing Hotchkiss five-barreled revolving cannon. These guns had a range of 3,038 yards (2,778 m) and a rate of fire of 32 rounds per minute. By the following year her hull and machinery were in poor condition. The ship was turned over to the Port Authority of Nikolaev for disposal on 1 May 1903 and stricken from the navy list on 3 July, after which she was used as a storeship. Novgorod was offered for sale to Bulgaria in 1908, but the offer was not taken up. The ship was sold for scrap in December 1911.  Myths and reality In his book, The World's Worst Warships, naval historian Antony Preston characterised the popovkas like this: But in other respects, they were a dismal failure. They were too slow to stem the current in the Dniepr, and proved very difficult to steer. In practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn out of control and even contra-rotating some of six propellers was unable to keep the ship on the correct heading. Nor could they cope with the rough weather which is frequently encountered in the Black Sea. They were prone to rapid rolling and pitching in anything more than a flat calm, and could not aim or load their guns under such circumstances. The design of these ships was very controversial while they were being built in the 1870s, with many articles being published in the newspapers of the day by supporters and detractors, and later picked up by historians. One such account, published in 1875, claimed that Novgorod made an uncontrollable turn while on the Dniepr, while Reed, describing a time when the ship's engines on one side were reversed during a cruise in Sevastopol Bay, wrote: "The circular form is so extremely favourable to this kind of handiness that the Novgorod can easily be revolved on her centre at a speed which quickly makes one giddy. She can, nevertheless, be promptly brought to rest, and, if, needed have her rotary motion reversed." It would seem probable that the two reports quoted above were combined into the story as given by Fred T. Jane: "On a trial cruise, they (Novgorod and Vitse-admiral Popov) went up the Dniepr very nicely for some distance, till they turned to retire. Then the current caught them, and they were carried out to sea, whirled helplessly round and round, every soul on board helplessly incapacitated by vertigo." The other criticisms made by Preston have been discussed earlier and the opinion of naval historian Stephen McLaughlin is a reasonable assessment of these ships: In the final analysis, the popovkas seem to have been relatively effective coast-defence vessels; certainly their combination of armament and armour could have only been carried by a conventional ship of much greater draught. Their faults – and they certainly had faults – were exaggerated by critics, both in Russia and abroad, and have left as a legacy stories of uncontrollable ships designed by incompetent men. A detailed review of Russian circular ironclads has been made by Roffey in 1974 with photos and information available at that time.  Notes Citations Bibliography McLaughlin, Stephen (2014).

The Bog People: Iron-Age Man Preserved is an archaeological study of the bog bodies of Northern Europe written by the Danish archaeologist P.V. Glob. First published in 1965 by Gyldendal under the Danish title of Mosefolket: Jernalderens Mennesker bevaret i 2000 År, it was translated into English by the English archaeologist Rupert Bruce-Mitford and published by Faber and Faber in 1969. In 1966 it was translated into German by Thyra Dohrenburg and published by Winkler Verlag Munich under the title Die Schläfer im Moor (English: The Sleepers in the Bog). The Bog People is divided into six chapters. The first is devoted to Tollund Man, and the second to Grauballe Man, two of the best known Iron Age bog bodies to have been discovered in Jutland, Denmark. The third and fourth chapters are devoted to the wider context of bog bodies first in Denmark and then in other parts of Europe. The final two chapters are devoted to a wider exposition of life and death in Iron Age Denmark. Glob's book received positive reviews from both Barry Cunliffe in Nature and Ralph M. Rowlett in American Anthropologist. They praised Glob's arguments as well as his writing style and use of illustrations, alongside Bruce-Mitford's translation. In subsequent decades, it has received both praise and criticism from specialists in the field, who have lauded the publicity which it brought to the subject, but rejected many of Glob's conclusions as being based on insufficient evidence.  Synopsis Chapter one, "The Tollund Man", is devoted to the bog body of the same name that was discovered in 1950 in Tollund Fell, Bjaeldskov Dal in Jutland, Denmark. Glob discusses the excavation of the corpse, and his own personal involvement with the operation. Outlining the find's removal to the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, he then outlines the manner in which the head was conserved for public display at the Silkeborg Museum. Alongside this he also discusses the archaeological context of Tollund Man, examining the manner in which he was executed, his clothing, and the contents of his last meal. The second chapter, entitled "The Grauballe Man", deals with the eponymous bog body found in 1952 at Nebelgård Fen, located  11 miles (18 km) east of Tolland. Like with the previous chapter, Glob discusses his own personal investigation into the body, outlining its discovery and conservation, as well as the context of his death and burial.  In the third chapter, "Bog People in Denmark", Glob notes that there have been over 150 bog bodies found in Denmark, and proceeds to provide a number of examples including Haraldskær Woman and the Borremose bodies, in doing so highlighting the similarities that exist between them. Noting that many of these were discovered in the 19th and early 20th centuries, he explains that little can be known about most of them because methods of archaeological investigation and conservation were unavailable at the time. Chapter four, "Bog People in Other Countries", explores similar bog bodies which have been discovered in neighbouring Germany and the Netherlands, such as Windeby I, making reference to the cataloging project undertaken by the German archaeologist Alfred Dieck. "How They Lived" is the title of the fifth chapter, and explores the wider context of life in Iron Age Denmark, dealing with such issues as class divisions, houses and garments. The final chapter, "When Death Came", looks at the place of death in Iron Age Denmark, outlining ordinary funerary remains, which include both cremation and inhumation. Contrasting these methods of dealing with the dead to the corpses left in the bogs, he argues that the latter must represent evidence for a widespread tradition of human sacrifice devoted to a fertility goddess, citing the writings of Tacitus as evidence.  Reception Academic reviews The Nature journal published a review provided by the English archaeologist Barry Cunliffe of the University of Southampton. He expresses only one disappointment with Glob's work, that there is what he sees as a lack of information on the daily life and social structure of Iron Age Denmark. He nevertheless feels compensated by the final chapter, which he describes as representing Glob "at his best, building-up, in detective-style fashion", a picture of ritual behavior in the Iron Age. Praising the use of photographs as "brilliant", he refers to the "attractive" translation of Bruce-Mitford, and considers the overall effect to be "stimulating and provocative". Summarizing The Bog People, he labels it a "splendid book, full of detail and fascination" for both specialists and a wider readership interested in archaeology. Ralph M. Rowlett of the University of Missouri wrote a review of The Bog People for the journal American Anthropologist. He began his review by describing his background interest in bog bodies, and highlighting that he had married one of Glob's graduate students. He proceeds to note that there is much in the book that would be of interest to anthropologists, and he hoped that they would not be put off by its use of "gossip and anecdote" and its "intensely personal and culturally ultra-Danish tone", which he attributes to Glob's attempts to reach a wider, non-academic audience. Praising Glob's use of ethnohistory and epic literature to illuminate the Early Iron Age, he claims that The Bog People represents "one of the best modern ethnographic descriptions of the North Germani of that era" and that it furthermore provides evidence in support of Tacitus' claims. Rowlett goes on to praise Bruce-Mitford's translation, but believes that he has a "slight tendency to over-translate" with place names, and also disagrees with his decision to convert centimeters into inches. Ending his review, Rowlett notes that along with Alfred Deick's catalog of bog bodies, The Bog People represented "a starter for a by no means exhausted field."  Wider reception In an academic paper discussing the bog bodies which was published in 1995, C.S. Briggs criticised Glob for jumping to conclusions that were not supported by the evidence, exclaiming "Can Glob's book today actually pass muster as responsible popular scholarship?". In particular, they highlighted that he ascribed many bodies to the Iron Age when they had not been securely carbon dated and that he overconfidently proclaimed the Drumkeeragh Lady from Medieval Ireland to be a Danish Viking despite a lack of supporting evidence.  In his 1996 book on bog bodies, Wijnand Van der Sanden paid homage to Glob's The Bog Bodies, describing it as a "highly accessible work" which had done more than any other to bring publicity to the bog cadavers. Exclaiming that he was filled with admiration for the work, he noted that he wished that he himself had written it 30 years before. In their 2007 edited volume on the reinvestigation of Grauballe Man, Pauline Asingh and Niels Lynnerup stated that Glob's book had represented a "major contribution" to the study of bog bodies which "awoke many people's interest in prehistory". Nobel Prize-winning Irish poet Seamus Heaney wrote a series of poems inspired by the book, finding contemporary political relevance in the relics of the ritualistic killings. Heaney's poem The Tollund Man, published in his Wintering Out collection, compares the ritual sacrifice to those who died in the sectarian violence of "the Troubles." In her 2009 study of the cultural and artistic reception of the bog bodies, Karin Sanders noted that she had first become interested in archaeology through reading a copy of Mosefolket in her primary school's library, near to Copenhagen. Proceeding to describe the book as "a classic", she noted that even in the 21st century, it continued to offer the "source book" for artistic expressions of bog bodies. Proceeding to explore the influence of Glob's tome, she noted that many artists and writers had used it as a basis for learning more about the bog bodies, to whom their works were dedicated, and that Glob himself had successfully blended an engaging narrative with archaeological information, and that he was "profoundly influenced by the potentiality of interaction between fact and fiction."

Terministic screen is a term in the theory and criticism of rhetoric. It involves the acknowledgment of a language system that determines an individual's perception and symbolic action in the world.  Overview Kenneth Burke develops the terministic screen in his book of essays called Language as Symbolic Action in 1966. He defines the concept as "a screen composed of terms through which humans perceive the world, and that direct attention away from some interpretations and toward others". Burke offers the metaphor to explain why people interpret messages differently, based on the construction of symbols, meanings, and, therefore, reality. Words convey a particular meaning, conjuring images and ideas that induce support toward beliefs or opinions. Receivers interpret the intended message through a metaphorical screen of their own vocabulary and perspective to the world. Certain terms may grab attention and lead to a particular conclusion. "Language reflects, selects, and deflects as a way of shaping the symbol systems that allow us to cope with the world".  Scientistic versus dramatistic Burke describes two different types of terministic screens: scientistic and dramatistic. Scientistic begins with a definition of a term; it describes the term as what it is or what it is not, putting the term in black and white. When defining, the essential function is either attitudinal or hortatory. In other words, the focus is on expressions or commands. When terms are treated as hortatory, they are developed. Burke comments on why he uses developed rather than another word. "I say 'developed'; I do not say 'originating'. The ultimate origins of language seem to me as mysterious as the origins of the universe itself. One must view it, I feel, simply as the 'given' ". The dramatistic approach concerns action: thou shalt or thou shalt not. This screen directs the audience toward action based on interpretation of a term. Via terministic screens, the audience will be able to associate with the term or dissociate from it.  Social constructionism "Social constructionism is a metaphor that attempts to capture the way Burke viewed the nature of the world and the function of language therein." Symbols, terms, and language build our view of life. Social constructionism allows us to look at Burke's theory in terms we recognize and are comfortable with.  Examples When a person says gender, most people, based on their individual beliefs, normally think of male or female. However, some could think of intersex individuals. If someone says they think of male, female, and intersex, more would be reflected about the person based on their terminology. Still others would recognize gender as different from biological sex, and say they think of man, woman, and other genders. Another example occurs within the abortion controversy. A pro-choice advocate would most likely use the word "fetus" but opponents of legal abortion would use the word "baby", because the term stirs more realistic and relatable images and has a bearing on the legal status. Using the word "baby" versus "fetus" defines reality differently (scientistic) and guides people to act in a certain way (dramatistic) solely based on term selection that may be unconscious.  Importance Words are absolute for thought and action. In other words, language is needed to perform thought and action. One can not think without language, and therefore can not act without language and thought. In his "Definition of Man" Burke refers to man as the "symbol using animal" because of man's capacity  to use a complex web of symbol systems (language) for meaning making. According to Burke, individuals create terministic screens consciously and unconsciously, as they perceive the world and share perspectives.  Burke contends these screens set up a network of beliefs through which all ideas will be interpreted. Communication scholar Paul Stob contends that the language we use is thus not just a direct reflection of our intelligence, but also of perception and culture.  David Blakesley posits that the terministic screen enables the further understanding of rhetorical perspectives. In each of these ways, the terministic screen allows for concepts to be interpreted in different ways by different people and contribute to the complexity of meaning.

The Chinese Culture University (CCU; Chinese: 中國文化大學) is a private Taiwanese university located in Yangmingshan in Shilin District, Taipei, Taiwan. Established in 1962, CCU is one of the largest universities in Taiwan with an enrollment of about 32,000 students. Satellite campuses are located in the Jianguo, Ximending, and Zhongxiao East Road areas of Taipei City. CCU has a vast collaboration and network with top universities around the world.  History The school was founded as Far East University in 1962 by Chang Chi-yun, and it was renamed College of Chinese Culture by President Chiang Kai-shek in 1963. It became Chinese Culture University in 1980. The main campus is located on Yang Ming Mountain, overlooks the Tienmu District, and is about a 45-minute drive from Taipei Main Station. The area is known for its extensive hiking trails and hot springs. The university is located just off of the main road that winds up the mountain where a 24-hour Wellcome Supermarket, 7-11, Starbucks, Mos Burger, and McDonald's can be found. Many of the students rent apartments in this small village area and the city buses have stops along the main road. Chinese Culture University has been reorganized many times.  The Ministry of Education granted the University permission to establish studies in philosophy, Chinese, Eastern languages, English, French, German, history, geography, news, art, music, drama, physical education, domestic science, and architecture.  Academics CCU has 12 colleges: Agriculture, Arts, Business Administration, Education, Engineering, Environmental Design, Foreign Languages, Journalism and Mass Communications, Law, Liberal Arts, Science, and Social Sciences. CCU first appeared and ranked 401-450 in the QS 2022 Asian Universities Ranking. In 2023, CCU was ranked 16th best Taiwanese university focusing on humanities and social sciences by Global Views Monthly.  Transportation The relatively inconvenient and isolated location of CCU's main campus has presented students and staff with transportation problems. While the university operates a number of school buses to transport faculty, staff and students up and down the mountain every day, many students chose to ride scooters up to the main campus. This has resulted in a high number of student injuries and fatalities each semester. Public buses, the R5 and 260, also operate between the main campus and downtown Taipei. These buses also make stops at Jiantan and Shilin MRT train stations. Taxi service can be found on the main campus with taxis waiting for students and teachers in front of the university sports centre during the daytime hours.  Facilities CCU has four campuses in Taipei City. The main campus is located on Yang Ming Mountain and three other smaller campuses are located in Jianguo, Ximending, and Zhongxiao East Road in downtown Taipei. The Jianguo campus is the location of the Mandarin Training Centre, while the Zhongxiao East Road campus is the location of the International Language Institute. The Ximending campus offers a variety of both credit and non-credit courses in addition to being an extension campus for the College of Law.  The Hwa Kang Museum Established in 1971, the university museum, also called the Hwa Kang Museum, is the first comprehensive museum of its kind in Taiwan. Its permanent collection consists of Chinese ceramics from the many centuries, modern Chinese paintings and calligraphic works, Chinese folk arts and woodblock prints. Some highlights of the collection include pieces by Wang Yangming, Wu Changshuo, Woo Tsin-hang, Yu Youren, Puru, Chang Dai-chien, and Li Meishu.  Athletics CCU offers martial arts programs on the Yang Ming Shan campus. The CCU Judo team is internationally competitive and a number of members have won their division in both national and international tournaments. The CCU Martial Arts Department also offers courses in Japanese ju jitsu, aikido and kung fu. The CCU baseball program was established in 1964, in the second year of the school's history.

Papilio appalachiensis, the Appalachian tiger swallowtail, is a species of swallowtail butterfly found in eastern North America, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains. It is a hybrid of another two Papilio species, Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus, with which it shares many characteristics. The butterflies are normally yellow and contain black patterns in their wings. Their wingspans range from 86 to 115 mm. The caterpillars range in color from green and yellow to orange and are ornamented with black specks that give them the appearance of a bird dropping, which is useful for camouflage, or a large eye, a form of mimicry that is also efficient for protection. This species is univoltine. Females lay their eggs in May.  Taxonomy Papilio appalachiensis is a member of the genus Papilio in the order Lepidoptera. It is closely related to Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus.  Distribution The butterfly is found in the eastern United States, specifically in the Appalachian Mountains, ranging from Pennsylvania to Georgia.  It is notably larger than both the eastern tiger swallowtail and the Canadian tiger swallowtail.  Evolution P. appalachiensis is thought to have evolved as a hybrid species of two other Papilio butterflies: P. canadensis and P. glaucus. Originally, researchers believed that P. canadensis and P. glaucus were distributed in distinct regions separated by a hybrid zone stretching east from Minnesota to southern New England and south along the Appalachian Mountains.  In 2005, researchers suggested these two species interacted  at some point and produced the new hybrid P. appalachiensis in the hybrid zone. Although each species of tiger swallowtail butterflies is usually confined to a specific "thermal landscape", based on specific X-linked markers and various behavioral traits, laboratory and observational studies have shown the hybrid Appalachian tiger swallowtail butterflies have emerged. Data collected about oviposition preferences and larval mortality rates further suggest hybridization between P. canadensis and P. glaucus. Due to shifting thermal landscapes, the ranges of both P. glaucus and P. canadensis have moved dramatically enough to overlay, leading to crossbreeding that has resulted in P. appalachiensis. Although hybrid speciation is often difficult to achieve, given the difficulty of finding a habitat separate from either parental species (competitive exclusion) and remaining genetically distinct from the parental species (reproductive isolation), P. appalachiensis accomplishes this by living in a separate habitat: a higher elevation in the Appalachian Mountains.  Appearance The Appalachian tiger swallowtail has similarities to both parent species; it resembles P. canadensis as it is adapted to a cooler temperature and has only one brood per year (univoltine), but also resembles P. glaucus as it displays sex-limited polymorphism with the dark female morph displaying mimicry. However, research has shown that P. appalachiensis may be more closely related genetically to P. canadensis than to P. glaucus. Females of P. appalachiensis are generally larger than those of P. glaucus. Their wings are slightly angular and have vertical black stripes that are narrower than those on P. glaucus. The hindwing scallops are also less curved and more angular than those of P. glaucus. Additionally, the spots on their hindwings are also less crescent shaped and rectangular compared to those of P. glaucus. Males' hindwings tend to be more triangular. The female has two forms: yellow and black. Both the yellow and black forms have a slight blue tint on the topside of the hindwings that is significantly reduced from the stronger blue tint on those of the tiger swallowtails. On the topside of the hindwing, there is a large orange spot. Their wingspan is 86–115 mm (3.4–4.5 in). Initially, no black forms of P. appalachiensis were thought to exist, but researchers found two black females on the summit of Spruce Knob in West Virginia.  Caterpillar The caterpillars of Papilio species are usually smooth and vary in color from green to yellow orange. In addition, they have black markings to mimic the appearance of bird droppings or the head of another bug with large "eyes". The eyespot consists of areas of yellow ringed with black with a smaller, light purple spot (also ringed in black) inside. Additionally, a small black spot on top of the "eye" gives it the appearance of a true eye. This form of mimicry provides a natural defense mechanism against potential predators. In addition to their appearance, every caterpillar of the swallowtail family has an osmeterium, a special scent gland behind the head that, when disturbed, is everted from its pouch and releases a foul odor. The gland is orange red, fleshy, forked and generally intimidating to potential predators. The mimicry induced by the eyespots and forked gland give the caterpillar the appearance of a snake, adding to its defense mechanisms against potential predators. The caterpillar lives in a nest that it creates in the trees by folding a leaf over itself and pulling together the two halves with silk. By the time it is ready to undergo metamorphosis, the caterpillar can grow to be up to 5 cm (2 in) long. About a month is needed for the egg to develop into an adult. Fully-grown caterpillars tend to be green. After hatching, the caterpillar usually eats the egg shell. The caterpillars have been known to eat from the black cherry.  Ecology Life cycle The Appalachian tiger swallowtail is univoltine. Female butterflies usually lay their singular brood from May to June. During the mating season, the males fly through the treetops, scouting for females. Females, though, tend to be difficult to find because they prefer to hide in the forest canopy. After mating, females lay their eggs singularly on host plant leaves. The caterpillars, after hatching, then eat the host plants' leaves and undergo chrysalis throughout the winter. Pupation occurs around late June to July and pupae diapause until spring. Adults hatch in May.  Habitat Appalachian tiger swallowtail butterflies tend to congregate in the woodlands and woodland openings. They prefer to remain in mid-level to high elevations in the southern Appalachian Mountains, and the species' range stretches from Pennsylvania to Georgia and Alabama. This species is extremely prevalent at higher elevations, but can also be found at lower elevations or valleys within mountainous terrain. The adult butterflies tend to remain in the canopy of the Appalachian hardwood forest and mainly only leave when visiting flowers. Their habitats often parallel those of P. glaucus.  Nectar plants Adults drink nectar from many plants, including the mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), the pink azalea (Rhododendron nudiflorum), the blackberry (Rubus), the cockspur thorn (Crataegus crus-galli), the multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora), and the bush honeysuckle (Diervilla). Near the summit, they also tend to drink from the autumn olive (Elaeagnus commutata), but at lower elevation, they drink from the daisy fleabane (Erigeron ramosus).  Host plants The larvae eat the leaves of a wide variety of trees, including cottonwood, tulip tree, lemon and cherry.  Flight patterns The Appalachian tiger swallowtail shares a delayed flight pattern and many other hybrid-like traits with P. glaucus and P. canadensis despite its genetic isolation. Its flight period is in May. Some individuals take flight during late June, while others fly from May to early June. Populations of this species make annual migrations of over 200 km (120 mi). Papilio appalachiensis usually has a singular flight period from spring to early summer and emerges later than P. glaucus. The Appalachian tiger swallowtail tends to fly directly up the western side of Spruce Knob towards the summit against strong westerly winds. The summit contains substantial vegetation within protected nooks where the adult butterflies rest and obtain nectar from various plants.   == References ==

USS Illinois (SSN-786) is a Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarine in the United States Navy. Named for the State of Illinois, she is the third vessel with the name, the previous two being battleships BB-7 and BB-65, which was never completed. She was built by the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics, the third of their Block III variants which feature a revised bow and technology from the converted sub-class of Ohio guided missile submarines (SSGN). The contract for the build was awarded on 22 December 2008 to Huntington Ingalls Industries in partnership with Electric Boat, and construction commenced with the keel laying ceremony on 2 June 2014, at their yard in Groton, Connecticut. First Lady Michelle Obama served as the ship's sponsor, and christened the boat on 10 October 2015. Illinois was launched on 8 August 2015 and completed sea trials on 2 August 2016. She was delivered to the Navy on 27 August 2016 and commissioned in a ceremony at Naval Submarine Base New London on 29 October 2016. Then-First Lady Michelle Obama, as the sponsor, attended the ceremony and is considered to be an honorary member of the crew due to her support of military families and her involvement with the Illinois crew and their families.  History Illinois completed a change of home port from Naval Submarine Base New London to Naval Base Pearl Harbor on 22 November 2017, where she is assigned to Submarine Squadron One.  Ship's crest The official ship's crest was designed by Christopher Durdle of Roseville, IL and accepted by the Navy at an unveiling ceremony at the Union League Club of Chicago on 2 April 2015.  First Lady Michelle Obama congratulated the contest finalists and crew via video at the ceremony.

Colorpuncture, cromopuncture, or color light acupuncture, is a pseudoscientific alternative medicine practice based on "mystical or supernatural" beliefs which asserts that colored lights can be used to stimulate acupuncture points to promote healing and better health. It is a form of chromotherapy or color therapy. There is no known anatomical or histological basis for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians, and there is no scientific support for the efficacy of colorpuncture.  Background Colorpuncture was developed in the 1980s by German naturopath and acupuncturist Peter Mandel, who named it esogetic colorpuncture. "Esogetic" is a term coined by Mandel to refer to the "merger of esoteric wisdom of life with the energetic principles of life's processes". Mandel cited Fritz-Albert Popp, who claimed that the body's cells communicate with each other through a steady stream of photons. This is not a scientifically recognized method of cell communication. Using Kirlian photography, Mandel concluded that the acupuncture meridians absorb and disseminate colored light within the body. Colorpuncture is based on the idea that illness and pain occur when an individual has strayed off his or her "life path". For example, a treatment might be intended to release an emotional blockage to heal a nervous system condition, allowing patients to devote themselves to their individual spiritual purpose. Three of the six factors (called molecules) represent the subtle energies: the chakras, the formative field, and the converter model.  The other three factors describe the physical reality: the body systems, the coordination system, and the transmitter relays.  Treatment Colorpuncture employs seven basic colors.  In general, the warm colors - red, orange, and yellow - are believed to add energy, while the cool colors - green, blue, and violet - decrease energy.  Mandel also claims that warm and cool colors, when used together, balance yin and yang energy flows. A small handheld instrument resembling a torch (flashlight) with a colored quartz rod is used. The tip is placed directly onto acupoints or held a short distance above. Unlike acupuncture, the skin is not broken. Colorpuncture sessions last 10 to 90 minutes.  Colorpuncturists claim to diagnose through the use of Kirlian photography.  Reception Jack Raso writing in the Skeptical Inquirer included colorpuncture in a list of "mystical or supernaturalistic" therapies. Harriet Hall points out there is no supporting research for colorpuncture and explains how color can be used for diagnosis rather than treatment. A review of research studies conducted in Europe to evaluate the efficacy of colorpuncture concluded that the approach lacked a research base to be considered anything but a pilot or preliminary research stage. Quackwatch lists it as a questionable treatment, and research on colorpuncture has failed to demonstrate a consistent effect. The Spanish Government's health reference has ruled it a "pseudotherapy."  See also Chromotherapy Pseudoscience List of topics characterized as pseudoscience   == References ==

First Demo 12/29/80 is an EP by American hardcore punk band State of Alert. It contains eight tracks recorded on December 29, 1980, by engineer Don Zientara at the group's first studio session with Skip Groff at Inner Ear Studios in Arlington, Virginia. The EP was released as a seven-inch, 45-rpm vinyl record in March 2014 by Dischord Records. S.O.A. was formed in October 1980 by 19-year-old Henry Garfield, now known as Henry Rollins, with guitarist Michael Hampton, bassist Wendel Blow, and drummer Simon Jacobsen. The group performed a total of nine shows before disbanding in July 1981, and, prior to the release of First Demo, had issued less than 30 minutes of music. The track titled "Gonna Have to Fight" was included on the band's 1981 debut release, No Policy, while "Disease" and "Stepping Stone Party" were originally issued on the 1982 Dischord sampler Flex Your Head. The remaining tracks are previously unreleased alternate versions of songs that also appeared on No Policy.  Reception In a review for AllMusic, Mark Deming wrote: "Most of First Demo sounds like standard-issue hardcore of the era... energetic but not especially remarkable... D.C. hardcore completists and folks interested in Henry Rollins' first baby steps in punk rock will want to have this historical document, but while it packs some kicks, don't expect to be enlightened." James Bennett of SLUG Magazine stated: "This is a forceful, quick single that allows the listener to better understand why 1980s D.C. was so important to the development of American Hardcore." The Washington City Paper's Brent Burton noted that the band is "surprisingly confident," and commented: "the S.O.A demo is a valuable reminder of a time when D.C. punks were exploring the outer limits of what it meant to be hardcore." Writing for Verbicide, Chris Martin called the album a "whirlwind of unbridled energy," and remarked: "While SOA was far from groundbreaking, their music is a must listen for punk lovers everywhere. Garfield and crew packed more punch into their 40-second songs than many musicians did in a lifetime. First Demo is a nice addition to their minimal collection." In an article for The Quietus, Andrew Holter described "Gonna Have to Fight" as "a window into the world of a young man who has fully accepted the violence that his adopted subculture invites from off-duty Marines, Southern Maryland rednecks, and the like." He wrote: "It's self-defence he's urging, yes, but you can hear in the voice that this kid has internalised the words of Mick Jones: 'And if I get aggression, I give it two times back'."

Agni-VI(Sanskrit: अग्नि; IAST: Agni; lit. Fire) is an MIRV-capable intercontinental ballistic missile under development by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for the Strategic Forces Command (SFC) of the Indian Armed Forces.  Description Agni-VI will be a four-stage intercontinental ballistic missile, which is in the hardware development phase, after its design phase was completed. Agni-VI is expected to have Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle as well as Maneuverable reentry vehicle (MaRV). And these maneuverable warheads will give Agni VI an extended range exact figure of which is currently classified. It will be taller than its predecessor Agni V, and was expected to be flight tested by 2017. The government of India is yet to approve the project, although DRDO has completed all calculations and started the engineering work.  It is reported to be the latest and most advanced version among the Agni missiles. According to sources, Agni-VI missile is likely to carry up to 10 MIRV warheads and will have a strike range of 12,000 km, though DRDO has refused to confirm the missile's range. A senior DRDO scientist was quoted as saying that the new generation Agni-VI missile will be sleeker, easily transportable and would be readily deployed. It will have the capability to be launched from submarine and from land-based launchers.  History A report from Centre for Land Warfare Studies published in 2011 suggested that New Delhi had not considered the need for an ICBM, despite India not being bound by any treaty commitments to refrain from developing ICBM capability. It also said that DRDO is constrained by the requirement to obtain government's permission before starting the development of an ICBM. In June 2011, for the first time then IAF Chief Marshal Pradeep Vasant Naik vehemently argued in favour of broadening India's nuclear strike capabilities beyond the immediate neighbourhood. Naik, who was also the head of the Chiefs of Staff committee, stated, "India should pursue an ICBM programme to acquire ranges of 10,000 km or more. Breaking out of the regional context is important as the country's sphere of influence grows. We have no territorial designs on any country, but India needs the capability to match its sphere of influence." In October 2011, The Pioneer published a report questioning DRDO's ability to independently develop seeker technology (guidance technology) suitable for ICBMs, that could enable the missile to traverse long distances in excess of 10,000 km. The same report also asserted Russia's willingness to help India with seeker technology. The authenticity of the pioneer report is disputed by at least one foreign newspaper, with the counter-claim that the involvement of Russia is probably inflated out of proportion, because if the report about Russian involvement is true, Russia may be suspected of violating the Missile Technology Control Regime. In response to the scepticism, a top DRDO scientist asserted that India has all the equipment and technology needed to develop ICBMs, "but where the warhead should go or what the range should be will have to be a political call." On 20 June 2011, Indian Defence News published an article titled India Serious About 10,000 km ICBM which stated that India is seriously contemplating to enhance the reach of its strategic missiles and that the Ministry of Defense is considering a DRDO proposal to develop intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of hitting targets 10,000 km away. Building an ICBM has international ramifications and the ultimate decision to go ahead with the proposal would be taken by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS). In April 2012, after the successful launch of Agni V, Saraswat revealed that India had no plans to cap the Agni program and that there will be more missiles in the future.  Recent developments In May 2018, reports confirmed the development of another ICBM in the Agni series, a three-stage Agni VI missile. It was proposed that the missile will be developed in 2024 or so and will have an even longer range, up to 8,000 km to 12,000 km. The Agni VI will be sleeker than the Agni-V and capable of carrying at least 10 nuclear warheads, capable of targeting multiple targets at the same time. In January 2013, DRDO chief V K Saraswat said that after the development of Agni V, DRDO will develop Agni VI which will have Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicle (MIRV) capability. He said that the missile design has been completed and DRDO is in the hardware realisation phase. In September 2013, DRDO chief said that India can achieve a missile with a range of 10,000 km within two and a half years, adding that increasing the range of a missile is the least challenging task. As per people related to Agni VI development, government officials carefully watched 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and how ICBM played its role in geopolitics. By 2025, unofficially India might go ahead with technology demonstrator to validate computer simulations to cover furthest corner of China from a safer survival distance. The Agni VI programme is already on track and DRDO is simultaneously working on SLBM variant. The DRDO scientist from Pune, Pradeep Kurulkar, who was honey trapped by a Pakistani agent, for the first time publicly revealed the details concerning Agni-VI launcher's development in 2023.

Necessary Angels is the third album by the American singer-songwriter Sara Hickman, released in 1994 (see 1994 in music). After Hickman was dropped by her label, Elektra Records, her fans contributed to allow her to buy back the unreleased tapes that made up the album.  Critical reception AllMusic called the album Hickman's "boldest, most mature, and most musically sophisticated offering to date." New York called it an "enormously rich album." Billboard wrote that Hickman "eschews some of her earlier wordplay for lyrics that are cleaner and sharper ... Lovely."

Macaulay's method (the double integration method) is a technique used in structural analysis to determine the deflection of Euler-Bernoulli beams.  Use of Macaulay's technique is very convenient for cases of discontinuous and/or discrete loading.  Typically partial uniformly distributed loads (u.d.l.) and uniformly varying loads (u.v.l.) over the span and a number of concentrated loads are conveniently handled using this technique. The first English language description of the method was by Macaulay.  The actual approach appears to have been developed by Clebsch in 1862.  Macaulay's method has been generalized for Euler-Bernoulli beams with axial compression, to Timoshenko beams, to elastic foundations, and to problems in which the bending and shear stiffness changes discontinuously in a beam.  Method The starting point is the relation from Euler-Bernoulli beam theory                         ±         E         I                                                                                    d                                        2                                                     w                                               d                                    x                                        2                                                                                             =         M                 {\displaystyle \pm EI{\dfrac {d^{2}w}{dx^{2}}}=M}     Where                         w                 {\displaystyle w}     is the deflection and                         M                 {\displaystyle M}     is the bending moment. This equation is simpler than the fourth-order beam equation and can be integrated twice to find                         w                 {\displaystyle w}     if the value of                         M                 {\displaystyle M}     as a function of                         x                 {\displaystyle x}     is known.  For general loadings,                         M                 {\displaystyle M}     can be expressed in the form                         M         =                    M                        1

Using these integration rules makes the calculation of the deflection of Euler-Bernoulli beams simple in situations where there are multiple point loads and point moments.  The Macaulay method predates more sophisticated concepts such as Dirac delta functions and step functions but achieves the same outcomes for beam problems.  Example: Simply supported beam with point load An illustration of the Macaulay method considers a simply supported beam with a single eccentric concentrated load as shown in the adjacent figure.  The first step is to find                         M                 {\displaystyle M}    . The reactions at the supports A and C are determined from the balance of forces and moments as                                    R                        A                             +

equations (iii) & (vii) and (iv) & (viii) we notice that due to continuity at point B,                                    C                        1                             =                    D

The above observation implies that for the two regions considered, though the equation for bending moment and hence for the curvature are different, the constants of integration got during successive integration of the equation for curvature for the two regions are the same. The above argument holds true for any number/type of discontinuities in the equations for curvature, provided that in each case the equation retains the term for the subsequent region in the form                         ⟨         x         −         a                    ⟩                        n                             ,         ⟨         x         −         b                    ⟩                        n                             ,         ⟨         x         −         c                    ⟩                        n                                     {\displaystyle \langle x-a\rangle ^{n},\langle x-b\rangle ^{n},\langle x-c\rangle ^{n}}     etc. It should be remembered that for any x, giving the quantities within the brackets, as in the above case, -ve should be neglected, and the calculations should be made considering only the quantities which give +ve sign for the terms within the brackets.

Tamala Park is an unpopulated locality in Perth, Western Australia. It sits on the border between the City of Wanneroo and the City of Joondalup local authorities, and separates the Clarkson-Butler region from the suburbs of Joondalup.  History The Mooro group of Noongar were familiar with the area, and several of their traditional stories and legends refer to local Tamala Park land features, such as Waukolup Hill, although evidence suggests that they lived much further east, closer to modern-day Wanneroo Road. The suburb was formally established by excision of parts of Mindarie, Clarkson and Burns Beach on 9 September 1988.  Present use At present, Tamala Park is mostly unoccupied bushland, primarily used as a landfill and recycling centre. Two arterial roads, Marmion Avenue and Connolly Drive, run through it and link the suburbs on each side. It is a large locality, extending from the Joondalup railway line in the east, to the coast of the Indian Ocean, where it leads onto Burns Beach to the south and Claytons Beach in Mindarie to the north. Tamala Park is in the process of being developed. The Tamala Park Regional Council (TPRC) was established to develop 165 hectares (410 acres) of land in the Tamala Park locality. The Council comprises 12 councillors representing the 7 owner councils that make up the TPRC as follows:  Town of Cambridge City of Joondalup City of Perth City of Stirling City of Wanneroo Town of Victoria Park City of Vincent Tamala Park is the 10th regional and 154th local government council to be established by proclamation in the Government Gazette in February 2006.

Jacob Martijn Roosenburg (9 July 1916 – 15 July 2004), better known as Teun Roosenburg, was a Dutch sculptor. The son of the architect Dirk Roosenburg, he attended the Royal Academy of Art in the Hague and the Académie Ranson in Paris. He worked with several materials, depicting various subjects in a figurative style. He and his wife Jopie occupied the Oost Castle from 1941, from which they led an art colony.  Early life Roosenburg was born in the Hague on 9 July 1916. The son of the architect Dirk Roosenburg, he initially studied architecture and furniture-making. One day, a teacher discovered a caricature he had drawn. Initially fearing that he would be punished, Roosenburg was instead brought to a drawing club. In 1936, he enrolled at the Royal Academy of Art in the Hague, where he apprenticed under Albert Termote. By 1939 he was living in the Jordaan neighbourhood of Amsterdam, often working with glass or terracotta to create figurative works; these included several ornaments for his father's buildings.  He later attended the Académie Ranson in Paris, studying under Charles Malfray and Aristide Maillol. Following the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in 1940, Roosenburg sought a means of practising his art without registering with the newly established Nederlandsche Kultuurkamer (Chamber of Dutch Culture). With his peers Hanni Rädecker and Piet Damsté, he thus travelled in 1942 to Eijsden in South Limburg.  After two weeks wandering the countryside seeking lodgings, he was able to rent the Oost Castle for fifty guilders per month. An art colony developed at the castle, under the leadership of Roosenburg and his girlfriend Jopie Goudriaan, whom he married in 1943. Seeking to protect the community, which was transporting money for the Resistance and using the castle's proximity to Belgium to facilitate the emigration of Jewish refugees, Roosenburg urged residents of the castle to dress as crazily as possible. As narrated by Nicolaas Wijnberg, a resident during the period, members of the colony "put on strange hats and caps, painted our shoes, and when we went outside we deliberately stared a lot and dreamily at the landscape and the cloudy sky". Food for the community, as well as those it assisted, was obtained in exchange for art. After the liberation of Eijsden, the colony hosted some two hundred American soldiers, who put on a pancake breakfast.  Later career The Roosenburgs bought Oost Castle in 1957. and Teun sought to protect the landscapes that his wife often painted. He opposed, for instance, the construction of a refinery in Ternaaien. Over the ensuing decades, he and Jopie often hosted parties for their fellow artists, writers, and musicians, with guests including the painter Hermanus Berserik, the journalist Anton Koolhaas (Teun's brother-in-law), and the writer Cola Debrot. At the same time, he continued to work.  In March 1957, Roosenburg contributed several sculptures to an exhibition of Limburger artists in Heerlen. A reviewer for De Maasbode noted that Roosenburg excelled in garden sculpture, highlighting his standing and reclining nudes; also mentioned were the "humourous" Spaanse Ruiters ("Spanish Riders") and the metaphoric war memorial De Stier ("The Bull"). That year, Roosenburg also completed a relief for the new H. J. Lovink Pumping Station. Titled Land en Water ("Land and Water"), it depicts a landward farmer and seaward fisherman shaking hands over a dyke. In its description of the rijksmonument, the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science describes this tableau as highlighting the station's significance in creating new agricultural land from the seabed. After the Doctor J.H. Hansen Hospital began construction in Emmeloord in 1962, Roosenburg was commissioned to create a sculpture for its main entrance. He thus completed Thuiskomst ("Homecoming"), which depicts a male patient, supported by a doctor, being discharged to his wife and dog. Roosenburg held several joint exhibitions with Jopie. One, at the Heerlen City Hall in April 1960, included more than sixty sculptures and paintings by the couple, as well as some ceramics. By 1982, he had held expositions in Paris, Aachen, Amsterdam, Maastricht, and Heerlen.  In his sculpture, Roosenburg employed a figurative approach that Bob Fromme of Het Parool described as "old-fashioned in the best sense of the word: classic". He was critical of more abstract approaches to art, disliking the works of Alberto Giacometti. He sought to maintain balance, arguing that "realism without interpretation is death in art, but without figurativism there is little but empthy aesthetic." Roosenburg was made a knight in the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1994; by this time, he had served as the chairman of the Limburg Association of Visual Artists. He died in Eijsden on 15 July 2004 and was buried at Tongerseweg Cemetery in Maastricht. He was predeceased by Jopie, who died in 1996. They had three children: Joost, Albert, and Olivier. The latter two became artists.  Gallery Explanatory notes References   == Works cited ==

The region known as Cabeça do Cachorro (Dog‘s head) is the area comprising the northwesternmost end of the state of Amazonas, Brazil, bordering on Colombia and Venezuela. This region roughly coincides with the Brazilian municipality of São Gabriel da Cachoeira and parts of Japurá, and shares international borders with the Venezuelan state of Amazonas (to the northeast), and the Colombian departments of Guainía (to north), Vaupés (to west) and Amazonas (to southwest). The Brazilian Army maintains a border platoon next to the border tripoint, at the village of Cucuí, where there is also a Brazilian Air Force base. Cabeça do Cachorro means, literally, "Dog's Head" in Portuguese. The name was given after the shape of this region's map, that resembles the head of a dog with its mouth wide open. This picturesque geographical shape was defined by the Treaty of Bogotá, which was signed by Colombia and Brazil in 1907 and defined the borders between the two countries according to the uti possidetis criterion. These borders were later confirmed by a supplementary Colombian-Brazilian treaty in 1928. The area has several Amerindian reservations. The municipality of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, in Cabeça do Cachorro, is the first in Brazil to adopt an Amerindian language, Nheengatu, as co-official with Portuguese. The region also has one of the largest niobium reserves in the world.

A Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) is a document designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to provide information to a patient receiving a vaccine in the United States. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires that medical professionals provide a VIS to patients before receiving certain vaccinations. The VIS includes information about the vaccine's benefits and risks, a description of the vaccine, indications and contraindications, instructions for patients experiencing an adverse reaction, and additional resources.  History In the 1974 case of Reyes v. Wyeth Laboratories, the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decided that vaccine manufacturers were responsible for warning patients of the risks associated with their vaccine. This created concern among manufacturers, since they were reliant on the healthcare professionals administering their vaccines to convey these risks, and the companies could be liable for mistakes made by healthcare providers. Consequently, vaccine prices increased to cover the costs of litigation. In response, the CDC added "duty to warn" clauses in their contracts, which required either the individualized judgement of a physician or "meaningful warnings related to the risks and benefits of vaccination" for all publicly purchased vaccines. This gave way to an early version of the VIS known as the "Important Information Statement" (ISS), the first of which was developed for "Swine and Victoria Influenza" vaccine in 1976. Over the following decade, more than 50 ISSs were created for various vaccines. An increase in vaccine-related lawsuits and fear of manufacturers withdrawing vaccines from the market led to the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA). The act established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to take liability for adverse reactions off vaccine manufacturers. The act also required the development of written information about all vaccines included in the VICP, which were primarily routine childhood vaccinations. The act required that all patients, or their parents/legal representatives, be given this information before vaccination. The secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services gave the responsibility of developing these materials to the CDC. By 1991, the CDC developed four 12-page "Vaccine Information Pamphlets" (VIPs) for DTP, MMR, polio, and tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccines. These pamphlets fulfilled the requirements of the NCVIA, but were criticized for their length and the amount of time they took to develop. Concerns were raised that patients could not read the entire forms during their visit, and could be less informed due to a less thorough review of the information. A 1993 amendment to the NCVIA simplified the requirements for the document and simplified the process through which it was created. It removed the requirement for a public hearing in the development of the document and reduced the time period for public comment to 60 days. The simplified requirements led to the single sheet (two-sided) Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) that are still used. By 1997 VISs were available for all vaccines that required them under NCVIA and the CDC began creating VISs for additional vaccines. In 2008, the Pediatric Multi-Vaccine VIS was developed, which included information on the vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis(DTaP), polio, hepatitis B, pneumococcal conjugate, and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib). This allows caregivers to read one document during their visit instead of an individual document for each vaccine. In 2013, a "provider information document" was developed to include information that was relevant to medical providers but not to patients, reducing the need to frequently update VISs. By 2016, the provider information was made available through a links to the CDC website. VISs are now available on the CDC website and can be provided in hard copies or electronically. The Immunization Action Coalition (IAC), a partner organization to the CDC, also provides translations of VISs in over 40 languages.  Contents According to the 1993 amended National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), a VIS must contain at least the following four components: (1) a description of the benefits of the given vaccine, (2) a description of its risks, (3) information about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), and (4) other relevant information as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Current VISs typically include the following sections:  "Why get vaccinated?" - This section includes a description of the benefits of the vaccine and the risks of the illness that it protects from. "[Name of vaccine]" - This section is a description of the specific vaccine, including information about who it's recommended for, its administration, the number and timing of doses, and any other pertinent information. "Talk with your health care provider" - This section includes factors that may affect someone's decision to receive the given vaccine. It includes information about allergies, illnesses, or other contraindications that may increase the risks associated with the vaccine. The section recommends a discussion with the patient's health care provider over any concerns. "Risks of a vaccine reaction" - This section includes potential side effects and adverse reactions. "What if there is a serious problem?" - This section contains instructions for patients experiencing an adverse reaction. It includes instructions to contact either their health care provider or 9-1-1, depending on the level of severity, and contact information for the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). "The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program" - This section is only included in VISs for vaccines covered by the VICP, as set forth in the NCVIA. It includes the website and phone number for the VICP. "How can I learn more?" - This section includes additional resources and contact information for the CDC. The Multi-Vaccine VIS (DTaP, Hib, hepatitis B, polio, and pneumococcal conjugate) includes the same sections listed above, with sub-headings in the first four sections for each of the vaccines included, as needed.  Requirements for distribution A VIS must be given prior to vaccination in the United States when a patient is being vaccinated for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), influenza, pneumococcal conjugate, meningococcal, rotavirus, human papillomavirus (HPV), or varicella (chickenpox) according to the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA). The VIS must be given to the person receiving the vaccine or to their parent/legal representative prior to each dose of the vaccine. The "legal representative" is defined as the person who can consent to the vaccination under the laws of the state in which the vaccine is being given. The CDC has also developed VISs for vaccines not covered by the NCVIA, which are recommended for use with these vaccines, and required if the vaccines are purchased under CDC contract under the "duty to warn" clause. VISs can be provided on paper, in electronic form, or on a laminated office copy. The VIS can be given in a prior appointment, but must also be offered at the visit in which the  vaccination is occurring. The patient or parent/representative must be offered a copy of the VIS take home, since the document contains information about what to do in case of an adverse reaction. When a patient receives multiple vaccines in one visit or a combination vaccine, a VIS should be given for each vaccine or component. The Multi-Vaccine VIS can be used for children receiving DTaP, polio, Hib, hepatitis B, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. The Multi-Vaccine VIS is not designed for adults or adolescents. To document the receipt of the VIS, the healthcare provider must record the edition of the VIS and the date it was provided, in addition to the documentation required for the vaccination (date of vaccination, the vaccine manufacturer and lot number, and the office address, name, and title of the person administering the vaccine).  Special Circumstances In some circumstances, the parent or legal representative of a patient may not be present for the vaccination, such as school-based clinics or long-term care facilities. In these cases, the parent or legal representative can be given the VIS at the time they provide consent or at the time of admission to a long-term care facility. In cases like school-based clinics where a VIS might be sent home to parents, it should be sent home as close to the time of the vaccination as possible, and the parent or legal representative must acknowledge receipt of the VIS, in writing or electronically, including the edition of the VIS and the date it was given. It can be included in the consent form for the vaccination.  Accommodations The NCVIA requires that healthcare providers use the CDC-produced VIS, unaltered (although they may add contact information for the office). For patients with visual impairments or other needs, the VIS may additionally be read aloud or supplemented with visuals, videos, explanations, or other materials. For patients who are not comfortable with English, translations into over 40 languages are available from the Immunization Action Coalition (IAC).

Perry County is a county located in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Indiana. As of 2020, the population was 19,170. The county seat is Tell City. It is the hilliest county as well as one of the most forested counties in Indiana as it features more than 60,000 acres (240 km2) of Hoosier National Forest. The Ohio River Scenic Byway along Indiana State Road 66 runs along the southern border of the county while Interstate 64 traverses the northern portion of the county. Connecting the two is Indiana State Road 37. The county features three incorporated communities: Tell City (2009 population 7,473), Cannelton (2009 population 1,130) and Troy (2009 population 379). Each is located in Troy Township which is situated along the south western corner of the county. Coordinated efforts with County officials led to the acquisition of an abandoned rail line that has since been reactivated as the County-owned Hoosier Southern Rail Road. Managed by the Perry County Port Authority, the 22-mile (35 km) short-line rail road connects the Perry County River Port with the Norfolk Southern Rail Road.  Climate and weather In recent years, average temperatures in Tell City have ranged from a low of 24 °F (−4 °C) in January to a high of 88 °F (31 °C) in July, although a record low of −17 °F (−27 °C) was recorded in January 1985, and a record high of 106 °F (41 °C) was recorded in September 1954. Average monthly precipitation ranged from 2.98 inches (76 mm) in October to 5.22 inches (133 mm) in May.  Government The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana, and by the Indiana Code. County Council: The county council is the fiscal body of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes. Board of Commissioners: The executive and legislative body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with managing the day-to-day functions of the county government. Court: The county maintains a small claims court that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of six years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a magistrate who is appointed by the judge. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court. County Officials: The county has several other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare party affiliations and to be residents of the county. With its predominately "butternut" cultural background, Perry County has historically and ancestrally heavily favored the Democratic Party at the federal, state and local level, and had a reputation for being one of the few Democratic-leaning counties in heavily Republican Indiana. From 1960 to 2012, Republicans only carried the county in three presidential elections, those being in 1972, 1984 and 2004, all of which saw the Republicans carry Indiana by landslide margins, and the county was still one of the closest counties in the state in all three elections. The county delivered over 60.5% of its vote to Democratic nominee Barack Obama in 2008, clocking in as the state's fourth most Democratic county that year, before giving Obama nearly 55% of the vote in 2012, being the only county in southern Indiana other than the university county of Monroe to back Obama that year. The county has not backed a Democrat since, with the county delivering 56% of its vote to Republican nominee Donald Trump in 2016 and 61% of its vote to Trump the following election. The county's Republican shift was also shown in the coinciding 2020 gubernatorial election, when it backed Republican incumbent Eric Holcomb for re-election with nearly 64% of the vote, marking the first time a Republican had carried the county in a gubernatorial election since 1952. Perry County is part of Indiana's 8th congressional district and is represented in Congress by Republican Larry Bucshon.  Geography According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of 386.29 square miles (1,000.5 km2), of which 381.73 square miles (988.7 km2) (or 98.82%) is land and 4.56 square miles (11.8 km2) (or 1.18%) is water.

State Road 37 connects the county to Bloomington and Indianapolis. Other state roads in the county include State Road 62, which closely parallels I-64; State Road 145, which winds through the western parts of the county; State Road 166, which is little more than a road to and from the hamlet of Tobinsport; State Road 237, which connects Cannelton directly to State Road 37 (also the site of a bridge on the Ohio River); a short run of State Road 545 near Troy; and State Road 70 which connects State Road 37 with State Road 66.  History Perry County was formed on November 1, 1814 (two years before the state of Indiana was admitted to the Union) from Warrick and Gibson Counties. It was named for Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry who defeated the British squadron in the decisive Battle of Lake Erie in 1813. The Ohio River made Perry County a focal point and settlers were drawn here due to plentiful supplies of natural resources and the area's scenic beauty.

Mariological papal documents have been a major force that has shaped Roman Catholic Mariology over the centuries. Mariology is developed by theologians on the basis not only of Scripture and Tradition but also of the sensus fidei of the faithful as a whole, "from the bishops to the last of the faithful", and papal documents have recorded those developments, defining Marian dogmas, spreading doctrines and encouraging devotions within the Catholic Church. Popes have been highly influential for the development of doctrine and the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary. They made decisions not only in the area of Marian beliefs but also Marian practices and devotions. Before the twentieth century, Popes promulgated Marian veneration and beliefs by authorizing new Marian feast days, prayers, initiatives, and special privileges. Since Pope Leo XIII, Popes have promulgated Mariology also with encyclicals, apostolic letters and  with two dogmas (Immaculate Conception and Assumption). This article reviews the major official teachings by the popes.  Background Historically a Papal bull was "an Apostolic letter with a leaden seal." A papal bull is an official formal decree. In terms of formality, papal bulls and apostolic constitutions are above encyclicals, followed by apostolic letters. An apostolic constitution is the highest level of decree issued by the Pope, and is generally issued as a bull with the requisite formalities regarding seal and signature. By their nature, apostolic constitutions are addressed to the public, whereas encyclicals are usually addressed to patriarchs, primates, archbishops and bishops in communion with the Holy See.  Dogmas The perpetual virginity of Mary Dominici gregis – This papal bull was issued by Pope Clement VIII on 3 February 1603. It considered Marian piety the basis for Church and condemned a number of issues as errors, including the denial of the virginity of Mary.  Mother of God This dogma was proclaimed at the Council of Ephesus in 431 and promulgated by Pope Celestine I. This dogma has attached to it the penalty of an anathema. It was promulgated during the Arian Heresy who state that Mary was just the "Christotokos" (Mother of the Christ) rather than the "Theotokos" (Mother of God)  The Immaculate Conception Cum Praeexcelsa, a bull by Pope Sixtus IV, issued 28 February 1476, when plague was ravaging the country, established a Mass and Office for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. Ubi primum is an encyclical of Pope Pius IX to the bishops of the Catholic Church asking them for opinion on the definition of a dogma on the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. It was issued on 2 February 1849. Ineffabilis Deus – In this key papal bull (the title of which means "ineffable God" in Latin) Pope Pius IX defined ex cathedra the dogma of  the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The decree was promulgated on 8 December 1854, the date of the annual Feast of the Immaculate Conception. The decree surveys the history of the belief, citing its roots in the long-standing feast of the Conception of Mary as a date of significance in the Eastern and Western churches. It also cites the approval of Catholic bishops worldwide who were asked in 1849 to offer their opinion on the matter. (The decree had been preceded by the encyclical Ubi Primum of 2 February 1849 whereby Pius IX solicited the opinions of the bishops of the Catholic Church regarding defining dogma.   Ad diem illum – This encyclical by Pope Pius X on the Immaculate Conception, was given on 2 February 1904, in the first year of his Pontificate. It was issued in commemoration of the fiftieth  anniversary of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. It is an important document because it explains the Mariology of Pope Pius X. One of the reasons the pope gave for writing the encyclical was his desire for the restoration of all things in Christ  which he had defined as his motto Instaurare omnia in Christo: to restore everything in Christ, to whom there is no safer or more direct road than Mary. Fulgens corona – This encyclical by Pope Pius XII was issued on 8 September 1953 on the Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The encyclical proclaimed a Marian year for 1954, to commemorate the centenary of the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. Fulgens corona is significant as it contained the Mariological methodology of Pope Pius XII and his views on limits and challenges of Roman Catholic Mariology.  The Assumption Deiparae Virginis Mariae (1 May 1946) – an encyclical of Pope Pius XII to all Catholic bishops on the possibility of defining the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary as a dogma of faith. Munificentissimus Deus This Apostolic constitution (the title of which means "most bountiful God" in Latin) was issued by Pope Pius XII on 1 November 1950. It defines ex cathedra the dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It is the second ex-cathedra infallible statement ever made by a Pope, the first since the official ruling on Papal Infallibility was made at the First Vatican Council (1869-1870). Following the example of Pius IX, Pope Pius XII issued the encyclical Deiparae Virginis Mariae on issued on 1 May 1946 to all Catholic bishops on the possibility of defining the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary as a dogma of faith.  On Mary as Queen of Heaven Ad Caeli Reginam – This encyclical was issued by Pope Pius XII, on the feast of the Maternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, 11 October 1954. The encyclical is an important element of the Mariology of Pope Pius XII and established the feast Queenship of Mary.  Mary, as intercessor for Peace Auspicia quaedam – Auspicia quaedam is an encyclical of Pope Pius XII published on 1 May 1948, dealing with worldwide public prayers to the Virgin Mary for world peace and the solution of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, given at Rome at St. Peter's, in the tenth year of his pontificate. Christi Matri – an encyclical of Pope Paul VI issued on 15 September 1966, calling for special devotions during the month of October, invoking the intercession of the Blessed Virgin for peace.  On the rosary Consueverunt Romani Pontifices is a papal bull by Pope Pius V issued on 17 September 1569 on the rosary. This papal bull instituted the essence of the rosary's present configuration. Supremi apostolatus officio, issued on 1 September 1883, is the first of Pope Leo XIII's many encyclicals on the Rosary. Superiore anno, encyclical issued on 30 August 1884 by Leo XIII "On the Recitation of the Rosary". Octobri mense is an encyclical on the Rosary by Pope Leo XIII, issued on 22 September 1891. The subject was the power of prayer and the efficacy of the rosary. Ingruentium malorum – This encyclical of Pope Pius XII focused on the rosary. It was given on 15 September, (the Feast of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin Mary), 1951. The encyclical states that from the beginning of his pontificate, Pope Pius XII entrusted  to the Mother of God the destiny of the human family. The Pope strongly supports the idea, that Catholic families should pray the rosary together.  Rosarium Virginis Mariae – This Apostolic Letter by Pope John Paul II was issued on 16 October 2002. It deals with the Holy Rosary and views it as compendium of the Gospel message: The Rosary, though clearly Marian in character, is at heart a Christocentric prayer. In the sobriety of its elements, it has all the depth of the Gospel message in its entirety, of which it can be said to be a compendium. The letter reaffirms the Roman Catholic beliefs on the power of the rosary and states: Through the Rosary the faithful receive abundant grace, as though from the very hands of the Mother of the Redeemer.  Sodality of Our Lady Gloriosae Dominae – by Pope Benedict XIV was issued on 27 September 1748. In this Apostolic Letter Pope Benedict XIV called the Blessed Virgin Mary "Queen of heaven and earth," stating that the sovereign King has in some way communicated to her his ruling power. Bis Saeculari – This Apostolic Constitution Sodality of Our Lady was promulgated by Pope Pius XII on 27 September 1948, the two hundredth anniversary of the Papal bull Gloriosae Dominae of Pope Benedict XIV in 1748. It is important because Apostolic constitutions are the highest form of Papal teaching, above encyclicals, and below dogmatization ex cathedra. The Sodality of Our Lady dates to 1584. It consists of associations of persons, sodalists, dedicated to a Christian life, following the model of the Virgin Mary. In Bis Saeculari, Pope Pius XII pointed to the importance of the Sodality of Our Lady within the Church, which after four hundred years exists in all countries. It has produced virtuous lives among the faithful, priests and saints. It continues to prepare women and men to be active in modern society.  Other documents Signum Magnum – an Apostolic exhortation by Pope Paul VI issued My 13, 1967 on consecration to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Marialis Cultus – Pope Paul VI issued this Apostolic exhortation on 2 February 1974. The letter is subtitled, For the Right Ordering and Development of Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The document does not focus on specific themes in Mariology, but clarifies the way the Roman Catholic Church celebrates liturgies that commemorate Mary and about Marian devotion. The preparation of the document reportedly took four years. Redemptoris Mater – Pope John Paul II delivered this encyclical on 25 March 1987. It is subtitled On the Blessed Virgin Mary in the life of the Pilgrim Church. The encyclical discusses the special place of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the plan of salvation and continues to focus on Mary's role in the Mystery of Christ. In this encyclical Pope John Paul II confirmed the title, Mother of the Church, proclaimed by Pope Paul VI at the Second Vatican Council on 21 November 1964.

Drew Gooden (born October 26, 1993) is an American commentary YouTuber and comedian who makes comedic videos, mainly on internet culture and pop culture. His YouTube channel has over four million subscribers. Before YouTube, Gooden was a Viner best known for his "Road Work Ahead" Vine. He often collaborates with fellow YouTuber Danny Gonzalez; the two went on their We Are Two Different People Tour in 2019. In 2021, Gooden won the Streamy Award for Commentary.  Personal life Drew Gooden was born on October 26, 1993, in North Carolina, and has lived in Orlando, Florida since moving there at a young age. Growing up, Gooden wanted to write for Saturday Night Live. Gooden met Amanda Gooden (née Murphy) in 2015 after she commented on one of his Vines and they started a long-distance relationship for over a year. The two got engaged in 2016 and married on March 10, 2019.  Internet career Vine (2013–2017) After dropping out of community college two times and taking improv classes, Gooden joined Vine, a six-second video platform, in 2013. Gooden's videos ("Vines") were short comedy sketches—his first viral Vine depicted a Venn diagram of him and his favorite shirt, which both had in common a "mortal enemy" in Jeff Daniels. He described Vines as spontaneous, "the video equivalent of a tweet". Gooden created what would become his most popular Vine in 2016. On the way to work in Arizona, he asked his girlfriend to record him driving past a "Road Work Ahead" sign and saying, "Road work ahead? Uh, yeah. I sure hope it does." The meme would later be described as one of the "most recognizable videos on the internet,"  although The Atlantic also called it "passably funny". Gooden remained known for the Vine several years later, calling it his "catchphrase" and selling merchandise based on it; he was recognized at VidCon as the "Road Work Ahead guy". He also found it annoying and wanted to separate himself from the video. According to him, the Vine was never as popular when Vine was still active but spread through Vine compilations on YouTube. Gooden appeared in the Vine-produced web series Camp Unplug (2016), where he first met fellow Viner Danny Gonzalez. By the time Vine closed in January 2017, Gooden had amassed several hundred thousand followers. Besides a small Twitter account, he had no other online followings and decided to migrate to YouTube alongside many other Viners.  YouTube (2017–present) Gooden experimented with different formats and types of videos. As he had wanted to transition to longform content, Gooden's initial idea was to create longer comedy sketches that were similar to his Vines. He eventually settled on being a commentary and reaction YouTuber and his following slowly began to rise again. Gooden's breakout video was a highly critical review of Jake Paul's live show, uploaded in June 2018. Unlike his other videos, which then averaged one hundred thousand views, the review was viewed four million times in one month. He reached one million subscribers in October 2018. Gonzalez also started a commentary channel on YouTube and the two began traveling to appear in each other's videos, becoming close friends. Gooden said that making videos with Gonzalez was more enjoyable because they did not require a script. A running joke between their fans is that they pretend to confuse the two YouTubers together, but as of 2023 neither comedian appreciates this joke. This inspired their We Are Two Different People Tour in 2019, with YouTuber Kurtis Conner as a guest star. The tour, with music, effects, and theatrical elements interspersed with sketches and comedy routines, was their first major live performance and ran from September to October. The two also released a parody song called "We Are Not the Same Person" to promote the tour. Gooden was a Featured Creator at the 10th Annual VidCon. Three years after starting YouTube, Gooden began creating content full-time. In 2021, he won a Streamy Award in Commentary. Gooden was nominated in the same category the next year but lost to Gonzalez.  Content and reception Gooden is a commentary YouTuber. His videos mainly consist of "deep dives" into YouTube, internet, and pop culture. Gooden frequently discusses the difficulties internet celebrities such as Lilly Singh, Jake Paul, and Logan Paul face in breaking into mainstream media. He also covers TikTok creators and makes comedic summaries of poorly received movies.  His videos contain comedic elements and comedy sketches, and are usually filmed in his house. Paste described his videos as his "own comedic version of investigative journalism". He often shares his personal experiences in his videos, and discusses how online trends may be harmful, such as when he examines dangerous videos on YouTube aimed at children. Gooden was criticized by Kaitlyn Tiffany of The Atlantic for an advertisement in the middle of one of his videos, but he has said that he is careful not to be hypocritical as he has criticized celebrities for excessive advertising.

St Mary's Church in Old Dilton, Wiltshire, England was built in the 14th century. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade I listed building, and is now a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.  It was declared redundant on 26 April 1973, and was vested in the Trust on 6 September 1974. The church stands close to the Biss Brook in Old Dilton hamlet, about 1+1⁄2 miles (2.4 km) south-west of the town of Westbury. It was a chapelry of Westbury parish church, as the settlement lay within the ancient parish of Westbury. In the early 19th century, one of the curates assisting the vicar of Westbury was assigned to Old Dilton. When Dilton Marsh civil parish was created in 1894 the boundary followed the Biss, placing the church just within the new parish. The building consists of a nave, chancel, north chapel north aisle and vestry. The gabled south porch is believed to survive from an earlier 14th century building, but the rest of the fabric is 15th century. It has small stone spire at the western end. The interior of the church was renovated in the 18th century and includes box pews, a three-decker pulpit, and two small galleries. The gallery over the north side of the chancel was used as a schoolroom and has a fireplace.  The octagonal stone font is from the 15th century and the Royal Arms of George III can be seen in the chancel. The church has no electricity supply. By the beginning of the 19th century, Dilton had dwindled to a hamlet as the population of Dilton Marsh increased. A church was completed at Dilton Marsh in 1844 and the old church closed in 1900, although it was still used for harvest festivals. Conservation work took place in the 1930s and 1950s, funded by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. The church remains consecrated and the fabric is maintained by the Churches Conservation Trust. Since 2000, further restoration work has sought to resolve issues caused by damp, brown rot, cellar rot and weevils, including the installation of new drains and gutters (for the first time in the church's history). Two services are held at the church each year.

British Chess Magazine is the world's oldest chess journal in continuous publication. First published in January 1881, it has appeared at monthly intervals ever since. It is frequently known in the chess world as BCM. The founder and first general editor of the magazine was John Watkinson (1833–1923). He had previously edited the Huddersfield College Magazine, which was the British Chess Magazine's forerunner. From the beginning, the magazine was devoted to the coverage of chess worldwide, and not just in Great Britain. BCM is an independent and privately owned magazine; it is not owned or run by the former British Chess Federation (now the English Chess Federation), with which its name was occasionally confused, apart from the period August 1981 – July 1992. Apart from being given a new look, the reloaded January 2016 BCM, now in collaboration with Chess Informant, offers more content, more pages and more writers, among them some of the top UK chess grandmasters.

J. C. Séamus Davis is an Irish physicist whose research explores the world of macroscopic quantum physics. Davis concentrates upon the fundamental physics of exotic states of electronic, magnetic, atomic and space-time quantum matter. A specialty is development of innovative instrumentation to allow direct atomic-scale visualization or perception of the quantum many-body phenomena that are characteristic of these states. Davis operates three suites of ultra-low vibration laboratories, one in Beecroft Building at University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, another in the Kane Building at University College Cork in Ireland and a third in Clark Hall at Cornell University in the United States. Other key components of the program are at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Physics of Solids in Germany.  Biography Davis was admitted to University College Cork (UCC) in 1978 and studied physics under Frank Fahy, earning a B.Sc. there in 1983. He got a Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1989, became a postdoctoral research associate there in 1990 and joined the faculty in 1993, rising through the ranks to become a full professor of physics in 2001. From 1998 to 2003, he was also a faculty physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He then joined Cornell University as a professor of physics in 2003, and was appointed J.G. White Distinguished Professor of Physics in 2008. Also in 2007, he became SUPA Distinguished Professor of Physics at the University of St Andrews. He joined Brookhaven National Laboratory in 2007 as a senior physicist, and in 2009 was appointed director of DOE's Center for Emergent Superconductivity, an Energy Frontier Research Center. In 2019 Davis became emeritus professor of physics at Cornell University, NY, US;  professor of quantum physics at University College Cork, Ireland; senior fellow of Wadham College, Oxford, UK; professor of physics at the University of Oxford, UK.  Research Davis' overall interests focus upon macroscopic quantum physics. Active research subjects include studies of:  Macroscopic quantum phenomena Topological superconductors Electron pair density wave states Monopole fluids and insulators Kondo metals and insulators Quantum and classical spin liquids Cu/Fe high-temperature superconductivity Electron fluid-flow visualization Quantum microscope development For these studies, a variety of specialized instrumentation has been developed including scanning tunneling microscopes, quantum interferometers, quantum mechanical oscillators and spin noise spectrometers. The overall strategy is to exploit distinct capabilities and facilities so as to conduct scientifically harmonized studies with complementary scientific instruments at all group locations.  Awards Davis has been the recipient of  Outstanding Performance Award of the Berkeley National Lab. (2001)  Science and Technology Award of Brookhaven National Lab. (2013) Fritz London Memorial Prize (2005) for research on macroscopic quantum physics of superfluids, Kamerlingh Onnes Prize (2009) for research on high temperature superconductivity, Science Foundation Ireland Medal of Science (2016)  Olli V. Lounasmaa Prize (2020) for pioneering research into visualizing electronic quantum matter  Buckley Prize (2023) for innovative visualization of complex quantum states of matter  In 2014 he received an honorary doctorate (D.Sc.) from National University of Ireland. In 2019 he was awarded a Science Foundation Ireland Research Professorship, and in 2020 a Royal Society Research Professorship. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (UK), the American Physical Society (USA), the Max Planck Gesellschaft (DE), the Royal Irish Academy (IE), of the American Association for the Advancement of Science., and a Member of the US National Academy of Sciences.

The Diocese of Fano-Fossombrone-Cagli-Pergola (Latin: Dioecesis Fanensis-Forosemproniensis-Calliensis-Pergulana) is a Latin diocese of the Catholic Church in Italy, created in 1986, when the historical Diocese of Fano was united to the Diocese of Cagli e Pergola and the Diocese of Fossombrone. It is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Pesaro.  History S. Paternianus is credited with being the first Bishop of Fano,  and is supposed  to have been appointed by Pope Sylvester I (314–335). The catalogue of Bishops of Fano before 499 is a recent invention. Eusebius accompanied Pope John I to Constantinople in 524, and may have been killed along with the Pope on their return in 526. Among the later bishops were Riccardo (1214), persecuted by the magistrate Alberghetti; and the Dominican Pietro Bertano (1537), an orator and advocate at the Council of Trent.  Chapter and cathedral In 1111, the cathedral and the Canonica were destroyed by fire. Rebuilding began in 1113. Bishop Carbo was the first to grant the Canons of the cathedral the right to use the title canonicati, on 6 September 1165, and he recognized all their rights and privileges. These had already been confirmed by Pope Eugenius III in 1152, and were confirmed again by Pope Urban III in 1186, by Pope Honorius III in 1218, and by Pope Julius II in 1504. The cathedral Chapter was composed of two dignities (the Provost and the Archdeacon) and twelve Canons, one of whom is called the Poenitentiarius and another the Theologus, as mandated by the Council of Trent. The cathedral is a parish church, and the Provost is the parish priest. One of the chaplains of the cathedral acts as his curate.  Synods A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See. Bishop Giulio Ottinelli (1587–1603) held a diocesan synod in Fano on 16 August 1593. Bishop Angelo Maria Ranuzzi (1678–1688) held a diocesan synod on 30 June 1680. Bishop Taddeo Luigi dal Verme (1688–1696) presided over a diocesan synod on 29 May 1692. On 5 November 1702, Bishop Giovanni Battista Giberti (1696–1720) held a diocesan synod. Bishop Giacomo Beni (1733–1764) held a diocesan synod in 1740.  Reorganization of dioceses In a decree of the Second Vatican Council, it was recommended that dioceses be reorganized to take into account modern developments. A project begun on orders from Pope John XXIII, and continued under his successors, was intended  to reduce the number of dioceses in Italy and to rationalize their borders in terms of modern population changes and shortages of clergy. The change was made urgent because of changes made to the Concordat between the Italian State and the Holy See on 18 February 1984, and embodied in a law of 3 June 1985. The change was approved by Pope John Paul II in an audience of 27 September 1986, and by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops of the Papal Curia on 30 September 1986. The diocese of Fano was united to the dioceses of Cagli e Pergola and of Fossombrone. Its name was to be Fanensis-Forosemproniensis-Calliensis-Pergulanus. The seat of the diocese was to be in Fano. The former cathedral in Cagli and the former cathedral in Fossombrone were to have the honorary title of co-cathedral, and their chapters were to be the Capitulum Concathedralis. There was to be only one episcopal curia, one seminary, one ecclesiastical tribunal; and all the clergy were to be incardinated in the diocese of Fano-Fossombrone-Caglia-Pergola.

Jean-Maurice-Émile Baudot (French: [eˈmil boˈdo]; 11 September 1845 – 28 March 1903), French telegraph engineer and inventor of the first means of digital communication Baudot code, was one of the pioneers of telecommunications.  He invented a multiplexed printing telegraph system that used his code and allowed multiple transmissions over a single line. The baud unit was named after him.  Early life Baudot was born in Magneux, Haute-Marne, France, the son of farmer Pierre Emile Baudot, who later became the mayor of Magneux. His only formal education was at his local primary school, after which he carried out agricultural work on his father's farm before joining the French Post & Telegraph Administration as an apprentice operator in 1869. The telegraph service trained him in the Morse telegraph and also sent him on a four-month course of instruction on the Hughes printing telegraph system, which was later to inspire his own system. After serving briefly during the Franco-Prussian War, he returned to civilian duties in Paris in 1872.  Telegraphy The Telegraph Service encouraged Baudot to develop—on his own time—a system for time-multiplexing several telegraph messages using Hughes teleprinters. He realised that with most printing telegraphs of the period the line is idle for most of the time, apart from the brief intervals when a character is transmitted. Baudot devised one of the first applications of time-division multiplexing in telegraphy. Using synchronized clockwork-powered switches at the transmitting and receiving ends, he was able to transmit five messages simultaneously; the system was officially adopted by the French Post & Telegraph Administration five years later. Baudot invented his telegraph code in 1870  and patented it in 1874. It was a 5-bit code, with equal on and off intervals, which allowed telegraph transmission of the Roman alphabet, punctuation and control signals. By 1874 or 1875 (various sources give both dates) he had also perfected the electromechanical hardware to transmit his code. His inventions were based on the printing mechanism from Hughes' instrument, a distributor invented by Bernard Meyer in 1871, and the five-unit code devised by Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber. Baudot combined these, together with original ideas of his own, to produce a complete multiplex system.  Baudot system On 17 June 1874 Baudot patented his first printing telegraph (Patent no. 103,898 "Système de télégraphie rapide"), in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Baudot's hardware had three main parts: the keyboard, the distributor, and a paper tape. Each operator - there were as many as four - was allocated a single sector. The keyboard had just five piano type keys, operated with two fingers of the left hand and three fingers of the right hand. The five unit code was designed to be easy to remember. Once the keys had been pressed they were locked down until the contacts again passed over the sector connected to that particular keyboard, when the keyboard was unlocked ready for the next character to be entered, with an audible click (known as the "cadence signal") to warn the operator. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute. The receiver was also connected to the distributor. The signals from the telegraph line were temporarily stored on a set of five electromagnets, before being decoded to print the corresponding character on paper tape. Accurate operation of this system depended on the distributor at the transmitting end keeping in synchronization with the one at the receiving end and operators only sending characters when the contacts passed over their allocated sector. This could be achieved at a speed of 30 wpm by strictly observing the "cadence" of rhythm of the system when the distributor gave the operator the use of the line.  First use The Baudot system was accepted by the French Telegraph Administration in 1875, with the first online tests of his system occurring between Paris and Bordeaux on 12 November 1877. At the end of 1877, the Paris-Rome line, which was about 1,700 kilometres (1,100 mi), began operating a duplex Baudot. The Baudot apparatus was shown at the Paris Exposition Universelle (1878) and won him the Exposition's gold medal, as well as bringing his system to worldwide notice.  Later career After the first success of his system, Baudot was promoted to Controller in 1880, and was named Inspector-Engineer in 1882. In July 1887 he conducted successful tests on the Atlantic telegraph cable between Weston-super-Mare and Waterville, Nova Scotia operated by the Commercial Company, with a double Baudot installed in duplex, the Baudot transmitters and receivers substituted for the recorder. On 8 August 1890 he established communications between Paris, Vannes, and Lorient over a single wire. On 3 January 1894 he installed a triplex apparatus on the telegraph between Paris and Bordeaux that had previously been operating with some difficulty on the Hughes telegraph system. On 27 April 1894 he established communications between the Paris stock exchange and the Milan stock exchange, again over a single wire, using his new invention, the retransmitter. In 1897 the Baudot system was improved by switching to punched tape, which was prepared offline like the Morse tape used with the Wheatstone and Creed systems. A tape reader, controlled by the Baudot distributor, then replaced the manual keyboard. The tape had five rows of holes for the code, with a sixth row of smaller holes for transporting the tape through the reader mechanism. Baudot's code was later standardised as International Telegraph Alphabet Number One. Baudot received little help from the French Telegraph Administration for his system, and often had to fund his own research, even having to sell the gold medal awarded by the 1878 Exposition Universelle in 1880. The Baudot telegraph system was employed progressively in France, and then was adopted in other countries, Italy being the first to introduce it, in its inland service, in 1887. The Netherlands followed in 1895, Switzerland in 1896, and Austria and Brazil in 1897. The British Post Office adopted it for a simplex circuit between London and Paris during 1897, then used it for more general purposes from 1898. In 1900 it was adopted by Germany, by Russia in 1904, the British West Indies in 1905, Spain in 1906, Belgium in 1909, Argentina in 1912, and Romania in 1913.  Final years Baudot married Marie Josephine Adelaide Langrognet on 15 January 1890.  She died only three months later, on 9 April 1890. Soon after starting work with the telegraph service, Baudot began to suffer physical discomfort and was frequently absent from work for this reason, for as long as a month on one occasion. His condition affected him for the rest of his life, until he died on 28 March 1903, at Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine, near Paris, at the age of 57.  Mimault patent suit In 1874, French telegraph operator Louis Victor Mimault patented a telegraph system using five separate lines to transmit. After his patent was rejected by the Telegraph Administration, Mimault modified his device to incorporate features from the Meyer telegraph and obtained a new patent which was also rejected. In the meantime, Baudot had patented his prototype telegraph a few weeks earlier. Mimault claimed priority of invention over Baudot and brought a patent suit against him in 1877. The Tribunal Civil de la Seine, which reviewed testimony from three experts unconnected with the Telegraph Administration, found in favor of Mimault and accorded him priority of invention of the Baudot code and ruled that Baudot's patents were simply improvements of Mimault's. Neither inventor was satisfied with this judgment, which was eventually rescinded with Mimault being ordered to pay all legal costs. Mimault became unnerved because of the decision, and after an incident where he shot at and wounded two students of the École Polytechnique (charges for which were dropped), he demanded a special act to prolong the duration of his patents, 100,000 Francs, and election to the Légion d'honneur. A commission directed by Jules Raynaud (head of telegraph research) rejected his demands. Upon hearing the decision, Mimault shot and killed Raynaud, and was sentenced to 10 years of forced labour and 20 years of exile.  Honors 1881 - Diploma of Honor from the International Electrical Exposition. 1882 - Gold medal from the Société d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale (SEIN) 1889 - Ampere Medal from SEIN 1878 - Knight's Cross of the Légion d'honneur 1882 - Knight of the Order of Leopold 1884 - Knight of the Order of Franz Joseph of Austria. 1891 - Cross of the Order of the Crown of Italy 1898 - Promoted to Officier of the Légion d'honneur 1900 - Knight of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (Italy) 1901 - Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy A street in the 17th arrondissement of Paris was named after Baudot, but it no longer exists. In 1926 the International Telegraph Communications Advisory Committee of the International Telecommunication Union met in Berlin and immortalized Baudot by designating the baud - shortened from his name - as the unit of telegraph transmission speed. In 1949, the French Post Office issued a series of stamps with his portrait. By mistake, the year of his birth was given as 1848, not the correct 1845. The stamp was corrected and reprinted with a different color. However, the erroneous stamps still circulate among philatelists and have greater value than the corrected stamps.

Salomon Mikhailovich Flohr (November 21, 1908 – July 18, 1983) was a Czechoslovak and Soviet chess player and writer. He was among the first recipients of the title International Grandmaster from FIDE in 1950. Flohr dominated many tournaments of the pre-World War II years, and by the late 1930s was considered a contender for the World Championship. However, his patient, positional style was overtaken by the sharper, more tactical methods of the younger Soviet echelon after World War II.  Early life Flohr had a troubled childhood beset by personal crises. He was born in a Jewish family in Horodenka in what was then Galicia, Austria-Hungary (now in Ukraine). He and his brother were orphaned during World War I when their parents were killed in a massacre, and they fled to the newly formed nation of Czechoslovakia. Flohr settled in Prague, gradually acquiring a reputation as a skilled chess player by playing for stakes in the city's many cafés. During 1924, he participated in simultaneous exhibitions by Richard Réti and Rudolf Spielmann, and he was still giving displays well into his seventies.  Early successes Flohr won the Kautsky Memorial tournaments of 1928 and 1929 which were held in Prague, and made his international debut at the Rohitsch-Sauerbrunn (Rogaška Slatina) tournament in Slovenia, where he finished second to Akiba Rubinstein in the latter's final success. Flohr had also taken a job as a chess journalist; one of his first assignments was to cover the 1928 Berlin tournament, during which he continued to win money on the side by playing chess.  World title contender Flohr's playing ability peaked in the mid-1930s, when he became one of the world's strongest players and a leading contender for the World Championship. He became champion of Czechoslovakia in 1933 and 1936 and played in many tournaments throughout Europe, generally finishing amongst the top three. Notable victories were at Bad Sliač in 1932, where he shared first place with Milan Vidmar; Scheveningen in 1933; Bad Liebenwerda in 1934 with 9½/11; Barcelona in 1935 where he tied for first with George Koltanowski; Moscow 1935 where he tied for first place with future World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik; Poděbrady in 1936 with the score of +10 −1 =6; and Kemeri in 1937 where he shared the top spot with Vladimir Petrov and Samuel Reshevsky. During this period, he had several other notable high finishes, such as Bern 1932 (tied for second with 11½/15, after World Champion Alexander Alekhine); Zürich 1934 (tied for second with 12/15, again trailing Alekhine); and Pärnu 1937 (second behind Paul Felix Schmidt). Flohr also frequently visited England, regularly playing in the Hastings tournaments of the 1930s. He finished first in 1931/32, 1932/33 and 1933/34, he finished in a tie for first place with Max Euwe and Sir George Thomas in 1934/35, and he was second behind Reuben Fine in 1935/36. He also won the Margate tournament of 1936 ahead of former World Champion José Raúl Capablanca. Flohr became a national hero in Czechoslovakia during the 1930s. His name was used to sell many of the luxury products of the time, including Salo Flohr cigarettes, slippers and eau-de-cologne.  Excels in Chess Olympiads His form for his adopted country in the Chess Olympiads was equally impressive, according to the comprehensive Olympiad site olimpbase.org. He made his debut at Hamburg 1930 on board one, scoring 14½/17 for the silver medal. On home soil at Prague 1931, again on board one, he scored 11/18, and led Czechoslovakia to a team bronze medal. At Folkestone 1933, he again played board one, scored 9/14, helped Czechoslovakia win the team silver medal, and earned a bronze medal for himself. At Warsaw 1935, on board one he scored an undefeated 13/17 for another individual gold medal, and Czechoslovakia finished fifth. Then at Stockholm 1937, once again on board one, he scored 12½/16 for a third individual gold medal. In five Olympiads, he won two individual gold medals, a silver and a bronze. His aggregate was 60/82, for a 73% score against the top players in the world.  Match results Flohr enjoyed a fair amount of success in match play.  He played matches with two of his main rivals for the right to challenge reigning champion Alexander Alekhine. He tied a 16-game match against Euwe in 1932 (+3 −3 =10), and he tied a match against Botvinnik in 1933 (+2 −2 =8). Flohr beat Gösta Stoltz by 5½–2½ in 1931, and a year later he beat Mir Sultan Khan, the 1932 and 1933 British Champion, by 3½–2½. Flohr also defeated Johannes van den Bosch at The Hague in 1932 by 6–2. In 1933, he won two matches in Switzerland, first over Oskar Naegeli by 4–2 at Bern, and then by 4½–1½ over Henri Grob at Arosa.  Official challenger, war years Flohr had married in 1935. By 1937, FIDE had nominated him as the official candidate to play Alekhine for the World Championship. However, with World War II looming, it proved impossible for Flohr to raise the stake money in Czechoslovakia, so the plans were dropped. The next year, Flohr was one of the eight elite players invited to the great AVRO tournament of November 1938. He finished last, and this put an end to his chances of a World Championship match with Alekhine. AVRO may have been the only time in chess history when the top eight players in the world contested an important tournament. While AVRO was a strong tournament and Flohr's last-placed finish was no disgrace, his result may also be explained by his difficult personal circumstances at the time. The German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938 had left Flohr, as a Polish-Ukrainian Jew, in grave personal danger. Flohr remained in the Netherlands in early 1939, playing in several small events. He tied for first place in Amsterdam KNSB with Max Euwe and László Szabó at 3½/5. He tied third/fourth place in Amsterdam VARA with 3/5, as Euwe and Salo Landau won. He won Baarn I with 2½/3. Then, he and his family fled, first to Sweden, and then to Moscow with the help of his friend Botvinnik. While in Sweden, he tied for first place at Gothenburg with Rudolf Spielmann with 10 points out of 11.  Soviet citizen, recovers form Flohr was able to recover his form after reaching safety in Moscow. He won Kemeri 1939 with a score of 12/15. He also won the strong 1939 Leningrad/Moscow tournament with 12/17. He tied for second place at Margate 1939 with 6½/9 behind Paul Keres.  He then tied for second at Bournemouth 1939 with 8½/11, behind former World Champion Euwe. Flohr did not play in any official strong Soviet events from 1940–42, though he did lose a 1942 match to Vladimir Makogonov in Baku by 2–0. He became a naturalized Soviet citizen in 1942, and developed his writing career in his new country, contributing articles to Soviet newspapers and magazines including Ogonek. As the Soviet Union first stopped then reversed the Axis invasion, some chess activity started up again, and in 1943 Flohr won a small but strong tournament in Baku. In 1944 he was again victorious in a Bolshevik Society tournament at Kyiv, tied with Alexei Sokolsky. He withdrew from the 1945 USSR Championship after only three games. After the war, he was still a contender for a possible World Championship match. He finished 6th at the 1948 Interzonal in Saltsjöbaden, thereby qualifying for the 1950 Candidates Tournament in Budapest. However, he finished joint last with 7 out of 18, and never entered the World Championship cycle again, concentrating on journalism. He also developed a role as a chess organiser. He did play periodically at high levels, both within the Soviet Union and abroad, with some success, until the late 1960s. He was awarded the title of International Arbiter in 1963. Flohr died in Moscow on July 18, 1983.  Achievements and legacy Flohr was one of Czechoslovakia's greatest chess players ever and proved virtually invincible at the Olympiads of the 1930s. His tournament record was impressive, with his tactical skill and excellent endgame technique securing him many famous victories. FIDE awarded him the International Grandmaster title on its inaugural list in 1950. He made some important contributions to opening theory: a 'Flohr variation' can be found in six major openings, including the Caro–Kann Defence, the Ruy Lopez, the English Opening, and the Grünfeld Defence. The Flohr–Zaitsev Variation of the Closed Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 Bb7 10.d4 Re8) was successfully adopted by World Champion Anatoly Karpov in the 1980s. Flohr was primarily a strategist who excelled in the endgame.  He favoured the closed game with White, and during the prime of his career, he was especially deadly with the Queen's Gambit, as the game selection shows. Flohr almost never opened with 1.e4. He was one of the main developers of the Caro–Kann, which was an obscure and poorly regarded line as late as the 1920s when Flohr adopted it. The Second World War killed any chance he had of winning the world title, and the stress of becoming a refugee for the second time in his life affected his style of play. He became a much more cautious player in his post-war games and earned a drawish reputation, with many short draws which were hardly contested. Players such as Vasily Smyslov, David Bronstein, Isaac Boleslavsky, Paul Keres, Alexander Kotov, Tigran Petrosian, Efim Geller, Mark Taimanov, Yuri Averbakh, Boris Spassky, Mikhail Tal, Viktor Korchnoi, and Leonid Stein dominated the landscape with their sharper styles and innovative openings. Flohr was never able to defeat Alekhine head-to-head, losing five games and drawing seven in their 12 encounters. Alekhine had a sharp, tactical style, and he could also play outstanding positional chess. According to the site Chessmetrics.com, which compares historical ratings, Flohr was among the world's top 20 players from 1930 to 1951, except for the war years 1942–44 when he was largely inactive; and his ranking peaked at No. 2 in the world in 1935.[1]  Notable games Salo Flohr vs Max Euwe, Amsterdam / Karlsbad match 1932, Queen's Gambit, Exchange Variation (D36), 1–0 Virtually perfect game by White showing optimal strategy in this variation. Mikhail Botvinnik vs Salo Flohr, Leningrad / Moscow match 1933, Caro–Kann Defence, Panov–Botvinnik Attack (B13), 0–1 Botvinnik adopts his favourite line, but has to concede defeat. Salo Flohr vs Isaac Kashdan, Folkestone Olympiad 1933, English Opening, Flohr–Mikenas Attack (A18), 1–0 Flohr adopts one of the lines which will eventually bear his name, with good success here. Salo Flohr vs Paul Keres, Warsaw Olympiad 1935, Queen's Gambit Declined, Exchange Variation (D37), 1–0 Keres was the 19-year-old new star making his international debut, but he is out of his league here. Salo Flohr vs J.R. Capablanca, Nottingham 1936, Queen's Gambit Declined, Tartakower Variation (D59), 1–0 Even the phenomenal Capablanca, former World Champion and joint winner of Nottingham, can't defend against Flohr's Queen's Gambit. Salo Flohr vs Emanuel Lasker, Moscow 1936, Reti Opening (A06), 1–0 Solid positional performance in one of the fashionable hypermodern variations. David Bronstein vs Salo Flohr, USSR Championship, Moscow 1944, Ruy Lopez, Open Variation (C82), 0–1 The 20-year-old Bronstein was making his debut at the top Soviet level, but learns a lesson here. Salo Flohr vs Tigran Petrosian, USSR Championship, Moscow 1949, Old Indian Defence (A54), 1–0 The 20-year-old Petrosian was making his debut at the top Soviet level, and learns a positional lesson. Salo Flohr vs Efim Geller, USSR Championship, Moscow 1950, Reti Opening (A05), 1–0 Another young Master learns that the veteran Flohr still packs a punch. Leonid Stein vs Salo Flohr, Ukrainian Championship, Kyiv 1957, Caro–Kann Defence, Flohr–Smyslov Modern Variation (B17), 0–1 Another smooth positional massage from the Master of the 'Roach'. Salo Flohr vs Bent Larsen, Noordwijk 1965, Sicilian Defence, Accelerated Dragon Variation (B39), 1–0 Flohr takes off one of the Candidates of that time in his last great victory.

Harold G. Stoner (1890–1971) was an American architect who helped define the unique architectural style of San Francisco's west of Twin Peaks district. Born in Brighton, England, he left for Regina, Canada, to pursue a career in architecture. After working for the provincial government and completing his advanced education, he obtained an apprenticeship in 1913 with the notable architectural firm led by F. Chapman Clemesha and Frank H. Portnall. Two years later, Mr. Stoner arrived in the San Francisco Bay area and began working for architect Charles McCall in Oakland.  As Mr. Stoner's career progressed, he worked as the chief architect for Lang Brothers Realty. In addition to many beautiful homes west of Twin Peaks and elsewhere in the Bay Area, Mr. Stoner designed the Carolands Gatehouse as well as the 'Tropic Beach' façade of the Sutro Baths and the building that housed Sally Rand's Nude Ranch at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exhibition on Treasure Island. A veteran of World War I, Stoner was not only associated with some of the Bay Area's most historic events, places, and figures, but was responsible for creating some of its most charming architecture, including four San Francisco Chronicle model homes toured by thousands in the 1920s. His artistic designs graced the covers of Walter Dixon's Home Designer and Garden Beautiful Magazine and were featured on the Golden Gate International Exposition Model Home Tour in 1939. A master of Period Revival designs, including what we now call Storybook style, he excelled at all phases of the Bay Area architectural tradition, from collaboration with noted landscape architect Thomas Church, to creating what renowned architectural historian David Gebhard lauded as “one of the country’s most elegant Art Deco designs.”.   == References ==

The Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame (CWHF) recognizes women natives or residents of the U.S. state of Connecticut for their significant achievements or statewide contributions. The CWHF had its beginnings in 1993 when a group of volunteers partnered with Hartford College for Women to establish an organization to honor distinguished contributions by female role models associated with Connecticut. The first list of inductees contained forty-one women notable to Connecticut's history and culture, many of whom broke down barriers by becoming the first women to establish themselves in fields that had been previously denied to their gender.   Alice Paul, who had a role in the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and later wrote the first version of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, was on the 1994 list of women. Also on that first list were actress Katharine Hepburn and her mother Katharine Martha Houghton Hepburn, who was a pioneer in women's rights and planned parenthood issues. Three of the Beecher clan are on that first list, Hartford Female Seminary founder Catharine Beecher, suffragist Isabella Beecher Hooker, and abolitionist author Harriet Beecher Stowe. Governor Ella T. Grasso was honored in 1994, as was Estelle Griswold, whose landmark Griswold v. Connecticut before the United States Supreme Court resulted in Connecticut's anti-birth control statute being declared unconstitutional. In the ensuing two decades, the list has more than doubled. Artist Laura Wheeler Waring, who found fame by creating portraits of prominent African Americans during the Harlem Renaissance, was added in 1997. Abstract artist Helen Frankenthaler became part of the list in 2005. African American opera divas are on the list, Marian Anderson in 1994 and Rosa Ponselle in 1998. Ambassador, politician and playwright Clare Boothe Luce's 1994 appearance on the list was later joined by 19th century free black woman journalist Maria W. Stewart in 2001 and by war correspondent and human rights activist Jane Hamilton-Merritt in 1999.  In 2008, the list gained Nobel Prize in Medicine winner, geneticist Barbara McClintock. The Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction winner Annie Dillard was added to the list in 1997. The CWHF provides educational resources through two traveling exhibits, the Inductee Portrait Exhibit, and its We Fight For Roses, Too, a set of twenty-two standing panels displaying the stories of the inductees. The CWHF also provides speakers upon request.  Inductees Footnotes References Chung, King-Thom (2009). Women Pioneers of Medical Research: Biographies of 25 Outstanding Scientists.

Tent City (Tent siti) is a suburb of Lae in the Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. The main campus for the Papua New Guinea University of Technology is located 1 kilometre to the South of Tent City.  Location Tent City is located 9 km North of Lae on Independence Drive up the road from the University of Technology and to the North East of East Taraka.  History of Tent City Between December 1983 and July 1992, Lae experienced two major flood and mudslide disasters. In both cases, hundreds of people lost their homes. The 1983 floods remain the worst since the establishment of the town in the late 1920s. These floods left hundreds of people homeless particularly those living along the banks of the Bumbu River. Many houses were damaged or completely destroyed and hundreds of people at the Five Mile settlement along the Highland highway were also affected by mud-slides. Meanwhile, provincial and national leaders met to find solutions to the problem of how to resettle people displaced by the disaster and to the north of the city a block of land was allocated, planned and developed for the resettlement of the disaster victims. This 'Tensiti' settlement was developed in 1992 on the former Serafini plantation with sealed road networks, water and electricity  Housing In May 1992, a study examined migrant settlement in and around Lae examining Tent Siti and West Taraka.  Tent Siti Tensiti is situated in the northern part of the city and was first formed by people from Menyamya, Morobe Province in 1983. Now this settlement is composed of 30 households from Menyamya, 17 households from the Highlands areas, and 11 households from the Sepik areas. People live on government land and many of them work as wage earners. Examples of their occupations include a provincial officer, an employee of a private company, and a teacher. In addition, some of them are farmers in the city. West Taraka West Taraka is situated in the north-western part of the city, and Boundary Road is situated in the mid-western part of the city. Both have grown rapidly in the 1970's and 1980's by people coming mainly from the Highlands areas. The study found that almost half of the informants (48.5%) came to Lae in the 1980s. The figure is much higher in Mouth Markham (66.7%). East Sepik Province (30.3%) and the provinces in the Highlands (30.3%) stand out as places where the informants lived before they came to Lae. This tendency corresponds to the fact that most respondents were born in the Sepik and Highlands areas and less than half of them have had former migration experiences. In 2011 another study on housing was conducted drawing on the 1973 - 1974 urban household survey which revealed that less than 40% of the urban households had built and owned the houses they lived in.  Five years after the establishment of the National Housing Corporation (NHC), another urban household survey revealed that only 10% of all houses in Lae were either rented or leased directly and the corresponding figure for Port Moresby was 23%  Another study by the Bank of Papua New Guinea examined the demand for urban housing finance which found that two factors discouraged individual investment in urban home-ownership in Papua New Guinea. Firstly the rental housing market in Papua New Guinea was, and still is, heavily subsidised by the government and associated with paying rates, taxes and other regular repair and maintenance costs. Secondly most Papua New Guineans held strong ties with their rural areas and many people were unprepared to sever these ties for several reasons, for instance, fear of being accused by wantoks (relatives and friends) of running away from rural obligations. Public housing in Papua New Guinea is not only unavailable, but also unattainable for a large proportion (60.0%) of the urban population. It is evident that even the 1981 housing policy that encouraged national home-ownership schemes has not significantly increased home-ownership.   == References ==

Wabash Railroad No. 534, also known as Nancy, is the sole survivor of the B-7 class 0-6-0 switcher steam locomotive that was built by the American Locomotive Company in 1906. It was used by the Wabash as a yard switcher, until it was sold in 1954 to the Lake Erie and Fort Wayne Railroad as No. 1. After being retired in 1957, it was donated to Swinny Park in Fort Wayne, Indiana for static display. In 1984, it was purchased by the Fort Wayne Railroad Historical Society, which removed the locomotive from the park and relocated it to their locomotive shop in New Haven. The locomotive is undergoing restoration to operational condition while serving as an educational tool for the younger FWRHS members, as of 2023.  History Revenue service From the late 1880s to the early 1920s, the Wabash Railroad, a class 1 railroad that lied as far east as New York state and as far west as Iowa, ordered multiple classes of 0-6-0 switcher locomotives to add to their locomotive roster. One of the classes was the B-7 class, with forty-two of them being built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the American Locomotive Company (ALCO)'s Rhode Island Locomotive Works between 1906 and 1912, being numbered 525-566, and No. 534 was one of the locomotives built by Alco in August 1906. The locomotive was used by the Wabash for shuttling and simmering various rolling stock between several terminals throughout the states of Illinois and Missouri.  As the railroad was dieselizing their locomotive roster, many of the B-7 class 0-6-0s were either sold for scrap or sold to smaller short-line railroads, and No. 534 was sold in 1954 to one of the Wabash's subsidiaries, the Lake Erie and Fort Wayne Railroad (LE&FW) for $1,500, and it was subsequently renumbered to 1. The LE&FW reassigned the switcher to pull light-weight freight trains out of steel mills in Taylor Street near Fort Wayne, Indiana. By the late 1950s, however, the LE&FW discontinued steam operations, and No. 1 completed its last revenue freight assignment in March 1957 before its fire was dropped for the final time.  Preservation A group of area railroaders convinced the LE&FW to donate No. 1 to Swinny Park in Fort Wayne for static display, since it was one of very few Wabash steam locomotives left at the time. On May 8, 1957, after being repainted, No. 1 was lifted onto a flatbed by a Nickel Plate Road 300-ton steam crane, and then it was moved by truck downtown to its new display site. No. 1 would spend the next eighteen years on static display in Swinny Park in front of Wabash caboose No. 2543. In 1984, the Fort Wayne Railroad Historical Society (FWRHS), a non-profit organization based in nearby New Haven, acquired No. 1 and the caboose as additions to their collection of vintage railroad equipment, and volunteers arrived in Swinny Park that same year to remove the locomotive and caboose from their display site by truck. Upon arrival of New Haven, No. 1 remained sidelined for a future restoration that would revert its identity to Wabash No. 534, but that would not come to fruition for years, since the FWRHS would concentrate their efforts on Nickel Plate Road 2-8-4 No. 765, and for a short time, Chesapeake and Ohio 2-8-4 No. 2716. Beginning in 2009, No. 534 was moved inside the FWRHS's main engine house, and some of their youngest members began cosmetically stabilizing the locomotive for a cleaner appearance, and to get rid of the variety of rust spots the locomotive had been collecting while being stored outdoors over the years. The smokebox was full of rusty crumbs from the smokebox door’s insulation, and rodents and other small animals had to be evicted from inside the locomotive, so that the crew would proceed with the work. Progress was slow, but still productive, since by 2013, the locomotive's boiler received a much smoother surface. As of 2023, work slowly continues to proceed with No. 534's restoration for operational purposes. The tender remains deteriorated without any trucks, the cab was completely refurbished and reinstalled onto the locomotive, and both the builder's plate and the original Wabash number plate were remade. One of the reasons why this is a slow process is because No. 534 is meant to serve as an educational tool for the youngest members of the FWRHS, since most of them aren't legally of age to help work with No. 765. The date of the locomotive ever steaming up again has yet to be determined.  Historical significance No. 534 is the sole survivor of the B-7 class, and it is one of only two preserved steam locomotives that were ever used by the Wabash. The only other survivor is 2-6-0 No. 573, which is homed at the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis. No. 534 is also one of the oldest preserved steam locomotives in the state of Indiana.

The 1994 Quebec general election was held on September 12, 1994, to elect members of the National Assembly of Quebec. The Parti Québécois, led by Jacques Parizeau, defeated the incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Premier Daniel Johnson Jr. Johnson had succeeded Robert Bourassa as Liberal leader and Premier. Both his father, Daniel Sr., and brother, Pierre-Marc, had previously served as premiers of Quebec as leaders of different parties. The election set the stage for the 1995 Quebec referendum on independence for Quebec from Canada. The referendum would see the PQ government's proposals for sovereignty very narrowly defeated. Mario Dumont, a former president of the Liberal party's youth wing, and then leader of the newly formed Action démocratique du Québec, won his own seat, but no other members of his party were elected.

Tula (Russian: Тула, IPA: [ˈtulə]) is the largest city and the administrative center of Tula Oblast in Russia, located 193 kilometers (120 mi) south of Moscow. Tula is located in the northern Central Russian Upland on the banks of the Upa River, a tributary of the Oka. At the 2010 census, Tula had a population of 501,169, an increase from 481,216 in 2002, making it the 32nd-largest city in Russia by population.A primarily industrial city, Tula was a fortress at the border of the Principality of Ryazan. The city was seized by Ivan Bolotnikov during the Time of Troubles and withstood a four-month siege by the Tsar's army. Historically, Tula has been a major centre for the manufacture of armaments. The Demidov family built the first armament factory in Russia in the city, in what would become the Tula Arms Plant, which still operates to this day. Tula is home to the Klokovo air base, Tula State University, the Tula Kremlin, Tula State Museum of Weapons, and Kazanskaya Embankment. Tula has a historical association with the samovar, a metal container used to heat and boil water; the city was a major center of Russian samovar production. Yasnaya Polyana, the former home of the writer Leo Tolstoy, is located 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) southwest of Tula. Additionally, Tula is known for its imprinted gingerbread (pryanik), which has been made in Tula since the 17th century.  Etymology The name of the city is likely  pre-Russian, probably of Baltic origin.  History Tula was first mentioned in the Nikon Chronicle (year 1146). In the Middle Ages, Tula was a minor fortress at the border of the Principality of Ryazan. As soon as it passed to the Grand Duchy of Moscow, a brick citadel, or kremlin, was constructed in 1514–1521. It was a key fortress of the Great Abatis Belt and successfully resisted a siege by the Tatars in 1552. In 1607, Ivan Bolotnikov and his supporters seized the citadel and withstood a four-months siege by the Tsar's army. In the 18th century, some parts of the kremlin walls were demolished. Despite its archaic appearance, the five-domed Assumption Cathedral in the kremlin was built as late as 1764. In 1712, Tula was visited by Peter the Great, who commissioned the Demidov blacksmiths to build the first armament factory in Russia. Several decades later, Tula was turned by the Demidovs into the greatest ironworking center of Eastern Europe. The oldest museum in the city, showcasing the history of weapons, was inaugurated by the Demidovs in 1724, and Nicholas-Zaretsky Church in the city houses their family vault. The first factory to produce samovars industrially was also established there in the course of the 18th century. After the Demidovs moved the center of their manufacture to the Urals, Tula continued as a center of heavy industry, particularly in the manufacture of matériel. In the 1890s, Ivan Savelyev, a medical orderly, became the founder of social democracy in Tula and set up a workers' study circle. During World War II, the city was important in the production of armaments. Tula became the target of a German offensive to break Soviet resistance in the Moscow area between 24 October and 5 December 1941. According to Erik Durschmied in The Weather Factor: How Nature has Changed History, one German general reached the southwestern outskirts of Tula on 29–30 October 1941.   The heavily fortified city held out, however, and Guderian's Second Panzer Army was stopped near Tula. The city secured the southern flank during the Battle of Moscow and the subsequent counter-offensive. Tula was awarded the title Hero City in 1976. It is home to the Klokovo air base and the Tula Arms Plant.  Administrative and municipal status Tula serves as the administrative center of the oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Tula City Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the territories of Tula City Under Oblast Jurisdiction and of Leninsky District are incorporated as Tula Urban Okrug.

"Zing a Little Zong" is a popular song written by Harry Warren, the lyrics by Leo Robin. The song was published in 1952 and written for the 1952 movie Just for You where it was performed by Bing Crosby and Jane Wyman.  It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song of 1952 but lost out to "High Noon". The Decca record by Crosby and Wyman was cut on May 8, 1952 and was in the Billboard charts for six weeks with a peak position of #18. The Billboard review of "Zing" was enthusiastic. "Bing Crosby and Jane Wyman team up for a sock waxing of this cute novelty ditty from their flick “Just for You”. Bing sounds more relaxed than he has in a long time and the thrush carries her part in fine fashion. The Jud Conlon Rhythmaires help out spiritedly. Side should get a lot of plays and spins due to impact of movie." Leo Robin wrote an opening verse, which was not used in the film or the commercial recording, but does help to set the scene and explain the use of the last letter of the alphabet. "Let's imagine we’re in Holland and we’re underneath the moon, Let's walk a little, talk a little, kiss a little, Cling a little, sigh a little, sing a little tune…" Crosby also performed the song with his White Christmas co-star Rosemary Clooney. Helen O'Connell was another who recorded the song in 1952. Versions of "Zing a Little Zong" have been featured on the soundtracks for several subsequent films, such as Brooklyn and Final Score.   == References ==

Cilus, is a monospecific genus of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Sciaenidae, the croakers and drums. Its only species is Cilus gilberti, the corvina or corvina drum, which is found mostly tropical to temperate coastal waters of the southeastern Pacific along Central and South America. The corvina is highly prized in South America as a food fish.  Taxonomy Cilus was first proposed as a monospecific genus in 1900 by the Chilean ichthyologist Federico Teobaldo Delfin when he described Cilus montti, which had a type localities given as Talcahuano, San Vicente and Concepción, Chile, as its only species. It was later established that Delfin's species was a synonym of Charles C. Abbott's Sciaena gilberti which Abbott had described in 1899 from Callao in Peru. This taxon belongs to the family Sciaenidae in the order Acanthuriformes.  Etymology Cilus is derived from cilonus which means "one with a long and narrow head", an allusion to the long and compressed head of this species. The fish was given the species name gilberti by Charles Conrad Abbott, in honour of “friend and instructor” Charles Henry Gilbert.  Description The corvina is similar in appearance to its relatives the weakfish and spotted seatrout. Its body is blue-grey on top, silvery overall with small scales, and is elongated and somewhat compressed in shape. It has a large mouth and a dorsal fin that is deeply notched between spiny and soft parts. It reaches 40 cm (16 in) or more.  Range and habitat The corvina is found along the South American Pacific coastline from Chile to Panama, and also in the Galapagos. It inhabits soft bottoms at a depth of 5 to 50 m (16 to 164 ft).  Culinary uses The corvina has a white and flaky texture and a mild, sweet taste. Cooking methods include grilled, baked, fried, and sashimi. It is a popular choice in ceviche.   == References ==

"Wow" (stylized as "Wow.") is a song by American rapper and singer Post Malone, released as the lead single from his third studio album, Hollywood's Bleeding (2019), via Republic Records on December 24, 2018. The song was written by Malone alongside Billy Walsh, Anthoine Walters, Carl Rosen, and producers Louis Bell and Frank Dukes. "Wow" peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, Post Malone’s sixth top 10 hit.  Background Post Malone stated earlier in December that he wished to release another "body of work" before the year was over; his previous single was "Sunflower" with Swae Lee, the lead single from the December 2018 movie Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse soundtrack. The song, released on Christmas Eve, was accompanied with an animated Christmas-themed visualizer which premiered on Malone's YouTube channel the same day. Lyrically, "Wow" discusses Malone's climb to fame, wealth, and success while emceeing a club environment.  Composition "Wow" is written in the key of F-sharp minor at a tempo of 100 beats per minute.  Critical reception HipHop-N-More stated that the song felt like "more than just a throwaway", saying it "could be another big moment for Post on the charts and radio". NME called it one of Post Malone's "most stripped back recordings to date", saying his rapping over a beat is a "stark contrast" to his previous Autotuned vocals and "heavily produced" music. Billboard magazine said the song "bounces along on a tick-tock beat and deep bass thrum", further describing the song as a chronicle of Post's rise to fame.  Accolades Commercial performance "Wow." debuted at number 47 on the Billboard Hot 100. In its third week, it moved up to number 11 before ascending to the top 10, where it peaked at number two, being held off the top spot by "7 Rings" by Ariana Grande on April 6, 2019. It fell to number four the following week. Two weeks later it rose again to its peak of number two, this time blocked by the remix of "Old Town Road" by Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, remaining there for another week, totaling three non-consecutive weeks in the runner-up spot. It remained in the top ten for 24 consecutive weeks.  Remix The official remix of the song, featuring Compton, Californian  rappers Roddy Ricch and Tyga, premiered on March 15, 2019. There are two versions of audio for the remix. One is the explicit version and the other is the clean edited version, which appears on the various artists compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 71 (2019) in the United States.

Music video The music video for "Wow." was released on March 19, 2019, on Malone's YouTube channel. The "video blog-styled" video features footage of Malone with Red Hot Chili Peppers, DJ Khaled and Mike Alancourt. The video was directed by James DeFina. It has a viewing of 308 million on YouTube as of June 15, 2023.

The Northern Dry Pacific Coast mangroves ecoregion (WWF ID: NT1425) covers the mangrove habitats in a series of sites along the Pacific Ocean coast of Guatemala and El Salvador.  This part of Central America is relatively dry compared to higher elevations or more southerly areas, so the wetland mangroves serve as a refuge for animals of the interior during the winter dry season.  The mangroves only extend a few kilometers inland to where the salt water influence is gone; the ecoregion surrounding the mangroves is the Central American dry forests ecoregion.  Location and description The individual mangrove sites are on the brackish margins of lagoons, bays, and river estuaries.  Individual sites include: Rio Paz, Rio Acome and Rio Lempa estuaries and behind Barra de Santiago and Monterrico Lagoons.  Coastal Retalhuleu Department, Guatemala Coastal Escuintla Department, Guatemala Coastal Santa Rosa Department, Guatemala Los Esclavos River estuary at the lagoon of Sipacate, Guatemala Acomé River estuary, in Escuintla Department of Guatemala The lagoon behind Barra de Santiago, which receives runoff from the mountains inland Estero de Jaltepeque, a lagoon 5 km west of the mouth of the Lempa River Jiquilisco Bay, towards the east end of the El Salvador coast, is a biosphere reserve and a RAMSAR wetland of international importance.  Climate The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification (Am)).  This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year (all months being greater than 18 °C (64 °F) average temperature), and a pronounced dry season.  The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, but more than (100-(average/25) mm.  This climate is mid-way between a tropical rainforest and a tropical savannah.  The dry months are in the winter.  Flora and fauna The mangroves in this ecoregion are more less fully developed than those farther south because of the lower precipitation.  Mangrove trees in the ecoregion are characteristically red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), Rhizophora harrisonii, and Rhizophora racemosa.  There are also stands of white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa) and button mangrove (Conocarpus erectus).  Black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) and Avicennia bicolor may be found on higher, clay soils.  Protected areas Officially protected areas in the ecoregion include:  Bahia Jiquilisco Biosphere Reserve Biotopo Monterrico-Hawaii   == References ==

Flying Cadets is a 1941 American adventure film directed by Erle C. Kenton and written by George Waggner, Roy Chanslor and Stanley Rubin. The film stars William Gargan, Edmund Lowe, Peggy Moran, Frank Albertson, Frankie Thomas and Riley Hill. Flying Cadets was released on October 24, 1941, by Universal Pictures.  Plot At the Monarch Airport, Bob Ames (Frank Albertson) is excited his new flight school to train future military pilots, is ready to open. His partner, "Trip Hammer" (William Gargan), tells him that financing has come from Bob's girl friend, Kitty Randall (Peggy Moran)and her father. Kitty is currently taking flying lessons from Trip. Trip gets a phone call from  Bob's brother, Captain Rodcliffe "Rocky" Ames (Edmund Lowe), a World War I hero now a soldier of fortune, who agrees to help with the flying school, in exchange for Trip taking care of his gambling debts in New York. Trip convinces Bob that the school needs Rocky's name to attract customers, as well as a government training contract. Trip is right, the school begins attracting students from across the country, but Rocky has immediately annoyed Bob when he flirts with Kitty. Rocky takes Kitty up for a flying lesson, but he is forced to make a sensational landing when Kitty breaks off a wheel during a simulated forced landing. With the cadets begin flying training, Bob provides the classroom instruction, Trip the mechanics, and Rocky the flight training. The top student is Newton Adams (Frankie Thomas), Rocky's long-lost son. Trip found out the secret and agrees to keep it to himself. Problems soon arise with Newton having a hard time learning to fly from Rocky, who also is jilted when Kitty declares he is "old enough to be her father." With "Pinkie" Taylor (John Maxwell), a government inspector on the premises, a future aircraft design contract is in jeopardy with Rocky considering quitting to fight in China. Trip accuses him of running away from every responsibility he has ever had and the next morning, a drunken Rocky returns to the flight school. Later, Rocky flies Bob's new experimental design but fears the aircraft is unsafe. If equipped with a parachute to stop spins, it could be made safe to fly. Newton, trying to prove himself to his father, takes the experimental aircraft up. Trip breaks the news to Rocky that the boy is his son. Realizing that inexperienced pilots will die in a spin, Rocky flies to his son, tells him by radio, how to activate the spin 'chute, but Rocky is distracted and crashes. Bob later redesigns his aircraft to be safe and receives a contract from the United States Army Air Corps. Newton graduates, and, with other cadets, goes to enlist at air bases. Rocky recovers from his injuries and is finally reunited with his wife Mary (Louise Lorimer).  Cast Production Flying Cadets  was produced in the years before World War II, when the United States government encouraged Hollywood studios to produce films that would encourage youth to join the resurgent armed forces, especially the U.S. Army Air Corps.  Flying Cadets joined 20,000 Men a Year (1939), I Wanted Wings (1941), Give Us Wings (1940) and others of that genre, as a patriotic "flag-waver". Principal photography on Flying Cadets took place from May 12, to late May 1941. The aircraft featured in the film included:   Stearman C3B Ryan STA Fairchild 24C-8C Brown B-3 Harlow PJC-5 Taylorcraft B  Reception The contemporary film review of Flying Cadets by Bosley Crowther in The New York Times, noted, "For this low-budget Universal picture, which is like a hundred others off the line, is no more than a routine program-filler, no stronger than its weakest cliché, about a free-and-easy old-time flier who teaches at an aviation school and discovers — at the fearful climax, naturally — that his most neglected pupil is his own son." Aviation film historian James M. Farmer in Celluloid Wings: The Impact of Movies on Aviation (1984), had a similar reaction, saying that Flying Cadets (was) "a low-budget formula piece."

Clyde Godfrey Butts (8 July 1957 – 8 December 2023) was a Guyanese cricketer who batted right-handed and bowled off breaks. Later, he became a team selector. In a career spanning 14 seasons, he played 87 first class games, including seven Test matches for the West Indies between 1985 and 1988. He also served as the chairman of West Indies Cricket Board Selection Panel for a brief stint.  Biography Clyde Godfrey Butts was born in a village called Perseverance as the tenth and last child in his family. "On the rest day of his Test debut in April 1985, [Butts] got married, though arguably, for an offspinner in that fearsome West Indies attack, most days were a rest day." Butts died in a road accident in Eccles, East Bank Demerara, on 8 December 2023, at age 66. On 9 December 2023, during the third ODI between the West Indies and England, West Indies players wore black armbands to mourn the deaths of Clyde Butts and Joe Solomon.  Career The West Indies rarely selected spin bowlers when Butts was active – choosing instead to back their four fast bowlers and even ESPN Cricinfo has described the fate of being a West Indian spinner in the 1980s, by comparing it with a trained opera singer in a boy band. He was often sidelined from the West Indies Test team due to the seam bowling attack coupled with the consistent performance of offspinner Roger Harper who was often considered as the first-choice spin bowler for the West Indies test side. He finally received the opportunity to make his test debut during the second Test of the home series  against New Zealand on 6 April 1985 and he endured a tough outing with the ball on debut, conceding 113 runs by bowling 47 overs without taking any wicket. Butts did play five matches on the Indian subcontinent, where teams traditionally select spin bowlers as the pitches are believed to suit them more. It was on the subcontinent that Butts registered his best bowling figures, with four for 73 against Pakistan during the third Test of the series which was played at Karachi in November 1986. He also took the prized wicket of the Pakistani captain and all-rounder Imran Khan and finished with six for 95 in the match, but could not prevent a drawn match and a drawn series. In his next tour of the subcontinent, to India the following season (at the end of December 1986), Butts played three Tests and managed to take only two wickets in the series, and that eventually turned out to be his last series. He also captained Guyana in domestic cricket during the 1980s and predominantly played first-class cricket representing Guyana. Butts was appointed the head coach of the West Indies under-19 cricket team for the 2004 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. In July 2008, he was appointed a national selector and headed the selection panel of Cricket West Indies. During his stint as the chairman of selectors for Cricket West Indies, West Indies emerged triumphant in the final of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. He also occasionally spent his career as a commentator in regional and domestic matches in Guyana.  References External links Clyde Butts at ESPNcricinfo

Der Klassiker in German (The Classic), also known as the "German Clásico", is the name given to any football match between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. They are two of the most successful teams in German football, having won a combined total of 26 of the past 31 Bundesliga titles as of the 2023–24 season. The two teams fought closely for the Bundesliga title in the early 2010s, and met in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final. However, the nature of the rivalry has been called into question, with many disputing the fixture being a "classic" due to there being little historic rivalry between the teams, in contrast to the long history of many other prominent football derbies in Germany, including Dortmund's Revierderby with FC Schalke 04, the various Bavarian football derbies involving Bayern Munich and 1. FC Nürnberg, and the elder 70s rivalry between Bayern Munich and Borussia Mönchengladbach.  History First meeting and mutual successes The first match between the two clubs was a 2–0 win for Dortmund in Munich on 16 October 1965. On 5 May 1966, Dortmund won the 1965–66 European Cup Winners' Cup 2–1 against Liverpool in extra time, becoming the first German club to win a European title. Bayern Munich won the same competition the following season. In 1971, Bayern defeated Dortmund 11–1; this remain's Bayern's biggest Bundesliga victory and Dortmund's second worst defeat, after Dortmund's worst defeat of 12–0 v Borussia Mönchengladbach on 29 April 1978. On the other hand, the highest scoring draw in a Bundesliga match between the two teams occurred on 21 May 1983, when Karl-Heinz Rummenigge scored a late equaliser to save Bayern from a defeat against hosts Dortmund, with a final scoreline of 4–4.  The feud begins The rivalry between the clubs grew during the 1990s, as Dortmund's stature increased to challenge perennial title favourites Bayern, winning two Bundesliga titles in 1994–95 and 1995–96. In 1996, Bayern captain Lothar Matthäus accused Germany teammate Andreas Möller of being a 'crybaby', wiping imaginary tears from his face; Möller reacted by slapping Matthäus. At the end of that season, Dortmund won the 1997 UEFA Champions League final which happened to be played at the Olympiastadion, Bayern's home ground. The teams met in the quarter-finals of the next edition of the Champions League, and Dortmund prevailed over two legs thanks to a single goal from Stéphane Chapuisat. That summer, Bayern hired Dortmund's successful coach Ottmar Hitzfeld to work for them. Tempers flared twice during Bayern and Dortmund's second meeting in the 1998–99 Bundesliga, as Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn first attempted a flying kung-fu kick at Chapuisat, and later appeared to bite Heiko Herrlich's ear. In the early 2000s both clubs remained successful, as Bayern lost one Champions League final (1999) then won another (2001) in addition to more domestic success, while Dortmund won the 2001–02 Bundesliga and reached the UEFA Cup final the same year. An angry 2001 league meeting between the pair was notable for ten yellow cards and three red being shown (a Bundesliga record for indiscipline). However, Dortmund soon fell heavily into debt, and a €2m loan from Bayern in 2004 was a major reason for them being saved from bankruptcy. On 19 April 2008, the two sides clashed in the 2008 DFB-Pokal final for the first time that took place in Berlin. Luca Toni opened the scoring after eleven minutes, but Mladen Petric drew Dortmund level in stoppage time, forcing thirty additional minutes. The Italian completed his double in extra time, thus lifting Bayern to cup glory.  Dortmund revival By 2010, Dortmund had put together a strong squad, including Mats Hummels, Mario Götze, Shinji Kagawa and Robert Lewandowski, who led the club to the 2011 and 2012 Bundesliga titles; it was the first time any club other than Bayern won back-to-back championships since Dortmund in the mid-1990s. Dortmund clinched the 2011–12 league championship in a home match where bananas were tossed at Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Dortmund then claimed the first double of their history by beating Bayern 5–2 in the 2012 DFB-Pokal final with a Lewandowski hat-trick, which was also their fifth consecutive win over the opponents.  Champions League final at Wembley After seeing two league championships heading to Dortmund and losing the 2012 UEFA Champions League final to Chelsea at their own Allianz Arena, Bayern recovered to clinch the 2012–13 Bundesliga in record time, breaking Dortmund's points record which had been set the year before. At the end of that season, the rivals met in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final. The German clubs had eliminated the two Spanish contenders, Real Madrid and Barcelona, leading to the term "German Clasico" term first being used at that time, based on the El Clásico between those two Spanish clubs. The game was also notable for the fact that Dortmund's Mario Götze had already agreed to join Bayern in the coming weeks, although he did not play in the final due to injury. In the first all-German European final, Arjen Robben scored a dramatic 89th-minute winner at Wembley Stadium. Bayern would wrap up the first Treble in their history a week later in the 2013 DFB-Pokal final.  Domestic finals and player moves Following the biggest match involving the teams, several domestic finals were played between them in quick succession. In the 2014 DFB-Pokal final on 17 May 2014, Bayern managed to score two goals in extra time, thus achieving their 17th win in the competition. After that, both clubs met again in the 2014 DFL-Supercup at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park, featuring Robert Lewandowski who had just moved to Bayern as a free agent after his contract with Dortmund ended. The match ended 2–0 to Dortmund. Two years later, the 2016 DFB-Pokal final was the last match in Dortmund shirt for their captain Mats Hummels before he also moved to Bayern, where his career had begun; Bayern won the trophy on penalties after a 0–0 draw. They clashed again in the 2016 DFL-Supercup after Bayern secured a double, Dortmund being runners-up in the league as well as beaten cup finalists; the Bavarians won that match 2–0. The 2017 DFL-Supercup featured the same teams (champions Bayern and cup holders Dortmund) and the same outcome, this time Bayern winning on penalties after a 2–2 draw. In March 2018, Bayern secured a 6–0 home win over Dortmund in the league, the largest margin of victory for either side since the 11–1 result 47 years earlier. The most important recent result has seen Bayern Munich defeat Borussia Dortmund by a score of 3–1 in the 2021 DFL-Supercup.

Mohammad Helme bin Panjang (born 24 May 1983) is a Bruneian retired footballer and coach who played as a midfielder. He made four appearances for the Brunei national football team in 2001.  Club career Helme was one of the first players signed to DPMM FC, the club founded by Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah, even before the B-League was created. He exclusively played for DPMM throughout their four-year local stint, winning two B-League championships, one FA Cup and two Super Cups, and in addition becoming the B-League Young Player of the Year in 2002. He also briefly captained the side in the absence of Ali Momin before later relinquishing it to Rosmin Kamis. DPMM replaced the Brunei national representative team that competed in the Malaysian Premier League starting from the 2005–06 season. With former Brunei coach Ranko Buketa favouring the likes of Rosmin Kamis and Yussof Salleh over Helme, he found limited opportunities under the Croatian head coach, mostly appearing from the substitutes' bench. His side gained promotion and was even placed third in their top-flight debut, but Helme had minimal input. It was only when Yordan Stoykov took over in the 2007-08 season that Helme saw more game time. Ultimately, in a tumultuous period for DPMM which saw them move to the Singaporean league and then subject to a FIFA ban, Helme was not retained for the 2009 season, instead being replaced by namesake Helmi Zambin. After a few years away from the game, Helme joined Kasuka FC, a reformed team that were to compete in the Brunei Premier League in 2015. He gained promotion with Kasuka and played with them for another season in the Brunei Super League until transferring to Temburong-based side Lun Bawang FC in 2017.  International career Due to eye-catching performances for DPMM FC in local tournaments, Zainuddin Kassim drafted Helme into the national squad for the 2002 World Cup qualifying matches to be held in April–May 2001. Helme was in the starting lineup for four of the games, all ending in defeats. Helme also played for the Brunei under-20s at the 2002 AFC Youth Championship qualification matches in South Korea in March 2002, as well as Brunei under-21s at the 2005 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy.  Coaching career In 2022 Helme was appointed head coach of DPMM FC for the 2022 Brunei FA Cup, occupying the seat made vacant by Adrian Pennock. He coached DPMM all the way to the final of the competition on 4 December. His team were victorious against Kasuka FC in that final, bringing DPMM's second FA Cup triumph which Helme first won as a player in 2004. Helme was assigned to coach the DPMM FC under-20s playing in the Brunei Youth League U20 from 2023. He managed to take the youngsters to become the competition's champions in March 2024, while also winning the Best Coach of the League award.

Phantom of the Opera is a musical with lyrics and a book by Ken Hill. It is based on the 1910 novel The Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux. Hill wrote the original lyrics to the music of Giuseppe Verdi, Charles Gounod, Jacques Offenbach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Carl Maria von Weber, Gaetano Donizetti, and Arrigo Boito. It premiered in Lancaster, Lancashire, England, in 1976, and had a West End production in 1991. and further international productions  Synopsis Act I The story begins ("Introduction") with Richard, new manager of the Paris Opera House (previously president of Northern Railways and a member of the Stock Exchange Choir), greeted by the artists and staff ("Welcome Sir, I'm So Delighted"). The previous managers of the Paris Opera did not last very long, due to problems with the legend of the Opera Ghost, who demands 20,000 francs a month and his own private box. These requests are defied by the adamant and foolish Richard, little knowing the mayhem that will take place if he refuses to accept the Ghost's demands. Madame Giry, the box keeper, warns Richard that he may have upset the "Ghost". She is horrified when Richard demands use of Box Five (the Ghost's box). She knows the "Ghost" won't stand idly by while Richard refuses to accept his demands. She warns Richard to expect a run of horrific events. The evening performance begins ("Accursed All Base Pursuit of Earthly Pleasure"). The ghost provides his first warning in the form of the murder of Mephistopheles. After the performance, Richard's handsome (if somewhat dim) son Raoul, who is madly in love with the chorus girl Christine Daae, goes to her dressing room, only to hear her speak with another man. Jealous, Raoul enters the room to find it empty. This "ghost" seems very real, as is his love for Christine and woe betide anyone who gets in his way ("How Dare She"). A Groom comes to talk to Richard in his office about the disappearance of a horse named Caesar ("Late Last Night I'm In The Cellars"). Richard decides that the man is an idiot and promptly fires him. Raoul, feeling betrayed, meets with Christine at a local graveyard ("All Of My Dreams Faded Suddenly"). He is then introduced to the angelic voice of the Angel Of Music ("While Floating High Above"). Christine leaves and the Phantom attempts to throttle Raoul, but is disturbed by a Grave Digger, and runs off. Back at the Opera House, the unfortunate Richard has had to stand by while his son pursues the chorus girl Christine Daae, and now must convince his diva Carlotta, who feels she is too ill to perform, to sing at the performance later that evening, with the help of his staff ("She Says She's Got The Nodules"). An agreement is made that Christine Daae will sing the role, while Carlotta mimes the act. This wasn't what the Phantom had in mind. He'll not cease causing "accidents" and will do all in his power to disrupt the proceedings, including rubbing out the lead singer. At the evening performance, Carlotta mimes the act incorrectly and very clearly out-of-sync with Christine ("What Do I See"). Christine faints before the end of the performance and Carlotta starts to croak like a frog, causing her to call the performance to halt. Laughing madly, the Phantom declares to the whole stage that Carlotta is bringing down the chandelier. But then, he finds the chandelier is the wrong one and switches it to a candelabra, dropping it on Carlotta. After the performance, Christine and Raoul meet on the rooftop of the Opera House to discuss running away from the Opera House and the Phantom together. But the Phantom isn't very far away at all. He appears from behind the statue of Apollo and towers above them ("To Pain My Heart Selfishly Dooms Me"). Christine and Raoul leave the roof, leaving the Phantom alone. An old man enters, throwing bird-seed down for the pigeons on the Opera House's roof. The Phantom's hurt turns to anger, and he throws the unfortunate man off the building. He screams that Christine will be his and the first act ends.  Act II A performance of Faust begins with Christine singing the lead role of Marguerite ("Ah! Do I Hear My Lover's Voice?"). However, during the song there's an unscheduled blackout and when the lights come back up, Christine has disappeared. The show quickly adjourns and the rest of the cast search high and low for her all over the Opera House, taking their lanterns into the audience ("No Sign! I See No Sign!"). But to no avail. The scene switches to the Phantom's underground domain where he has kidnapped Christine in his boat and ties her to a post at his mist-shrouded dock before rowing slowly back into the darkness, leaving Christine behind ("Somewhere Above The Sun Shines Bright"). Meanwhile, the search party above ground migrates to the boiler room and the Persian reveals his true identity, and fills us in on the Phantom's history ("Born With A Monstrous Countenance"). Raoul searches for a way down to the cellars below the Opera House ("In The Shadows, Dim And Dreay"). He succeeds and slips through a manhole with the rest of the group, into a boiler room. However things quickly heat up, literally, as the Phantom traps them inside. It looks like the end for the motley group, and they break into a chorus of ("What An Awful Way To Perish"). The final scene takes place in the Phantom's Chapel, with his organ and its unkempt riot of sheet music as a center-piece. He seems determined to wed Christine and expresses his love for her ("Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain"). As the song ends, Christine tears off his mask and the Phantom screams in anger and shame, hiding his face from Christine. His sobs fade and he turns back, with a determined and violent look in his eyes, and produces a priest and chorus girl to bear witness to the forced marriage between him and Christine. But just in time, Raoul, the Persian and the rest of the group burst in, having escaped the Boiler Room and come through The Phantom's traps. The Phantom, suddenly finding himself in a tight spot, produces a knife and pulls Christine in front of him. In act of love to Christine, the Phantom stabs himself with his own dagger and dies in Christine's arms ("Ne'er Forsake me, Here Remain"). Christine remarks that the Phantom was always the angel of music ("He Will Not Go Without A Friend").  Characters Jammes Richard Rémy Debienne Raoul Mephistopheles Faust Madam Giry Christine Daaé La Carlotta The Phantom The Groom Lisette The Persian Dominque  Musical numbers "All of My Dreams Faded Suddenly", sung by the character Christine, was added to the show in 1992 for the first Japanese tour, based upon an aria by Antonín Dvořák. It replaced "Love Has Flown, Never Returning", but not before the latter had been recorded onto the West End cast recording of Phantom of the Opera. The newer song has never been recorded and released.  Productions Original version As Ken Hill rummaged through a used bookstore, he picked up a copy of The Phantom of the Opera and eventually produced it as a stage musical. The show started off as a production at Morecambe Pier as the first staged musical version, and then when Hill was working as Director of Productions for the Newcastle Playhouse. This first production was produced at The Duke’s Playhouse in Lancaster on 26 July 1976, where it proved to be a hit. It was directed by John Blackmore, designed by Clare Lyth, with musical direction by Gary Yershon. It differed from the later version of Ken Hill’s musical, in having a modern musical score by Ian Armit (who also worked with Hill on his musical The Curse of the Werewolf) in addition to excerpts from the opera Faust by Charles Gounod.  1984 version and aborted collaboration with Lloyd Webber In 1984, Hill revived his musical version of The Phantom of the Opera. This time though, he wanted to add the kind of music that would have been heard at the Opéra Garnier in the late 19th century. Consequently, he discarded Armit's score and wrote original English lyrics, that told Leroux’s tale, set to opera arias by Verdi, Gounod, Offenbach, Mozart, Weber, Donizetti, and Boito. This score better reflected the atmosphere of the era in which the novel was written. This updated version was produced jointly by the Newcastle Playhouse and the Theatre Royal Stratford East, and premiered at the Newcastle Playhouse on 3 April 1984, and soon moved to the Theatre Royal Stratford East. In between, the show had two brief runs at the New Tyne Theatre in Newcastle and the Grand Theatre in Wolverhampton; neither of those productions did very well. When the show got the Theatre Royal Stratford East, Sarah Brightman, who would create the role of Christine in the Lloyd Webber version, was asked to perform the role of Christine in the 1984 cast but she turned it down, leaving the role for the opera singer Christina Collier. Andrew Lloyd Webber, who at the time was married to Brightman, and Cameron Mackintosh attended a performance of Hill’s Phantom at the Theatre Royal Stratford East. Prompted by the good reviews, they approached Hill about the possibility of their collaborating on developing a grand scale version of his adaptation in the West End and offered to produce it. Hill and Lloyd Webber had worked together earlier on a revival of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat at the Winchester Theatre. Lloyd Webber and Mackintosh had been enthusiastic when they broached the idea to Hill about his Phantom of the Opera. But in the end, Lloyd Webber chose to pursue the musical without Hill, and developed  his own version.  Subsequent productions Hill's Phantom of the Opera premiered in America in 1987 at the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis. This production starred Sal Mistretta as The Phantom; his performance won him the St. Louis Theatre Critics Award. A second US production was mounted in 1988 in San Francisco at the Theatre in the Square, produced by Jonathan Reinis. The productions in St. Louis and San Francisco were so successful that Hill was asked to mount a national tour of the United States. Jonathan Reinis (who later produced Ken Hill’s The Invisible Man in London) formed the Phantom Touring Company, which acted as the producer for the tour, along with Electric Factory Concerts. The tour began in 1989, with musical arrangements and designs by the original Newcastle Playhouse team. It played for a few years to packed houses all over America, travelling to approximately 110 cities, and grossing a total of $72 million. In 1991, Phantom of the Opera returned to the United Kingdom, where it embarked on a national tour produced by Stewart Macpherson and then transferred to London’s West End. It opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre on 18 December 1991 with a similar cast to the 1984 production: Peter Straker was The Phantom, with Christina Collier as Christine. But despite positive reviews, the West End production did poorly at the box office at the time of IRA bombings, and closed earlier than expected on 11 April 1992. However, the production was nominated for two Olivier Awards for Best New Musical and Best Director of a Musical. Since 1992, Phantom of the Opera has been performed around the world, in countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Italy, Germany, Japan and Korea. The 2013 production in Tokyo, Japan, running from 19 to 29 December 2013 was produced by Stewart Macpherson, who originally produced the West End production in 1991.  Other Tokyo productions included one in 2018. Another Tokyo production is set for January 2024, starring Ben Forster as The Phantom and Paul Potts as Faust.  Recording The official cast recording of the show was released in 1993 by D Sharp Records. It featured the entire West End cast. It was later released by two other record labels: Stetson Records (an offshoot of The Stetson Group), and BMG. The latter versions of the CD were mainly sold in Japan (in Japanese packaging), Australia and New Zealand, on national tours.   == References ==

Alessandro Piazza (20 July 1915 – 16 September 1995) was an Italian biblical scholar and the Bishop of Albenga.  Biography Alessandro Piazza was born on 20 July 1915 in Genoa. He studied at the Minor Archdiocesan Seminary and later at the Major Archdiocesan Seminary of his hometown. On 11 July 1938, at the age of 22, he was ordained a priest in the Cathedral of Saint Lawrence in Genoa. The Archbishop of Genoa, Pietro Cardinal Boetto, sent him to continue his studies in sacred scripture and theology at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome. There, he received the licentiate degree and was assigned as a teacher of Hebrew and Scripture at the Archdiocesan Major Seminary. On 18 May 1965 he was appointed the Bishop of Albenga and consecrated in the Genoa Cathedral on 24 June. The principal consecrator was Giuseppe Cardinal Siri. As Bishop, he oversaw the complete restoration of the Cathedral of Saint Michael of Albenga, restoring it to its original Romanesque style. He also founded the Institute for Religious Sciences in the diocese and favored the cultural reinvigoration of the clergy and laity in light of the Second Vatican Council, of which he was a member and participant in its last session. As a biblical scholar, he served as the secretary of the episcopal committee and as a member of the editorial board of Bible of CEI, the official Italian translation of the Bible for liturgical use published in 1971. Along with biblical scholar Enrico Galbiati, he wrote the book Difficult Pages of the Old Testament (Italian: Pagine difficili della Antico Testamento), of which many Italian editions were released and translations into English, Spanish, Polish, and Russian were made. On 1 December 1973, the Diocese of Albenga, which was established in the fifth century, changed its name without changing its structure, taking the name of Diocese of Albenga-Imperia, to better reflect the presence of the capital of Liguria that had always been a part of its territory. With the change in name of the diocese, Piazza's title was changed to Bishop of Albenga-Imperia. On 6 October 1990, Pope John Paul II accepted his resignation from pastoral governance of the diocese due to age and appointed Mario Meini as his successor. Piazza retired to the Episcopal Seminary of Albenga, from where he collaborated with his successor until his death on 16 September 1995. Piazza was buried in the right nave beneath the altar of the Blessed Sacrament in the Albenga Cathedral.  References External links Galbiati and A.

Blackfoot Crossing Historical Park is a complex of historic sites on the Siksika 146 Indian reserve in Alberta, Canada.  This crossing of the Bow River was traditionally a bison-hunting and gathering place for the Siksika people and their allies in the Blackfoot Confederacy. The nearest towns are Cluny and Gleichen, in Wheatland County.  Treaty 7 The crossing became an important place in Canadian history when Treaty 7 was signed here between the native nations of what is now southern Alberta and the Canadian government on behalf of the Crown in 1877.  It was also here that Crowfoot, chief of the Siksika, is believed to have died and been buried.  As well, Poundmaker, a Cree chief who had been ceremonially adopted by Crowfoot to create peace between the Blackfoot and the Cree, was also buried here until being moved in 1967.  In 1925 the traditional gathering site and the treaty signing site were declared National Historic Sites of Canada by the federal government's Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.  In 1972, the earthlodge village was also declared a national historic site. In 1977, Prince Charles visited the site to help commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the treaty.  After the success of this event the Siksika council wanted to build the site into a historical and tourist attraction and began fundraising and planning.  In 2007 the historical park opened, which includes an interpretive centre; monuments to Poundmaker, Crowfoot, and Treaty 7; tipi remains; hiking trails; and the earthlodge village site.  Earthlodge village Nearby are the remains of an ancient earthlodge village, believed to have been built by people from the Upper Mississippi valley in what is now the United States.  It is unique in being an example of a permanent village on the plains: an area associated with nomadic hunting.  The earthlodge village is the only known one of its type on the Canadian Prairies, though they are common in parts of the United States.  The creators of the earthlodge village are not known with certainty, but archaeological evidence points to it being founded around 1740 CE, possibly by a band of migrating Mandan people or their allies the Hidatsa (possibly before the Hidatsa and Crow people split).

Sir Algernon Edward West  (4 April 1832 – 21 March 1921) was an English civil servant. He acted as Principal Private Secretary to Prime Minister William Gladstone.  Biography He was the third son of Martin John West and Lady Maria Walpole, third daughter of Horatio Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford; Edward West was his uncle. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1850. He left after two terms, becoming a clerk in the Inland Revenue, and then transferring to the Admiralty. West was Private Secretary to Gladstone between 1861 and 1894. He was a Progressive Party Alderman of London County Council from 1898 to 1907. He held the office of Justice of the Peace (JP) for Middlesex. He held the office of Chairman of the Board of the Inland Revenue. He was invested as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 30 July 1886. He was promoted to a Knight Grand Cross of the order (GCB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and was invested by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902. He was later invested as a Privy Counsellor (PC). From 1880, West lived at the manor at Wanborough, Surrey.  West entertained many political figures at the manor including Gladstone, Queen Victoria and Bismarck. West was also a director of the South Eastern Railway and he caused a new station, named Wanborough but actually at Normandy, to be opened in 1891.  In 1900, Wanborough Manor was passed on to H. H. Asquith until he became Prime Minister.  In 1908, West returned to stay in the manor until his death in 1921.  Family West married Mary Elizabeth Caroline Barrington, daughter of Hon. George Barrington and Lady Caroline Grey (daughter of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey), on 12 August 1858. Three sons and a daughter survived him.

Air Vice-Marshal George John William Mackinolty, OBE (24 March 1895 – 24 February 1951) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Commencing his service in the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) as a mechanic during World War I, he rose to become the RAAF's chief logistics officer for more than twenty years. Mackinolty was born in Victoria and joined the AFC in 1914.  He first saw active duty the following year in the Middle East with No. 30 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (formerly the Mesopotamian Half Flight). In 1916 he was mentioned in despatches and posted to No. 2 Squadron AFC. By the end of the war he had been commissioned a second lieutenant. Joining the newly formed RAAF in August 1921, Mackinolty established himself as the service's senior logistician between the wars, first as Director of Transport and Equipment from 1929 to 1935, and thereafter as Director of Equipment. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1937. Soon after the outbreak of World War II, he became Director of Supply and was promoted to group captain. In June 1942 he was raised to acting air commodore and appointed the Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE). Promoted to air vice-marshal in 1948, Mackinolty continued to serve as AMSE until his sudden death from cancer in February 1951, aged fifty-five.  Early life and World War I Born on 24 March 1895 at Leongatha, Victoria, Mackinolty was the son of labourer James Mickleburg Mackinolty and his wife Mary. He went to public schools, obtaining his merit certificate before undertaking formal engineering and business courses in Melbourne. Commencing his working life as a coach and motor-body builder, he enlisted in the Australian Military Forces on 17 August 1914, soon after the outbreak of World War I. His experience in the motor industry led to assignment as an air mechanic with the Aviation Instructional Staff at Central Flying School (CFS), Point Cook. He was soon promoted from private to corporal and later, having gained a reputation for his skill with timber, raised to sergeant and given command of the school's woodworking team.  On 1 August 1915, Mackinolty transferred to the Australian Imperial Force, to lead a team of thirteen other mechanics as reinforcements for an Australian Flying Corps contingent serving in the Mesopotamian campaign. He departed Melbourne nine days later aboard RMS Persia, and arrived at Basra on 1 September. Mackinolty's team immediately joined No. 30 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (originally the Mesopotamian Half Flight AFC), which moved into the city of Kut after its capture by British Empire troops in the Battle of Es Sinn.  The unit took part in the Battle of Ctesiphon in November, and organised supply drops to the British and Indian garrison in Kut during the siege that lasted from December 1915 until the following April. Mackinolty was promoted in the field to flight sergeant in June 1916, and mentioned in despatches on 19 October. When the Australian members of No. 30 Squadron were dispersed, he was posted to Kantara, Egypt, where he joined the newly established No. 2 Squadron AFC (also numbered No. 68 Squadron RFC by the British). Commanded by Major Oswald Watt, the unit relocated to England in January 1917. Following his service with No. 2 Squadron, Mackinolty was assigned to No. 5 (Training) Squadron AFC, which formed at Shawbury, Shropshire, in June 1917. Praised for his organisational and leadership abilities, he was commissioned as an equipment officer in March 1918, with the rank of second lieutenant. The following month he was given command of an aircraft repair unit in Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, home of two squadrons of the AFC's 1st Training Wing.  Between the wars Mackinolty remained in England following the end of hostilities, serving as "officer in charge of Australian packing" at RAF Hendon, near London, from December 1919 to September 1920. In this role he was responsible for crating and shipping to Point Cook the 128 aircraft and associated spares, weaponry, vehicles, hangars and other equipment that made up Britain's post-war Imperial Gift of Royal Air Force surplus to Australia, which eventually filled 19,000 cases. Mackinolty also completed formal training in aeronautical engineering before returning to Melbourne in October 1920. Discharged from the AIF in January 1921, he worked in the automotive industry and took a correspondence course on internal combustion engines.  On 8 August 1921, Mackinolty was commissioned as a flying officer in the newly formed Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). A member of the Stores and Accounting Branch, he commenced service with No. 1 Aircraft Depot at Point Cook in December. He was assigned to the staff of RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in 1924. On 20 November that year, he married Eileen Moore at Christ Church, South Yarra; the couple had a son and a daughter. In 1925, Mackinolty was posted as Equipment Officer to No. 3 Squadron at the recently established RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales.  Promoted flight lieutenant, he was appointed Director of Transport and Equipment at RAAF Headquarters in 1929, effectively making him the Air Force's senior supply officer, a role he would occupy for the next twenty-two years. His continuous tenure in essentially the one post was comparable to the RAAF's other chief logistician, Squadron Leader (later Air Vice-Marshal) Ellis Wackett, who served as its senior engineer for twenty-four years, from 1935 to 1959. Mackinolty's position was redesignated Director of Equipment in April 1935. At around this time, he collaborated with Squadron Leader George Jones, then Director of Training, on an investigation into the state of aircraft production in Australia to highlight shortfalls in local defence in the face of possible future conflict with Japan.  Though the report was reviewed enthusiastically by the Air Member for Personnel, Wing Commander Bill Anderson, it apparently went no further in the chain of command and thus was effectively ignored. Raised to squadron leader, Mackinolty was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Coronation Honours on 11 May 1937, in recognition of his achievements in stores and accounting. In February the following year he was promoted to  wing commander. The punctilious Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Richard Williams, sometimes complained that Mackinolty did not pay enough attention to his personal appearance, but never failed to acknowledge his "professional excellence".  World War II and after In April 1940 Mackinolty became Director of Supply, reporting to the Director-General of Supply and Production on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body. Responsible for all stores and equipment, Mackinolty also represented his service at the Federal Contract Board, Department of Supply, and Oil Board. He was promoted to temporary group captain in June that year. With the formation in 1942 of Allied Air Forces Headquarters, which assumed the operational functions of the Chief of the Air Staff, the Air Board was reorganised. The offices of Air Member for Organisation and Equipment, once held by Air Marshal Richard Williams, and Director-General of Supply and Production, a civilian position, were dissolved and replaced by those of the Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) and Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance (AMEM) to focus on the two key logistical functions of supply and engineering, respectively. Promoted to acting air commodore, Mackinolty became the inaugural AMSE in June.  Air Commodore Ellis Wackett became AMEM at the same time. Norman Ashworth, in How Not to Run an Air Force!, observed that splitting the logistical functions of the Air Board in this manner appeared to be a "uniquely Australian" experiment, and it was not inconceivable that the organisation had been "tailored" to suit these "two very capable officers". Serving as AMSE for the remainder of the war, Mackinolty was credited with successfully managing the supply requirements of personnel and aircraft for an organisation that by 1945 had grown by a factor of fifty from its pre-war size, to become the world's fourth largest air force.  Following the end of hostilities, Mackinolty was personally responsible for disposing of surplus equipment up to an original value of £500, and jointly responsible (with the Business and Finance Members of the Air Board) for disposing of equipment valued between £500 and £10,000. His duties as AMSE extended to setting the peacetime meal rations for RAAF personnel. In May 1946, he joined the Australian Battlefields Memorial Committee, convened to advise the Federal government regarding commemoration of the armed forces for their wartime achievements. Later that year, Mackinolty visited British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) headquarters in Japan, and subsequently arranged for the RAAF to assume responsibility for the supply of spare parts to its air component, British Commonwealth Air Group (BCAIR).  He was raised to acting air vice-marshal in January 1947 (substantive in October 1948). By this time, Mackinolty and the Chief of the Air Staff, No. 4 Squadron AFC veteran Air Vice-Marshal George Jones, were the only remaining RAAF officers who had served in both world wars. Other senior commanders and veterans of the Australian Flying Corps had been summarily retired in 1946, a "purge" that was ostensibly designed to make way for the advancement of younger and equally proficient officers. During 1947, the RAAF prepared for the introduction of an apprentice engineering scheme. Against a harsh post-war economic climate, Mackinolty personally intervened to improve the planned accommodation for trainees, arguing that the youths could not be expected to live in the austere conditions to which other members of the Air Force were used. He further noted in his submission to the Minister for Air, Arthur Drakeford, that "the parents of apprentices will, from time to time, be permitted to visit their sons and it would be in the interest of both the Apprentice Scheme and the Service generally if all reasonable efforts were made to create a favourable impression in the minds of the parents". Shortly after the first intake of engineer apprentices in January 1948, Mackinolty formally proposed that a similar scheme be set up for apprenticeships in the supply and clerical trades. Although initially rejected by the Minister, after some refinements the plan came to fruition three years later as the Junior Equipment and Administrative Training Scheme. In January 1951, Mackinolty was struck down suddenly with cancer and admitted to hospital at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria. He died there on 24 February, survived by his wife and children.  At the time of his death, he had served for a decade as honorary treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmens' Imperial League of Australia, and was the last member of the original staff of the AFC in 1914 still serving. He was succeeded as AMSE by Air Vice-Marshal Joe Hewitt. Described by Air Force historian Alan Stephens as "the most significant logistics officer in the history of the RAAF", Mackinolty was accorded an Air Force funeral with full honours at Bathurst Memorial Chapel, Elsternwick, and cremated at Springvale Crematorium.

A COVID-19 outbreak in the city of Shanghai, China began on February 28, 2022, and ended on August 7, 2022. The outbreak was caused by the Omicron variant and became the most widespread in Shanghai since the pandemic began two years prior. Authorities responded with mass COVID-19 testing and a strict lockdown of the city in an effort to uphold China's zero-COVID policy; the latter marked the largest one in the country since the lockdown of Hubei in early 2020. The outbreak caused substantial economic and social disruption across Shanghai with consequences felt elsewhere, and led to the spread of COVID-19 to other parts of China, including Beijing, Guangdong, and Hunan.  Background The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019. It began in early 2020 as an outbreak in Hubei province, China, which prompted a strict lockdown. The Chinese government's response since then has been to pursue a zero-COVID strategy, aiming to eliminate the virus altogether. However, the increased transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant that emerged in late 2021 has posed challenges. Since 2020, nearly 40% of international arrivals to China came through Shanghai. Shanghai also had a relatively large number of imported cases. By March 14, the number of cases reported as coming from outside mainland China was 4345, compared to 473 local cases. Shanghai authorities had previously taken a "more relaxed" approach to the pandemic compared to other Chinese cities. Doctor Zhang Wenhong of the Shanghai Medical Treatment Expert Group, said the control of COVID-19 in Shanghai is like "catching a mouse in the ceramic shop", and said maintaining a normal manufacturing industry and public life is important. Due to the Omicron variant, Shanghai's COVID-19 response had been challenged.  Outbreak On February 28, a 56-year-old vaccinated woman came to Tongji Hospital with a fever and was confirmed positive on March 1. This case became patient zero in the outbreak. After confirmation of her case, her dance group had at least 8 people test positive as well. After confirming a positive diagnosis, the risk levels of some areas of Shanghai were raised from "low risk" to "middle risk". According to Shanghai's information office, the main source for the spread of the outbreak was the Huating Hotel, a previously designated quarantine site for inbound travelers. In response, the Shanghai World Expo Exhibition & Convention Center was converted into a temporary hospital on March 26, 2022. By March 27, just before Shanghai started area-separated testing, a total of 16,013 people had tested positive for COVID-19. Additional temporary quarantine centers in the Shanghai New International Expo Center opened on 29 March 2022. By April 8, there had been a total of 131,524 people tested positive, with a single severe case. About 90 percent of the cases were "asymptomatic". By April 17, according to China National Radio, Shanghai had 16 severe cases, all having pre-existing health conditions, with only 1 of them being vaccinated. On the same day, officials reported 3 deaths of COVID-19 infected patients, with all deaths also being linked to other underlying health conditions, such as diabetes. On April 18, officials reported 7 more deaths with ages ranging from 60 to 101; 6 of them were aged above 70. On April 22, officials announced they would escalate COVID lockdown restrictions and further tighten lockdown measures. Some of the new measures include evacuating people to disinfect their homes and placing electronic door alarms to warn if infected people are trying to leave. By April 30, officially all of the deaths were caused by other severe symptoms. On the same day, the first fangcang quarantine hospital (fang1cang1 方舱, literally "portable building") was officially closed.  Graphs Data source: National Health Commission of China  Government response to the outbreak Lockdown On 28 February 2022, introduction of travel restrictions was announced by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and negative PCR testing within 48 hours of the travel became mandatory. In addition to the negative PCR testing, travel from "control area" to "prevention area" was conditioned by the 14 days mandatory quarantine at its own residence (quarantine in commercial facilities such as hotel does not qualify) within the "prevention area". On 15 March, Civil Aviation Administration of China announced that the international flights into Shanghai shall be diverted to other cities. Shanghai decided to adopt "area-separated and batch-separated control" (Chinese: 分区分批防控) starting on March 28. On March 27, many markets got crowded, with some scholars arguing these conditions were due to city closure. This was extended on April 1. Some media suspected that cases were underreported. Wang Keyu, a staff member at Huashan Hospital stated that (locally-available) COVID-19 vaccines offered weak protection against the Omicron variant, and that a wide range of COVID-19 testing control was important and necessary. By March 29, over 9.1 million people had been tested by roughly 17,000 testers in roughly 6,300 testing areas. By April 1, over 18 million people had been tested. Since April 1, most areas of Shanghai are under three-level control. The levels includes "closed area" (封控区), "control area" (管控区), and "prevention area" (防控区) and typically spans the size of a residential complex, later (in June) granulizing into individual buildings. On April 5, the lockdown was expanded to encompass the entire city, affecting the population of 25 million. On April 11, Shanghai published the list of closed areas, control areas, and prevention areas.  On April 11, Shanghai officially announced all areas are under three-level control and clarified. Closed area contains people who tested positive for COVID-19 in the neighborhood, the "7-7" quarantine policy is required to follow, during 7-day closing period, if there was no people who tested positive, the restriction will be the same as the restrictions of a "control area". People in control areas can, with limit, collect essential supplies within the neighborhood. Neighborhoods which are listed as prevention areas have no reported case within 14 days. People in prevention areas should only travel within the street.  In practice, additional restrictions are levied by the local residents' committee. Since April 22, Shanghai officials said Shanghai have to follow the "static management" (静态管理) policy On April 27, Shanghai officials announced that some hospitals in Shanghai will temporarily suspend their service. On May 6, multiple areas (including "prevention areas") was put into a so-called "silent period" (静默期), banning all entry and exit, including delivery shipment. The stated rationale was that some positive cases appeared in prevention areas, and for a "final assault" (攻坚) on the case count. On May 17, another wave of "silencing" started, this time spanning the entirety of multiple districts, again under the name of a "final assault". On May 6, In Shanghai, which is entering its second month of lockdown, city officials said cases have been declining since Apr 22 and its outbreak is under control. From May 29, plans were announced to ease the lockdown on June 1. The adjustment entails:  People entering public areas and taking public transport must now show a negative PCR test result taken with 72 hours. The original requirement was 48 hours.  The standard for leaving the city remains unchanged: negative PCR test taken within 48 hours must be shown along with a negative antigen test within 24 hours. A ban on residents' committees adding additional restrictions in all areas except those marked "closed", "control", "mid-risk", and "high-risk". This has attracted criticism from these committees, who claimed that their extra restrictions were not their own decisions, but unwritten telephone orders from above. Lockdown measures on businesses are to be lifted as an effort to help the economy that has been hit hard with strict restrictions. The adjustments were made to "promote epidemic prevention and control as well as economic and social development, and resume work and a return to normal life," the city official added in the May 29 press conference. City officials also emphasized that the term "lifting the lockdown" (解封) is not to be used, as "static management" is not "lockdown" (封城). The lockdown was lifted at midnight June 1, with many rushing to the grocery store to restock on food. Shanghai declared that it would do its best to recover the losses caused by the epidemic. On June 3, four neighborhoods in Jing'an and Pudong were put back into "closed" lockdown and designated as "mid-risk" due to seven new cases found the prior day. On June 7, some more areas are restricted to "closed" area. In early July, many cases reported is related to a person who visited illegally operated KTV.  Mass testing and Isolation On March 4, Shanghai instituted a policy of mass COVID testing. In every building with a positive COVID-19 case, all residents were required to undertake individual "nucleic acid" COVID tests. Other areas undertook pooled COVID-19 testing. Shanghai residents were required to undertake nucleic acid tests throughout the lockdown, ranging from multiple times per week to once per day. Tests were initially posted on the Health Cloud APP, but over the course of the lockdown migrated to mini programs on Alipay or WeChat. Tests were required for all regions regardless of risk, and would generate a colored health code (jian4kang1 ma3 健康码). Each district was responsible for implementing their own system around the code Green codes were issued to people with negative antigen tests, yellow for close contacts of positive cases or those who did not test, and red for positive cases. Enforcement of health codes was left up to individual districts and communities; some locations forbade residents from leaving their neighborhoods regardless of the health code. Residents that refused COVID testing would see their health code turned red. Some neighborhoods threatened permanent red-code status for those who refused or resisted transportation to a quarantine center, with one location promising on April 12 that such people would "never be rehabilitated" (永不摘帽). Shanghai authorities converted schools, residential buildings and other structures into quarantine facilities when designated facilities ran short on space.  Education As the caseload in the outbreak was growing, there were messages like "Shanghai will stop school" on Weibo. On March 8, a Shanghai official denied the possibility, but for students absent due to COVID-19 the platform "Air Class" would allow for education to continue. On March 12, in-person school was suspended, with students able to participate using platforms such as "Shanghai V-Class" or "Shanghai Education" instead. On May 7, Official announced the National College Entrance Examination in Shanghai will be extended to June, Senior High School Entrance Examination in Shanghai will extend to July, with lab and English speaking test section being removed and counted as full credit toward final score. Shanghai Ministry of Education stated all middle and high school student could come to school before June 14.  Transportation On April 13, the Public Security Bureau of Shanghai announced that people in prevention areas must not enter "closing areas"; nonessential automobiles would also be prohibited.  Law enforcement On March 22, two people posted information on a group chat saying Shanghai was about to perform a "city closure"(feng1cheng2 封城). The next day, the public security bureau of Shanghai investigated both for the crime of posting false information intentionally. On March 26, Wu Fan, the vice-principal of Shanghai Medical College stated that Shanghai would not go into lockdown because of how much the city contributed to the economy of China. In general, Mainland China has strict laws controlling crime related to pandemic management. According to Chinese jurist Luo Xiang's Criminal Law Textbook, people who don't obey basic isolation rules when they know they have tested positive for COVID-19 have committed the crime of harming public safety (Chinese: 以危险方法危害公共安全罪). Other people who don't obey isolation rules but caused heavy losses may get accused of the crime of distraction of disease prevention (Chinese: 妨碍传染病防治罪). People who post allegedly false content about COVID-19 control policies may be accused of the crime of posting false information (Chinese: 编造、故意传播虚假信息罪). On April 18, the Public Security Bureau of Shanghai posted that the message "The women who gave preterm birth failed to ask for help and died because of hemorrhage" was false information. The women gave natural birth and were sent to a hospital on time and successfully gave birth. The publisher Zhang had been captured. There have been cases of fraud and illegal marketing during the Shanghai lockdown. On April 16, Ling, the legal representative of a medical company, sold 29,000 masks that did not meet health standards, and was arrested. On April 19, Tong sold rotten pork and was received 320,000 yuan out of that. Policies have been investing this case.  Impacts The outbreak and the strict response had significant economic impacts. Oil prices fell globally. By mid-April, the lockdown had led to Shanghai residents complaining of food shortages. On April 12, the United States ordered all nonessential workers at the Shanghai consulate to leave. During late March, Zhang Wenhong, a doctor who made many speeches during the pandemic, has been absent for a few events, some media suspect that this is a "sign" made by Shanghai government.  Popular culture depictions After the outbreak, artist Wang Yuanchao created the Shanghainese-language song "Steamed Eggs with Clams" (Chinese: 蛤蜊炖蛋), which described how people in Shanghai work together to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The song got considerable attention on the internet upon its publication. On March 27, the song "First Snap Up Groceries, Then Do Nucleic Acid" (Chinese: 先抢菜，再做核酸) was published on the WeChat Public Account; it got over 100,000 views in the first ten minutes after being published. Afterwards, the three authors renamed the song to "Buy Groceries" and uploaded it to NetEase Cloud Music, where it received more than 200,000 views. The song uses with humorous Shanghainese lyrics. A gala celebrating the Covid response was planned on April 12 but got cancelled after public outcry. An April 22 montage called The Sounds of April (四月之声) featured clips of government announcers and events such as pet-killing, child separation, and medical delays. The author also included some positive events like people sharing foods with in area and stated it was meant to be neutral. Many posts, including the original one, containing the montage were quickly taken down and netizens attempted to fight its removal on WeChat by various edits. Some users even tried to change their username on platforms like Weibo to protest. The original video had been played more than 5 million times before it was taken down. In late April to early May, online personality Dawn Wong produced Fake News with Alison Alison (爱丽森假新闻), an English-language, Chinese-subtitled satirical news show about lockdown conditions, from her residence in Shanghai. She posted two episodes to Weibo and YouTube, both being censored on the former. She was arrested on May 11 shortly after posting the second episode and was released after a two-hour "talk" resulting in the unlisting of these videos from YouTube.  Online protests Some content saw takedown by the authorities.  A rap song titled New Slave was uploaded to YouTube and saw some dissemination on WeChat timelines. A clip of the "Do You Hear the People Sing?" sequence from the 2012 film version of the musical Les Misérables circulated on Chinese social medias in protest of the lockdown. On April 28, some Shanghai residents self-organized an at-home protest on WeChat. They went to their balconies at night and banged pots in demand of food. The authorities quickly took the organizing posts down and claimed involvement of "foreign influences". On May 11, a group of epidemic prevention workers in white hazmat suits forced a citizen who was claimed to be a close contact to go to a quarantine facility due to CCP's Zero-COVID policy. The citizen told them that they had no right to force him to go to a quarantine facility because it was against the law. After a epidemic prevention worker threatened punishment all the way to his 3rd generation, the citizen responded, "We are the last generation, thank you!"A report from China Digital Times pointed out that this video was forwarded widespread online and commented on by netizens, expressing remonstrance towards the three-child policy. The original video was taken down on the same day.  Controversies Non-COVID medical delay and deaths The lockdown has caused a number of deaths due to an inability to receive appropriate medical care as COVID testing is required to access any emergency services and any hospital that has seen to a positive patient needed to undergo disinfection. High-profile individuals who died include a former Fudan University professor Yu Huizhong, a Dongfang Hospital nurse Zhou Shengni, and violinist Chun Shunping. On April 14, an article on WeChat listed 12 deaths due to lockdown practices, but was deleted soon after. A crowd-sourced continuation of the effort on Airtable listed 186 deaths as of April 30. Shanghai violinist Chen Shunping experienced a severe stomach ache and vomiting at night on April 13. Upon calling emergency services, he was told he would have to "wait in line". Later that night, he went to two different hospitals and was unable to receive medical service at either. Faced with immense pain, he committed suicide by jumping off a building. A 58-year-old male was found dead at home on May 1, with rumors of death by starvation. The city fact-checking service interviewed paramedics and confirmed that the actual cause was cardiac arrest. The community also said that they took good care of the man prior to his death, knowing that he was not in good health, having regularly delivered food during the pandemic.  Suicides On March 26, an old man is seen having died after falling off a residential building. The original poster suggested that the death was due to lack of access to medical help, but the family clarified that the dead has been allowed to regularly go to the hospital to the government-run fact checker. On April 3, a Shanghai woman wanted to send her grandfather meals, but the distance between their homes was very far. She found a man to deliver the meals for her to Qingpu but did not ask for money. The next day, the woman transferred him 200 yuan by phone but was later criticized for paying too little when she shared her story online. On April 6, she committed suicide. Her parents and other online commentators called for the people who bullied her to be sued or punished. On April 12, Hongkou District Health Department IT lead Qian Wenxiong killed himself, leaving behind his cancer-ridden wife. Many Chinese netizens believe his suicide was due to the stress under the zero-COVID policy. (Previous rumors inaccurately attributed the death either to Qian's wife or to another official named Cai Yongqiang and were "dispelled" by official sources.) On April 26, a French citizen is seen on a two-minute-long video asking quarantine workers for help with suicide in three languages. He was subdued and later became stabilized. The French embassy confirmed his identity and commented that food shortage is likely not the reason.  Pet killing On April 6, a community guard beat a Corgi to death after refusing a request to allow the dog to be taken with the owner into isolation. Later, the local community stated that they were worried that the dog may have been infected but acknowledged that they didn't "think very carefully" and would compensate the owner. On April 7, the infected owner of a cat called the CDC about bringing their cat to quarantine. The CDC bluntly responded that the "only thing they could do was to wait to be taken away and to give up on their cat".  On May 9, live fish were recorded getting killed by ground impact at the entrance to a residential complex in Jingan. The local residents' committee explained that the group-buy organizer acquired permission for buying refrigerated fish, not the prohibited live fish actually delivered. The organizer chose to kill the fish outside the gate to comply.  Forced quarantine According to a 19-minute recording, a woman and her husband were forced to go to a mobile cabin hospital, even though none of their family members were positive for COVID-19. They consented to leaving if tested positive, but policies had forced them to leave home because officials already believed they were positive for COVID-19. Shanghai officials replied saying that person in question was a 13-year-old girl, and they had already communicated with the family many times previously. and they had agreed at first, but this time they disagreed; according to the policy, they need to take them to a mobile cabin hospital. Officials also said that the results from the "Health Cloud" app may differ from the actual situation.  Child separation A system for quarantining children, including infants, away from adults was implemented. The site in Jinshan was first reported online by desperate parents. The separation was described officially on April 2 as a policy to "quickly help" minors and involves "temporary guardians". On April 4, the health committee said that a system is in place to allow some children to be accompanied by their also COVID-positive parents. An online trend started where parents sought to become infected to stay with their children. This system was described as a "humanitarian crisis" by a Radio France Internationale commentator. On March 31, the Consulate of France in Shanghai issued a protest to the Shanghai Government on behalf of 24 EU states.  Legality In early May, constitutional academic Tong Zhiwei expressed his opposition to forced quarantine transport and home disinfection, stating that the authorities' legal basis (Public Security Penalties Law, Art. 50(1)) is nil – the law requires a state of emergency to be declared, but none has been. Around the same time, financial lawyer Liu Dali expressed his opposition to procedural problems in quarantine transport, namely lack of paperwork and an overly liberal definition of "contact" involving whole floors or even buildings. Both articles were quickly taken down on the Chinese internet, their Weibo accounts suspended, and bar associations warned not to distribute these articles.

Conium ( or ) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. As of December 2020, Plants of the World Online accepts six species. All species of the genus are poisonous to humans. C. maculatum, also known as hemlock, is infamous for being highly poisonous. Hemlock is native to temperate regions of Europe, North Africa and Western Asia. The species C. chaerophylloides, C. fontanum, and C. sphaerocarpum are all native to southern Africa.  Description Plants of the genus Conium are eudicots, flowering plants distinguished by their two cotyledons (embryonic leaves) and tricolpate (three-pored) pollen. They are typically biennial, forming basal rosettes in the first year of growth, and sprouting a rigid, hollow flower stalk in the second. Germination occurs between spring and autumn. Occasionally, plants which germinate in early spring are annual instead of biennial. These plants grow best in wet, poorly drained areas with nutrient rich soil. They grow well in nitrogen rich soil, and are able to tolerate high levels of heavy metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, and lead. Conium plants are diploid, with a chromosome number of 2n = 22 (haploid number 11). They grow from one to three meters tall, varying between species. They produce hermaphroditic flowers, which are typically insect pollinated or self-fertilized.  Stems Conium plants are herbaceous, growing non-woody, hollow, and hairless stems. Generally, the stem is striated and light green; however, the coloring varies by species and variety. Some express purple blotching throughout, some have purple blotching localized near the base, and others have no markings at all.  Leaves The alternate leaves are pinnately compound and finely divided, with the exact pinnation patterns varying between species and leaf type. For example, stem leaves of C. maculatum plants are typically 2-4 pinnate, but basal leaves are 1-3 pinnate. The leaves and petioles are light green. Similar to the stem coloring, some species and varieties express purple blotching on the leaves and petioles.  Flowers Terminal inflorescences are made up of many small flowers, colored white, yellow, or green depending on the species. The flowers are grouped together in umbrella shaped umbels. Plants in the genus Conium have compound umbels, with multiple dome shaped clusters branching out from a central point. Flowers are around 2 mm across, and the umbrella shaped umbels range from 1–8 cm in diameter.  Fruits The two seeded fruit is one of the most significant distinguishing factors between species. They are relatively round, slightly flattened, and dark green or brown. Depending on the species, they range from 2.5 to 4 mm long. Some species have distinctive light brown ribs, some have ribs that are noticeably crenulate (scalloped edges), and others show relatively unpronounced rib patterns.  Seeds Each plant typically produces between 1,700 and 39,000 seeds, and 40-85% will germinate in suitable conditions. However, seeds will remain viable for 3 to 6 years after dispersal. Producing a large number of seeds, and growing in a variety of locations, these plants can be considered invasive in some cases.  Chemical composition Poisonous alkaloid compounds are present in all tissues of Conium plants. As a flower develops into a fruit and matures, the alkaloids present transform from γ-coniceine, to coniine, and finally to N-methylconiine. When ingested, these compounds interrupt the central nervous system, paralyzing respiratory muscles, and finally resulting in death through respiratory failure.  Species differentiation from other plants Members of the genus Conium can be easily confused with edible plants of the family Apiaceae. Conium plants have leaves similar to parsley (Petroselinum crispum) and roots similar to parsnip (Pastinaca sativa). However, a few characteristics can be used to distinguish the poisonous Conium plants from other harmless Apiaceae plants. For example, Conium leaves and stems release a foul odor when crushed. Additionally, the species C. maculatum stands out with its purple blotching pattern.  Taxonomy The genus name "Conium" references the Greek word koneios for 'spin' or 'whirl', alluding to the dizzying effects of the plant's poison after ingestion. In the vernacular, "hemlock" most commonly refers to the species C. maculatum, but it also refers to Cicuta species (water hemlock), where both species are similar in physical features, and both are highly toxic. The genus Conium was erected by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. Several botanists, such as J.F.M. Cannon, G.H. Leute, and J.H. Ross, have historically made the argument that southern African species of Conium has few significant distinctions. Some even claim that the genus has no independent species at all. They argue that the populations in southern Africa "may be the result of the chance introduction of a few individuals which represented genetically a very limited range of the total variability of the species." Some believe that each species of Conium is synonymous to C. maculatum. Others believe that there are two to three distinct southern African species of Conium.  History Conium was known to ancient Greeks, who used it for its narcotic properties and in capital punishment. It was used for the execution, among others, of Socrates and Theramenes. Conium maculatum, also known as poison hemlock, was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 publication, Species Plantarum. It was the first described species within the genus. "Maculatum" means spotted, referencing the purple blotches characteristic of this species. Conium chaerophylloides was described by Danish plant collector Christian Friedrich Ecklon (1795–1868) and German botanist Karl Ludwig Philipp Zeyher. In 1828, they came together in South Africa, forming a partnership. For the next decade, they built their collection, describing almost 2000 genera and species. Both C. fontanum and C. sphaerocarpum were described by South African botanist Olive Mary Hilliard and English botanist Brian Laurence Burtt. Together, they published their classifications in the South African Journal of Botany in 1985.  Species As of December 2020, Plants of the World Online accepts six species:  Conium chaerophylloides (Thunb.) Eckl. & Zeyh. Conium divaricatum Boiss. & Orph. Conium fontanum Hilliard & B.L.Burtt Conium hilliburttorum Magee & V.R.Clark Conium maculatum L. Conium sphaerocarpum Hilliard & B.L.Burtt  Conium chaerophylloides Conium chaerophylloides, growing two to three meters tall, can be distinguished by its unique yellow-green flowers. Groups of many of these small flowers make up obconical umbels. The outer rays (individual flowers) form an angle with the point of attachment, giving the umbel a cone-like shape, which fans out from the base of the inflorescence. They produce round, 4 mm long, dark brown or green fruit, with deep, lightly colored ridges.  Conium fontanum Conium fontanum expresses a similar obconical umbel arrangement, but produces slightly larger fruit, and develops the white flowers characteristic of the other species in the Conium genus. The fruit is usually larger than 4 mm long, with ridges of the same dark green or brown color as the rest of the ovary. These plants grow one to three meters tall, depending on the variety.  Conium hilliburttorum Conium hilliburttorum has not always been recognized as a distinct species within the genus. Like C. sphaerocarpum, these plants have white flowers grouped in hemispherical umbels and small fruit. However, these researchers argue that the fruit and ovary anatomy significantly distinguish them from C. sphaerocarpum. They develop similar sized fruit; however, C. hilliburttorum fruit displays prominent ribs, whereas C. sphaerocarpum fruit is relatively smooth. C. hilliburttorum ovaries are covered in tubercules, or small lumpy outgrowths, like C. chaerophylloides fruit. However, C. chaerophylloides plants have yellow or green flowers, and they grow much larger fruit and are much taller.  Conium maculatum Conium maculatum is distinguished by red or purple blotching along the hairless green stem. Some varieties of the southern African species express a moderate degree of blotching at the base of the stem, but most are simply green. It grows white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters.  Conium sphaerocarpum Conium sphaerocarpum produces similarly colored, but slightly smaller fruit, less than 3.5 mm long. The ovary is relatively smooth, with almost completely flat, inconspicuous ridges. Additionally, the small white flowers are arranged in hemispherical umbels. Each umbel's outer rays protrude horizontally, forming a semi-sphere shape, with the flat edge at the base of the umbel, and the dome pointing away from the point of attachment. This species tends to grow shorter than others within the genus.  Evolution Conium is a genus within the family Apiaceae. The family Apiaceae originates from Australasia in the Late Cretaceous period. Conium is specifically part of the Apioideae subfamily which split off from the other subfamilies of Apiaceae between 45.9 and 71.2 million years ago in southern Africa.  Toxin development The evolution of toxicity within Conium plants and within Apiaceae plants has several theories. Apiaceae plants contain secondary compounds which are compounds that are often limited to just a family, genus, or a species of plant that varies among those smaller groups and is unlikely to be essential to the day-to-day physiological needs of the plant. These secondary compounds are used to mediate the plants interactions with other organisms, such as the prevention of herbivory. Gottfried S. Fraenkel in 1959 called the distribution of secondary compounds within Apiaceae and other families reciprocal adaptive evolution. Ehrlich and Raven in 1964 called Fraenkel's process coevolution. They claimed that secondary compounds diversify by emerging as a novel compound that protects a plant from herbivory. Due to this protection from herbivory and mutation or recombination in an insect, the plant can become susceptible to herbivory once more if an insect evolves the means to detoxify or tolerate the toxin created by the secondary compound. With this new trait, the insect has a new adaptive zone with which it can diversify and the plant has a certain set of adapted herbivores. This is seen with Conium, where C. maculatum has an adaptive herbivore, Agonopterix alstromeriana.  Distribution Conium maculatum is native to northern Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. C. chaerophylloides, C. fontanum, and C. sphaerocarpum are all native to southern Africa. Conium maculatum has been introduced to the Americas, southern Africa, China, New Zealand, and Australia. It was originally brought to the United States from Europe as a garden plant. C. maculatum has been introduced to other parts of the world due to the transportation of grain. In many areas which C. maculatum has been introduced, it has become an invasive species.  Ecology All species of Conium are poisonous to humans and several other species of mammals; yet, some serve as food sources for some insects. In addition, the invasiveness of Conium species into non-native habitats is documented. It is unknown what the spread of Conium into new environments is primarily driven by.  Dispersal Seeds of the Conium plants fall close to the parent and primarily rely on abiotic and biotic vector transmissions for dispersal. For biotic transmissions, rodents and birds have been documented to spread seeds, with them clinging to the animals' fur. Human introductions of the plants from their native into new habitats (either accidentally through seed contamination or intentional as a garden plant or medicinal herb) is also a proposed cause of the plant being invasive in several regions, but these are not common.  Ecological relationships As a weed, Conium plants can spread into grasslands and other areas with low vegetation and crowd out local grass species. The plants spread very quickly and are very competitive with native grasses. Conium plants use their toxicity as a way to mediate their ecological interactions with other species. Despite the Conium plants being poisonous, several invertebrates and some insects have evolved mechanisms for avoiding toxicity of chemicals when feeding on the plants. One species of moth, Agonopterix alstroemeriana, infests C. maculatum. The plants serve as a host for several viruses, bacteria, and insects, including the carrot rust fly, Psila rosae; the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa; carrot thin leaf virus; celery mosaic virus; and alfalfa mosaic virus. In 2015, a novel Poison Hemlock Virus Y (PHVY) was isolated from leaf samples of C. maculatum with mild mosaic and vein yellowing symptoms, collected from fields in south-east Iran. The virus was shown serologically to be related to potyviruses.  Economic impact Conium plants are poisonous to a variety of animals including cows, sheep, goats, swine, rabbits, elk, poultry, and humans. Some of the impacts of the consumption of these plants on animals include muscle spasms, diarrhea, depression, skeletal malformations, and death. In fact, the most important losses from Conium plants is through livestock toxicity. An estimated yearly loss of livestock to these plants in the western US was $340 million. Although they are mostly found in non-crop fields, Conium plants compete with commercial agricultural plants, including several types of vegetables and grains. It has been found growing in corn, chickpea, vegetable, and orchard fields. Regions affected include Oceania, the Iberian peninsula, central Europe, and the United States. Economic losses of crops due to Conium invasion is not as widespread or severe as its affecting of animals farms, and there is little crop loss data available from those regions.  Uses Historically, the leaves and flowers of Conium plant species were prized for their decorative appearance, and they were bred and kept as ornamental decorative plants. Conium plants were also used as natural barriers and in medicine as treatments. As knowledge that chemicals produced by Conium plants were toxic to humans and mammals became widespread, their usage as decorative plants and as treatments have declined. Today, species of the Conium genus have no known uses, and they are classified as a weed. However, notably, C. maculatum continues to be used in medicine as an ingredient. In addition, the production of toxic chemicals that have limited their widespread public use has instigated research in the chemicals' potential applications in agriculture.  Pesticides Chemicals produced by and isolated from plants of this genus were found to have anti-insect and anti-predator properties and have been studied for use in agriculture. Coniine was proven to be effective against aphids and blowflies. In addition, extracts of Conium plants were found to inhibit Fusarium pallidoroseum, a fungal disease causing twig blight in mulberry. However, these findings have not yet been implemented in practice.  In medicine Extracts of Conium plants were used as sedatives and antispasmodics. Because of the plants' toxicities, uses as a medicine were discontinued by the early 20th century. Today, there are no accepted uses for the Conium genus plants as a treatment. Despite severe safety concerns and a lack of supporting scientific evidence, C. maculatum has continued to be used as homeopathy or home remedy treatment for several medical conditions including anxiety, muscle spasms, bronchitis, whooping cough, asthma, and arthritis. There is little information on the plant's interactions with other drugs and on treatment doses.  Other uses Conium maculatum was introduced into North America as an ornamental plant, imported into the United States and southern Canada. Plant hobbyists continue to cultivate this plant species today. As plants of the Conium species are known to be dangerous to mammals, they are also used as natural fences between tracts of land to block predatory animals such as wolves. It is grown along streams or rivers and near fences and pastures.  Toxicity All species of Conium are highly toxic to humans, many other mammals, and birds (in larger doses). Virtually all parts of the plant are poisonous to humans, and consumption of any part of the plant can cause poisoning. In most cases, poisoning occurs from a misidentification of the plant as an edible species, such as C. maculatum root with wild parsnips or its leaves with parsley.  Effects on humans and other animals Conium maculatum is especially known to be dangerous to pregnant and breast-feeding females and in children, where poisoning has occurred by consuming small amounts of C. maculatum. An overdose of Conium maculatum can typically produce paralysis, with a toxic dose causing loss of speech followed by inhibited respiratory function and, later, death. This plant species and others in the Conium genus are also toxic in larger mammals, including bovine, equestrian, and other domestic animals. They are also known to cause birth defects in domesticated animals. Birds do not appear to be affected as severely when consuming these seeds of these plants, but they can also be poisoned in larger doses.  Pharmacology In hemlock, eight piperidine alkaloids, known to cause strong physiological effects, were isolated. Two of the eight compounds, g-coniceine and coniine, were measured as having the highest concentration, and they contribute to the plant's toxicity. Other alkaloids that have been identified in hemlock include methyl coniine, ethyl piperidine and pseudoconhydrine. In larger animals, acute toxicity doses for C. maculatum are lower for pigs compared to cattle, and for sheep compared to goats. Specifically, toxicity doses are 3.3 mg/kg for cattle, 15.5 mg/kg for horses and 44.0 mg/kg for sheep.  Treatment Gastric lavage is performed on larger animals who have consumed Conium plants. For animals who have started to show symptoms, support respiration and treatment with activated charcoal and a saline cathartic are used. Support respiration and activated charcoal treatment is also given to human patients who have ingested Conium plants.  As a poison The Greek philosopher Socrates famously died by goading a jury into sentencing him to death by hemlock (see Plato's Apology.) Conium maculatum (poison hemlock) is infamous in its use as a poison. A small overdose of extract of the plant causes paralysis with higher toxic doses causing a ceasing of respiratory function followed by death. Poison hemlock was historically used in official executions and assassinations.  Cultivation Historically, Conium species has been grown as ornamental plants. As it has attractive flowers to some plant breeders, it was introduced to the US from Europe as a garden plant. However, there have been documented cases where there was an improper cultivation of plants, where the species, notably C. maculatum, is mistaken with common edible plants such as parsnip, parsley, wild celery, and anise and is farmed for human consumption accidentally. Today, intentional introduction of Conium plants as a garden plant or live specimen for herbal medicine into new and existing regions is less likely.  Notes 1 Species names have Conium abbreviated as C. followed by the species taxonomy.   == References ==

A kong koan (Chinese: 公館; pinyin: gōngguǎn; Dutch: Chinezen Raad; Indonesian: Raad Tjina) or "chinese council", was a high government body in the major capitals of the Dutch East Indies, consisting of all incumbent Chinese officers in those cities. It acted as both a judicial and executive authority and constituted part of the Dutch colonial system of indirect rule. The rechtszitting, or official seat or building, housing the kong koan was called a kong tong (公堂; gōngtáng; literally "tribunal" or "law court").  Overview The Kong Koan as a government body was inseparable from the institution of Chinese officers, who were high-ranking civil administrators, appointed by the Dutch colonial authorities to govern the local Chinese community in colonial Indonesia. In the larger cities, the active officers sat as a council, the Kong Koan, in order to adjudicate justice, govern the local Chinese community and implement the directives of the colonial government. In executing these responsibilities, the Kong Koan had its own administrative staff, headed by the First Secretary or Toa Tju, and at the height of its power also had its own police force.  History Among the Chinese Councils of colonial Indonesia, the Kong Koan of Batavia was — in the words of Mary Somers Heidhues — "primus inter pares, first founded, longest serving and most powerful". In contrast, those of Surabaya, Semarang and other cities were not as old and did not serve for as long. The Batavia historian, P. de Roo de La Faille, traces the origin of the first Kong Koan to 1660, when the Dutch East India Company granted a plot of land to be used as a Chinese cemetery. According to de Roo de La Faille, the voluntary community organisation that managed the cemetery became the precursor of the Kong Koan. In the following decades, this community organisation acquired more government-related functions under the leadership of Batavia's Chinese officers. In the aftermath of the Chinese Massacre of 1740, with the ensuing Chinese War still raging in the Javanese heartland, the colonial authorities felt a need to have a better relationship with Batavia's Chinese community. This led in 1742 to the reconstitution of the capital's informal Chinese community organisation as the Kong Koan of Batavia, an official government body within the Dutch colonial bureaucracy. The High Government (Hoge Regering) provided the newly recognised council with its first Kong Tong or tribunal at Jalan Tiang Bendera in Batavia's Old Town. Membership was capped at eight and consisted of the city's active Chinese officers. The Kong Koan was presided by its most senior Chinese officer, bearing the rank of Kapitein der Chinezen until 1837, thereafter that of Majoor der Chinezen. This body assumed the character of a yamen or Qing Dynasty government department. In 1750, the council acquired an official secretary, then in 1766 an adjunct secretary. In 1809, Tan Peeng Ko, Kapitein der Chinezen of Batavia set up a subsidiary office on the southern side of the city, closer to Glodok, the Chinese quarter, to simplify the implementation of the council's day-to-day activities. In 1866, Kapitein Tan Peeng Ko's son and successor, Tan Eng Goan, the 1st Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia, officially moved the Kong Tong to larger premises in Tongkangan, where the Koan Koan remained until its abolition by the Republic of Indonesia in the early 1950s. The history of other Chinese councils is neither as old nor as well documented. The Kong Koan of Surabaya became defunct in the 1930s following the abolition of the system of Chinese officers. Similarly, the Kong Koan of Semarang, which was only founded in 1835, was dismantled in 1931.

West Adams is a neighborhood in the South Los Angeles region of Los Angeles, California. The area is known for its large number of historic buildings, structures and notable houses and mansions.  It contains several Historic Preservation Overlay Zones as well as designated historic districts.  History West Adams is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city of Los Angeles, with most of its buildings erected between 1880 and 1925, including the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library. West Adams was developed by railroad magnate Henry E. Huntington and wealthy industrialist Hulett C. Merritt of Pasadena. It was once the wealthiest district in the city, with its Victorian mansions and sturdy Craftsman bungalows, and a home to Downtown businessmen, as well as professors and academicians at the nearby University of Southern California.  1880s - 1890s In 1887, the Los Angeles Herald announced that the forthcoming St. James Park neighborhood would have a stone entrance to "rival the Arc de Triomphe" and would be eventually be surrounded by "the most costly residences yet erected on this coast". Named by George King and his wife, the couple donated the parkland to the city in commemoration of their many trips to London.  The gated community of Chester Place was developed in 1889  On October 24, 1901,  Edward L. Doheny purchased number 8 Chester Place for $120,000 cash. In 1890, "St. Margaret's School for Girls" moved from Pasadena to the city of Los Angeles. On October 1, 1890, the school opened at the corner of 23rd and Scarff Streets. Occupying the empty Marlborough Hotel, the school adopted the name of its new location and was renamed the "Marlborough School for Girls". It remained in West Adams for 26 years before relocating to Hancock Park in 1916.  1900s - 1910s In 1906, residents of the "exclusive West Adams" section experienced a water shortage because the new pipe from the Ivanhoe reservoir was not completed on time. The new reservoir would hold nearly "a billion gallons" of water. In September of that year, a Los Angeles Times reporter wrote: "The growing popularity of apartment houses is causing them to encroach on grounds heretofore exclusively reserved for high-class residences". He was reporting on "one of the handsomest apartment-houses in the city", which was designed by Thornton Fitzhue and was to be built on the southern side of St. James Park. . Landowner John R. Powers completed another apartment building in St. James Place in 1909, with an entrance also on Scarff Street. Designed by George W. Wryman, it was divided into four apartments of seven rooms each; the venture represented an investment of $35,000. In 1913, the Times announced that the Monarch Hotel was to be built in the "fashionable residence district" of West Adams. By 1916, the Los Angeles Times stated that the area was "already known for its private parks and handsome homes".  At that time, improvements to the boulevard were being spearheaded by five prominent residents including Isidore B. Dockweiler, William May Garland and Edward L. Doheny.  After convincing thirty-five other residents to help with funding, the old street paving between Figueroa and Hoover streets was replaced with asphalt surface. Adams Boulevard was now 65 feet wide and in the middle were a series of islands planted with flowers, shrubs and mature palms. Six-cluster electroliers were installed on both sides of Adams Street, which were exact duplicates of those that lined Lake Shore Drive in Chicago. Adams Boulevard was now a "magnificent concourse" and "one of the most popular drives in Los Angeles".  1920s - 1930s In 1921, the Automobile Club announced that it would build a new headquarters at Figueroa and Adams. Architects Sumner Hunt and S.R. Burns designed a building of "attractive Spanish design" that would be a "distinctive structure for the West Adams district". In 1927, during the prohibition era, the Times reported that the vice squad raided a "luxurious fourteen rooom mansion in the exclusive West Adams district". The mansion,  located at 2234 Adams Street, contained "the most extensive and elaborate moonshine production plant" they had seen in many months. In 1931, during the Great Depression, the recently organized "West Adams Relief Committee" provided work for twenty men for ninety days. Married men with families who lived in the district would and were registered voters would be paid $2 a day. Though West Adams had previously been described as "fashionable" and "exclusive", in 1937 the Times wrote: "St James Place, Chester Place, Scarff Street - those place-names mean little to present day Angelinos.  Yet they spell an aristocratic Los Angeles of the past, and to a good extent, the present. They are of the wealthy Los Angeles of a past generation, and a visitor to the neighborhood will find evidence of its elegance, if somewhat frayed and faded in spots."  1940s - 1950s African-Americans began to move in around this time. Notable residents included Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company president Norman O. Houston, actress Hattie McDaniel, civil rights activists John and Vada Sommerville, actress Louise Beavers, band leader Johnny Otis, performers Pearl Bailey and Ethel Waters. In December 1945, some of the white residents filed a lawsuit against 31 Black residents—including Hattie McDaniel. McDaniel held workshops to strategize for the case and gathered around 250 sympathizers to accompany her to court. Judge Thurmond Clarke left the courtroom to see the disputed neighborhood and threw out the case the following day. He said, "It is time that members of the Negro race are accorded, without reservations or evasions, the full rights guaranteed them under the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution. Judges have been avoiding the real issue too long." McDaniel’s case would go on to set a precedent that later impacted the 1948 Shelley v. Kramer Supreme Court Ruling which in summary states that “holding that state courts may not enforce racially restrictive covenants.”  In 1949, the headquarters building of the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company opened.  The building is a late-period Moderne structure designed by architect Paul Williams. It was once described  "…as the finest building to be erected and owned by" African-Americans in the nation"  1960s - 1970s Starting in 1961, construction of the ten-lane Santa Monica Freeway (Interstate 10) tore through West Adams' core, with the freeway routed east to west just north of Adams Boulevard. Its construction resulted in the taking by eminent domain, and demolition, of numerous West Adams homes, including a number of mansions owned by African Americans. The construction resulted in substantial displacement of West Adams residents, including the relocation of much of the area's affluent Black families. As the Los Angeles Sentinel reported:The road could have been built without cutting through the so-called Sugar Hill section. However, in order to miss Sugar Hill, it was "said" that the route would have to cut through fraternity and sorority row area around USC. Sorority and fraternity row still stands and Sugar Hill doesn't, so you know who won out!As in many other American cities during the heyday of Interstate Highway Act construction, interstate highway rights of way were disproportionately routed through predominantly African American communities, causing substantial displacement of residents and steep declines in neighborhood viability. In 1971, Los Angeles Metropolitan Medical Center opened as the city’s first black-owned hospital. According to the LA Weekly , "In the 1970s and '80s it was a thriving, vital part of the West Adams community."  1980s - present day In 2000, the Alpha Gamma Omega sorority house, a Craftsman structure built in 1911 and located in the West Adams district, received a Preserve L.A. grant from the Getty Trust. In 2004, homes were demolished and lots were cleared in the West Adams district for what was then referred to as "Central High School No. 2".  The Times reported that "a century-old neighborhood of houses and businesses" were demolished to make room for a new $130 million 15-acre high school.  West Adams Preparatory High School opened  in the fall semester of 2007 with a final budget of $176 million. In 2007, the city approved the "West Adams Streetscape Enhancement Program" proposed by LANI (Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative). Improvements included the installation of four "gateway markers" at the corners of Adams Boulevard and Western Avenue and Adams Boulevard and Vermont Avenue.  Additionally, 58 magnolia trees were planted along Adams Boulevard between Western and Vermont Avenues, along with additional trees clustered near the gateway markers. In 2011, the Times reported on neighbors pushing back against crime and wrote: "The neighborhood around them at Western Avenue and Adams Boulevard might be blighted, but they are not about to cede to urban ills their graceful streets of century-old bungalows, well-tended lawns and curbside jacarandas and towering palms." In 2016, then-rep.(D-Los Angeles) and now mayor Karen Bass, said "I tour people through the area all the time and they are surprised when they see beautiful homes, because it's not the perception of the neighborhood." That same year, an empty West Adams Hospital was transformed into a temporary art gallery.  Geography The City of Los Angeles Beginning in 2000, the Eighth District Empowerment Congress began working on the "Naming Neighborhoods Project" to identify and name the communities with the neighborhood council area.  Through research, a meeting with an urban historian, and numerous community meetings, sixteen neighborhoods, including the neighborhood of West Adams, were submitted to City Council in October 2001 and approved in February 2002. At that time, the city was directed to install "West Adams"  neighborhood signs on Vermont, Western and Adams Boulevards  West Adams is bounded by Western Avenue on the west, Vermont Avenue on the east, Jefferson Boulevard on the south and the Santa Monica Freeway on the north. Additionally, the area is marked with large concrete "gateway markers" at Western and Adams and Vermont and Adams.  Los Angeles Times and other sources According to the Los Angeles Times, West Adams is bounded by Figueroa Street on the east, West Boulevard on the west, Pico Boulevard on the north and Jefferson Boulevard on the south. (Previously, the Times defined West Adams with a slightly smaller boundary: Vermont Avenue on the east, Crenshaw Boulevard on the west, Venice Boulevard on the north, and Jefferson Boulevard on the south.) The book Images of America - West Adams by Don Lynch, Suzanne Tarbell Cooper, and John Kurtz states that West Adams stretches "roughly from Figueroa Street on the east to West Boulevard on the west, and from Pico Boulevard on the north to Jefferson Boulevard on the south."  Historic districts More than 70 sites in West Adams have received recognition as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, a California Historical Landmark, or listing on the National Register of Historic Places. In recognition of their outstanding architectural heritage, there are several Historic Preservation Overlay Zones within West Adams, including: (listed in alphabetical order)  Tracts and neighborhoods West Adams is home to one of the largest collections of historic houses and small mansions west of the Mississippi River and contains many diverse architectural styles including: Queen Anne, Shingle, Gothic Revival, Transitional Arts and Crafts, American Craftsman/Ultimate Bungalow, Craftsman Bungalow, Colonial Revival, Renaissance Revival, Mediterranean Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival, Mission Revival, Egyptian Revival, Beaux-Arts and Neoclassical styles. West Adams boasts the only existing Greene and Greene house left in the city of Los Angeles.  Kinney Heights Kinney Heights was developed around 1900 by developer Abbot Kinney, for whom it is named. It was a suburban tract of large wealthy Craftsman style houses at what was then the western edge of Los Angeles. The houses featured amenities like "beveled-glass china cabinets, marble fireplaces and mahogany floors". It was accessible to downtown via streetcar and attracted upper-class families.  Twentieth Street Historic District The Twentieth Street Historic District consists of a row of bungalows and Craftsman-style houses in the 900 block on the south side of 20th Street.  Charles Victor Hall tract The West Adams Neighborhood Association covers the historic Charles Victor Hall tract, dating to 1894, bounded by Western Avenue on the west, Adams Boulevard on the north, Normandie Avenue to the east, and south to Jefferson Boulevard.  Demographics In 1985, West Adams was a predominantly "Black middle-class area with growing Latino and Korean segments, plus a mix of Hungarians, Poles, Japanese, USC students and an increasing young professional and gay population." In 2007, it was noted that African-American gays were "eschewing the overpriced and completely gentrified territory of West Hollywood" and were instead moving to West Adams. In 2014, the Times stated that "after a recent wave of Latino immigration", young professionals were purchasing homes in the neighborhoods west of USC, including the "stately Victorian and Craftsman mansions of West Adams" and the "smaller Craftsman bungalows" of Jefferson Park. According to Mapping L.A., Mexican (29.2%) and Salvadoran (5.7%) were the most common ancestries in 2000. Mexico (37.4%) and El Salvador (25.1%) were the most common foreign places of birth.  Education The schools within the West Adams neighborhood include:  32nd Street / USC Performing Arts Magnet, LAUSD, 822 W. 32nd St. John W. Mack Elementary School, LAUSD, 3020 S.

William Adamson (2 April 1863 – 23 February 1936) was a Scottish trade unionist and Labour Party politician. He was Leader of the Labour Party from 1917 to 1921 and was Secretary of State for Scotland in 1924 and during 1929–1931 in the first two Labour ministries headed by Ramsay MacDonald.  Background Adamson was born in Dunfermline, Fife, and was educated at a local dame school. He worked as a miner in Fife where he became involved with the National Union of Mineworkers. In 1902–08 he was Assistant Secretary of the Fife and Kinross Miners' Association, and he thereafter served as its General Secretary.  Political career Active with the new Labour Party, Adamson was first elected to Parliament for West Fife in the December 1910 general election. His victory was the only Labour gain from the Liberals in that election. Adamson was elected Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party on 24 October 1917, a post he held until 1921. He led the party into the general election of 1918, which saw Labour gain 15 seats and become the largest opposition party in the House of Commons for the first time; however, there remained uncertainty as to whether Adamson or the leader of the independent Liberals, Donald Maclean could claim to be the true leader of the opposition in the Commons. In 1918 he was sworn into the Privy Council.  In 1919, Adamson was confident that the experience of the First World War would "produce a different atmosphere and an entirely different relationship amongst all sections of our people" and would act as a watershed in the process of social reform.  He served as Secretary for Scotland and Secretary of State for Scotland in 1924 and between 1929 and 1931 in the Labour governments of Ramsay MacDonald. However, he split with MacDonald after the formation of the National Government. Adamson lost his seat in the 1931 election which he contested for Labour against MacDonald's coalition. He stood again in the 1935 election but again failed to take the seat, losing on this occasion to William Gallacher of the Communist Party of Great Britain.  Personal life Adamson was married to Christina Myles Marshall (1862–1935), a factory worker, with whom he had two daughters and two sons; one of the latter was killed during the First World War. Adamson died in February 1936, aged 72. He is buried in Dunfermline Cemetery, just north of the roundel at the end of the entrance avenue.

Further, her hands-on approach in accompanying the detectives is at odds with Detective Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni), who does not believe he is able to do his job with Greylek looking over his shoulder. In the episode "Babes", Greylek angers a woman believed to be involved with a young girl's suicide, but she was found not guilty. After gloating about her innocence, the woman physically attacks Greylek in the courtroom for correcting her about being "innocent" and to wash the blood off her hands before holding her daughter's baby. When the officers pull the woman off her, Greylek tells Stabler to charge her with assault. However, Greylek has shown a softer side; warning Stabler to get a good defense attorney for his daughter Kathleen (Allison Siko), in the episode "Swing". Kathleen, who has bipolar disorder, is charged with breaking & entering in conjunction with theft, and the DA's office will prosecute her. In the episode "Smut", Greylek successfully prosecutes serial rapist Eric Lutz (Michael Trucco), who claims that his actions were caused by violent pornography; Greylek tracks down Lutz's former fiancée, whom he also raped, and gets her to testify that Lutz does not use pornography and is simply violent by nature. Greylek also seeks justice when a man is brutally beaten outside a strip club, with the man's ex-wife and 13-year-old transgender daughter Hailey (Bridger Zadina) as the prime suspects, in the episode "Transitions". Before the case gets to trial, detectives Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler discover that it was Haley's guidance counselor who committed the crime. During the trial, Greylek uncovers that the guidance counselor is also a transgender woman and that is why she tried to help Haley. The character is written out in episode "Lead", during the middle of a trial where pediatrician Gilbert Keppler (Lawrence Arancio) is found guilty of molesting his patients. Greylek is last seen doing a press conference with Captain Don Cragen (Dann Florek), Benson, and Stabler on the steps of the courthouse. When the doctor's attorney hands the SVU squad a lawsuit, Greylek responds, "What did you people do?". Later in the episode, Benson and Stabler discover the doctor murdered in his home. The detectives hold CSU out of the house until Cragen and Greylek get to the scene in case IAB wants to "screw with" them again. Sergeant John Munch (Richard Belzer) asks if they are sure Greylek isn't on one of her "'I need to be at the crime scene' crusades again", when Detective Fin Tutuola (Ice-T) realises "It's not Greylek" and they all see ADA Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) walk up to the scene with Cragen. Cabot tells the detectives that the Justice Department called Greylek back to D.C. and that District Attorney Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) let her leave immediately.  Development After the departure of Diane Neal, who portrayed ADA Casey Novak from the fifth to ninth season of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Michaela McManus was approached to replace her. McManus, who departed One Tree Hill for the role, was cast as a series regular in the capacity of Assistant District Attorney. On the casting, creator and executive producer of SVU Dick Wolf claimed, "We look forward to [McManus] working with Neal [Baer], Ted [Kotcheff] and me to create another interesting and memorable character in the Law & Order universe". The character was originally to be named "Polly Sturges", according to McManus. Then-SVU showrunner Neal Baer instead chose to name the character "Kim Greylek"; "Kim" after American actress Kim Novak (who also inspired the name of SVU character Casey Novak) and "Greylek" after Novak's character in the 1955 film 5 Against the House. In the series, Greylek departs to D.C. in the fifteenth episode "Lead" and is replaced by Cabot (March) in a recurring capacity (while McManus continued to appear in the opening credits for the rest of the season). However, In April 2009, it was confirmed by TV Guide that McManus would not be returning to SVU, with no response from NBC as to why she departed. On her departure, Baer noted that, "She's [McManus] moved on. Sometimes the part and the actor just don't mesh. It was a mutual decision."  Credits McManus is credited in 22 episodes of SVU (appearing in 13) as Greylek, making her the shortest-serving ADA in this series.   == References ==

The AN/FPS-124 is an unattended radar (UAR) providing short range, Doppler radar surveillance of airborne targets. It provides target information to the Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC), and employs built-in-test, performance monitoring/fault isolation and system redundancy enabling it to reconfigure itself when fault detection occurs. The AN/FPS-117 and AN/FPS-124 form an array of radars stretching across North America from Alaska, United States to Labrador, Canada. This North Warning System is designed to provide long-range detection and coverage for drug interdiction support and tactical command and control. Implementation of the North Warning System has resulted in a reduction in Operations and Maintenance (O&M) spending by up to 50% compared to previous systems. Due to extreme northern locations of some of these radars, the physics of radiowave propagation in the 1215–1400 MHz frequency range is even more critical for target detection requirements. The AN/FPS-124 is intended to cover any surveillance gaps left by the North Warning System's long range radar, the AN/FPS-117.  Classification of radar systems  Under the Joint Electronics Type Designation System (JETDS), all U.S. military radar and tracking systems are assigned a unique identifying alphanumeric designation. The letters “AN” (for Army-Navy) are placed ahead of a three-letter code.  The first letter of the three-letter code denotes the type of platform hosting the electronic device, where A=Aircraft, F=Fixed (land-based), S=Ship-mounted, and T=Ground transportable. The second letter indicates the type of equipment, where P=Radar (pulsed), Q=Sonar, and R=Radio. The third letter indicates the function or purpose of the device, where G=Fire control, R=Receiving, S=Search, and T=Transmitting. Thus, the AN/FPS-124 represents the 124th design of an Army-Navy “Fixed, Radar, Search” electronic device.   == References ==

Dennis Mengoy Cagara (born 19 February 1985) is a retired Danish–Filipino professional footballer who played as a left back. He represented the Philippines at international level, having previously played for Denmark at various youth levels.  Early life Born in Glostrup to a Filipino father and Danish mother, Cagara started playing youth football at Brøndby IF.  Club career Cagara turned professional in March 2001, as he signed a 2+1⁄2-year contract with Brøndby. In April 2002, Cagara was reportedly scouted by Ajax Amsterdam scout Leo Beenhakker, but was found playing too nervously. Cagara made his senior debut for Brøndby at age 17 years and 220 days on 10 October 2002, making him the youngest debutant of the Danish Superliga championship, and the fourth youngest debutant in Brøndby club history, Cagara played seven league games for the club in the 2002–03 Superliga season, and was a part of the Brøndby team which won the 2003 Danish Cup trophy. In July 2003, Cagara signed a pre-contract with German club Hertha BSC, starting on 1 January 2004. In the fall of 2003, Cagara suffered from hepatitis, and he only played one game for Brøndby in the 2003–04 season, against Dinamo Minsk in the 2003–04 UEFA Cup. At 18 years of age, Cagara moved abroad to play for Hertha in the winter transfer window of January 2004. He played the last eight games of the 2003–04 Bundesliga season for Hertha, and helped the club avoid relegation. In the 2004–05 season, Cagara played for Hertha's reserve team. In the summer 2005, Cagara was loaned out to Dynamo Dresden in the lower Second Bundesliga division. He spent the entire 2005–06 season at Dresden, playing 28 games and scoring two goals. He re-entered the Hertha first team squad for the 2006–07 Bundesliga season. His injury recovered slowly, and he did not play any games for Hertha during that season, as Malik Fathi became Hertha's starting left defender. Cagara expressed desire to rejoin Brøndby in November 2006, which Hertha denied in the short term. A week before the transfer deadline passed, on 22 August 2007, Cagara agreed a loan to the Copenhagen-based club FC Nordsjælland. His explosive and offensive playing style made him a fan favourite and he quickly became a regular starter at the club. Having started the last 6 matches, he scored a spectacular long range half-volley goal against Superliga Champions FC Copenhagen in the 87th minute which gave his side points. The goal was the first FCK had conceded at home in months. On 22 May 2008, he signed a two-year contract with FC Nordsjælland, moving to the club on a Bosman transfer. On 23 January 2010, he was granted a free transfer by FC Nordsjælland and signed a contract for the rest of the 2009–10 season with AGF Aarhus. On 16 March 2011, he signed a contract for the rest of the season with Randers FC.  He never made any first-team appearances for the club and was released at the end of the season. He signed up with Lyngby by the start of the 2011–12 Danish Superliga season. He made 15 appearances for the club. He was however released by the end of 2011. Seeking a new club, he went to Germany for trials with 3. Liga side Chemnitzer FC and made an appearance in their friendly match with Hansa Rostock II, playing 64 minutes as they won 3–1.  However, he did not sign for them.  He then had trials with 2. Bundesliga side FSV Frankfurt and on 31 January 2012, he signed for the club until the end of the 2011–12 season with an option another year. On 4 March 2012, he made his debut in a 4–3 loss against Erzgebirge Aue. He came in as a substitute at the 78th minute. Following the death of his mother, both Cagara and the club agreed not to grant him an extension, and was therefore released at the end of the 2011–12 season after having five appearances for the club. Cagara signed for Karlsruher SC on a two-year deal in June 2012. In September 2013, Cagara signed for Lyngby. After making 15 appearances for the club during the 2013–14 season, his contract was not renewed. By mid-August 2014, he signed a six-month contract with Danish 2nd Division side Hvidovre.  International career While at Brøndby's youth academy, he made his international debut for the Danish under-16 national team in November 2000. Cagara represented Denmark at the 2002 European Under-17 Championship. He played full-time in Denmark's four games, though he missed one of the penalty kicks as Denmark were eliminated by penalty shoot-out in the quarter-finals. At the age of 18, Cagara made his debut for the Denmark national under-21 football team on 6 June 2003. He suffered an injured Achilles tendon in May 2006, and could not represent Denmark at the 2006 European Under-21 Championship. On 7 October 2011, Cagara made his debut for the Philippines at the senior level during a friendly match against Singapore. The match ended in a 2–0 defeat. In his next match, however, he proved to be instrumental as the Philippines won against Nepal, 4–0. Cagara announced his interest of participation in the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup, citing that it is a once in a lifetime opportunity. He was included in the final 23-man squad with jersey number 35. However, he failed to join the team in Nepal. In November 2012, Cagara was part of the Philippine team in group stages of the ASEAN Football Federation Suzuki Cup (2012 AFF Suzuki Cup), the football championship of Southeast Asia, which was hosted by Thailand and Malaysia. He played in all three matches of the group A stage in Thailand.  Personal life Cagara is married to Natashia. The couple has one child (Milas). Cagara's older brother Sunny is an entertainer, who participated in Talent 2009, the Danish version of America's Got Talent.  Honours Brøndby  Danish Cup: 2002–03 Karlsruher SC  3.

Petronėlė Gerlikienė, née Kromelyte (June 19, 1905, Chicago, United States – March 14, 1979, Vilnius, Lithuania), was a Lithuanian painter and textile folk artist.  She lived and worked in a farm in Samogitia; after retiring, she moved to Vilnius to live with her son's family. Gerlikiene began creating large-scale tapestries in 1972, paintings in 1976 and began participating in exhibitions in 1974. Petronele Gerlikiene's art has won recognition and numerous prizes in Lithuania and abroad.  Life and works Petronele Gerlikiene entered the Lithuanian art scene at quite a venerable age after she retired and was living with her son's family in Vilnius. She started embroidering tapestries of a very large scale; to make them she used different techniques such as embroidery and application. She was fascinated with big trees and used it as a motif for her first tapestries An Oak, A Rowan, A Maple Tree and A Red Tree.  About her textile artwork, Man and Woman Petronele said: “I need to have a very translucent yellow background in order to embroider Paradise. Paradise is above the houses and only the thin branches of trees covered in blossoms and fruit support Adam and Eve. Adam is naked and worry-free. His soft and relaxed body, with clearly marked Adam's apple, seems to sway weightlessly in the air. With his hands on the stomach, he moves his toes enjoying Paradise. Eve by his side is interpreted very differently, as a contrast to Adam, she is full of anxiety: Her skirt is so bouffant ... The woman must always be more beautiful than the man. She holds a bouquet of forget-me-nots.” Eve's body is tense, she is focused and ready--she knows what awaits her". ("Petronele Gerlikiene", LTS, 2005, p. 53.) She was encouraged by her daughter-in-law, who brought pieces of cardboard and paint from her son's (professional painter) studio. Petronele was amazed that she could paint so quickly and effortlessly. She always had a clearly formed idea of the painting, its composition, and combinations of colours in her head. She painted fast, hurrying as if in oblivion, without sketches, dabbing paint directly from the tube, mixing the colours right on the cardboard or canvas. First, with a dry brush, with its stem (“why stroke and daub needlessly”), Petronele would outline the place of the main character. She only used a palette for putting paint tubes on it. Like this, in one fell swoop, she created her first painting, Under the Maple, Under the Green One…: “This is after the song “under the maple, under the green one, there's a young lad lying…” and, of course, a young girl is handing her heart to him. The girl's heart is always bigger than the boy's." The very next day she demanded a large piece of cardboard – she intended to draw The Ship – Noah's Ark. Petronele outlined a big oval – the ship and began placing people aboard. First of all, she drew Noah and his seven daughters, then animals and birds, a couple of each. Noah and his daughters are rowing. Noah often turns and watches his eldest daughter in the stern, because his wife is very old and she only sits by the chest with her cane. "In this way, the human race has survived..." Petronele Gerlikiene's most mature and emotionally strongest works, The Sorrowful One, A Mother, The Virgin, and Benefaction are broad-brush works and extremely poignant. Each work has a diversity of colours, a freedom of composition, and a powerful sense of wholeness. The emotional expressiveness and inner strength allows the comparison of her paintings to works of professional painters. Moreover, Gerlikiene's works often surpass those made by professionals in terms of originality of the vision, uniqueness of interpretation, and humour. Petronele's most characteristic way of expression is colour. One of the most painterly yet most laconic pictures is The Sorrowful One, she uses only three colours: red, black and white. Her intuitive feeling for colour dictates her very unusual and unexpected colour combinations. Petronele's world is dominated by people. Figures are often depicted in motion and communicating with each other and the beholder. Her creative world encompasses whole human life with all its aspects, but most important subjects are woman's fate and man's and woman's relationship. These “eternal” subjects interpreted with understanding and humour, men are often ridiculed like in the picture Picking Cherries: calm, smiling woman pulls a man by the hand into a lake. “If a man is afraid, he can grab hold of a calf's tail out of fear.” Petronele loved to paint piquant situations, love dramas and psychologically complicated situations. She was positive that she was portraying everything lifelike. "Petronele Gerlikiene", LTS, 2005 Petronele Gerlikiene was illiterate. As a child she had no possibility of going to school, later she felt there was no need for it. In seven intensely creative years, Petronele has created 11 large-scale tapestries and more than 60 paintings.

Gothic! Ten Original Dark Tales is a compilation of young adult horror short stories, edited by Deborah Noyes. It was published in 2004 by Candlewick Press.  Background The stories in this book are gothic. The compiler summarized what she thinks of gothic as, "It's probably more accurate to think of gothic as a room within the larger house of horror. Its decor is distinctive. It insists on burden of the past. It also gleefully turns our ideas of good and evil on end." While most of the short stories are gothic, a reviewer for Teen Reads said that there are stories that are both dark and funny. The authors in this novel include Joan Aiken, Vivian Vande Velde, M.T. Anderson, Neil Gaiman, Caitlin R. Kiernan, Barry Yourgrau, Janni Lee Simmer, Gregory Maguire, Celia Rees, and Garth Nix.  Contents "Lungewater" is about a ghost that haunts a river in the gloomy countryside. "Morgan Rochemar's Boy" is about a ghost that haunts a hay ride. "Watch and Wake" is about a boy that visits a town that does not seem normal. "Forbidden Brides of the Faceless Slaves in the Nameless House of the Night of Dread Desire" is a parody of Gothic literature. "The Dead and the Moonstruck" is a coming-of-age tale with a gothic twist. "Have No Fear, Crumpot Is Here" is about a boy that is forced to go on a summer trip to Italy that he will never forget. "Stone Tower" is a story that is a mix of fairy tale and gothic. "The Prank" is about two characters that suffer from guilt. One person from an older one, one person from a recent one. "Writing on the Wall" is about a ghost that haunts a house. "Endings" is told from the perspective of a vampire.  Awards The book was nominated for a Locus Poll Award in 2005 in the category Best Young Adult Book. The book is An American Library Association (ALA) Best Book for Young Adults, A Kirkus Reviews Editors’ Choice, A Junior Library Guild Selection, A VOYA Best Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and Horror Title, and A New York Public Library Book for the Teen Age.  Reception The book is listed in Best Books for Young Adults which is from the Young Adult Library Services Association. The book is also listed in The Year's Best Science Fiction: Twenty-Second Annual Collection by Gardner Dozois. Joseph DeMarco, of Kliatt, said that readers will not be disappointed and that they will have trouble forgetting the horror. Jennifer Mattson, of Booklist, liked the book despite its clichés.   == References ==

Amos Henry Hawley (December 5, 1910 – August 31, 2009) was an American sociologist. Hawley studied extensively how human populations interacted with their changing environments along with the growth of populations. He focused his studies on the behavior of populations in terms of organization, development, and change over space and time.  Career He was awarded a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from the University of Cincinnati in 1936. At the University of Cincinnati Hawley took an Introduction to Sociology under professor James A. Quinn who had been a student at the Chicago School of Sociology taught by Robert E. Park. In his course of study, several books affected how Hawley conceived of human ecology. These works included An Introduction to the Science of Sociology by Robert E. Park and E.W. Burgess (1921), Social Organization by C.H. Cooley (1929), and Mind, Self, and Society by G.H. Mead (1934). Hawley pursued his Ph.D at the University of Michigan where he was mentored by Roderick D. McKenzie. McKenzie suffered from a degenerative disease and while he slowly succumbed he assigned Hawley to teach a few of his classes. Hawley was appointed as an instructor in the Sociology department after turning in his dissertation and McKenzie's death in 1940. Hawley was a professor and the Chairman of the Department of Sociology at the University of Michigan. While teaching Hawley printed the 1950 book Human Ecology, which had an international effect on the field of sociology. Hawley taught as professor at Michigan from 1941 to 1966, he served as chair of the Sociology department at University of Michigan for ten years (1951–1961). During World War II, Hawley served as a consultant  to the Department of the Army, Department of the Air Force, the Housing and Home Finance Agency, and the Scripps Foundation for Population Research. Hawley was a visiting professor at the University of the Philippines and was a Fulbright Research Scholar at the University of Naples. Utilizing his expertize he worked as a consultant on population policy to the Prime Minister of Thailand and helped the Prime Minister conduct Thailand's national census. After concluding his travels, Hawley returned to the United States to teach at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill as Sociology Professor (1966–1976). He was Kenan Professor Emeritus in Sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1971–1976). In 1971, Hawley was the President of the Population Association of America. He was the 69th President of the American Sociological Association in 1978.  Ideas and influences Amos Hawley was influenced by Roderick D. McKenzie, who was mentored by Robert E. Park and E.W. Burgess of the Chicago School of Sociology. Roderick McKenzie published several works on a number of topics ranging from immigration (Oriental Exclusion, 1927), economics ( L'evolution economique due monde, 1928), and to urbanism ( The Metropolitan Community, 1933). McKenzie influenced Hawley through his idea that it is necessary to understand change through space and time among populations or an aggregate. Hawley learned from Mckenzie that humans are observable units within an ecosystem with a given technology they will interact with their environment and develop predictable patterns. Hawley expanded McKenzie's work on population studies and human interaction with the environment further. Hawley contended that "the environment, population, and the ecosystem tend to move toward equilibrium" (Human Ecology, p. 10). In his book, Human Ecology, Hawley wrote that humans will modify their behavior patterns to fit with changes in their biophysical environment. Through this adaption human groups can either evolve or expand into complex societies. For systemic change to occur, such as expansion of a population, disequilibrium is required along with multiple challenges to the environment. Hawley studied rigorously the nature of change and communities and their relation to time and space. Cumulative change is when a series of increments or a single increment within a social system forms a foundation for the next increment.  In his study of change, Hawley strove to answer the question "Are there events or circumstances which lead inexorably toward cumulative change?" Hawley found that change is irreversible because a series of events within a state of time cannot go backward in time. Evolution, as viewed by those in the scientific community was an outcome of cumulative change along with expansion of population. To understand if a given population will expand or evolve, Hawley questioned whether "complexity and scale were concurrent." He concluded that "when complexity and scale advance more or less together, the effect is growth or expansion rather than evolution". By understanding the concepts behind population expansion and evolution, Hawley explored how all organisms are connected  to the environment and through behavior. Amos Hawley believed that organisms are connected in a web of relationships that interdependent and are enmeshed with the environment. In the web of relationships organisms can have relationships of symbiosis or commensalism. Symboisis is the close bond relationship between the two individuals of two different species. Commensalism is when organisms make similar demands on the environment often resulting in competition. Hawley believed humanity was dominant in the ecosystem due to advances in technology and humanity's control over the habitat. He contended that through culture humanity is able to modify its subsistence to match its needs and desires. Hawley writes "thus the development of human dominance through the agency of culture involves a reconstruction of the biotic community.  Instead of accommodating his activities, as do primitive peoples, to the natural life association, civilized man regulates the biotic community in accordance with his needs".    == References ==

Rational egoism (also called rational selfishness) is the principle that an action is rational if and only if it maximizes one's self-interest. As such, it is considered a normative form of egoism, though historically has been associated with both positive and normative forms. In its strong form, rational egoism holds that to not pursue one's own interest is unequivocally irrational. Its weaker form, however, holds that while it is rational to pursue self-interest, failing to pursue self-interest is not always irrational. Originally an element of nihilist philosophy in Russia, it was later popularised in English-speaking countries by Russian-American author Ayn Rand.  Origins Rational egoism (Russian: разумный эгоизм) emerged as the dominant social philosophy of the Russian nihilist movement, having developed in the works of nihilist philosophers Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Dmitry Pisarev. However, their terminology was largely obfuscated to avoid government censorship and the name rational egoism explicitly is unmentioned in the writings of both philosophers. Rational egoism was further embodied in Chernyshevsky's 1863 novel What Is to Be Done?, and was criticised in response by Fyodor Dostoyevsky in his 1864 work Notes from Underground. For Chernyshevsky, rational egoism served as the basis for the socialist development of human society. English philosopher Henry Sidgwick discussed rational egoism in his book The Methods of Ethics, first published in 1872. A method of ethics is "any rational procedure by which we determine what individual human beings 'ought'—or what it is 'right' for them—to do, or seek to realize by voluntary action". Sidgwick considers three such procedures, namely, rational egoism, dogmatic intuitionism, and utilitarianism. Rational egoism is the view that, if rational, "an agent regards quantity of consequent pleasure and pain to himself alone important in choosing between alternatives of action; and seeks always the greatest attainable surplus of pleasure over pain". Sidgwick found it difficult to find any persuasive reason for preferring rational egoism over utilitarianism. Although utilitarianism can be provided with a rational basis and reconciled with the morality of common sense, rational egoism appears to be an equally plausible doctrine regarding what we have most reason to do. Thus we must "admit an ultimate and fundamental contradiction in our apparent intuitions of what is Reasonable in conduct; and from this admission it would seem to follow that the apparently intuitive operation of Practical Reason, manifested in these contradictory judgments, is after all illusory".  Ayn Rand The author and philosopher Ayn Rand also discusses a theory that she called rational egoism. She holds that it is both irrational and immoral to act against one's self-interest. Thus, her view is a conjunction of both rational egoism (in the standard sense) and ethical egoism, because according to Objectivist philosophy, egoism cannot be properly justified without an epistemology based on reason. Her book The Virtue of Selfishness (1964) explains the concept of rational egoism in depth. According to Rand, a rational man holds his own life as his highest value, rationality as his highest virtue, and his happiness as the final purpose of his life. Conversely, Rand was sharply critical of the ethical doctrine of altruism:  Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights of others. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute is self-sacrifice—which means self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial self-destruction—which means the self as a standard of evil, the selfless as a standard of the good. Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should not give a dime to a beggar. This is not the issue. The issue is whether you do or do not have the right to exist without giving him that dime. The issue is whether you must keep buying your life, dime by dime, from any beggar who might choose to approach you. The issue is whether the need of others is the first mortgage on your life and the moral purpose of your existence. The issue is whether man is to be regarded as a sacrificial animal. Any man of self-esteem will answer: No. Altruism says: Yes.  Criticism Two objections to rational egoism are given by the English philosopher Derek Parfit, who discusses the theory at length in Reasons and Persons (1984). First, from the rational egoist point of view, it is rational to contribute to a pension scheme now, even though this is detrimental to one's present interests (which are to spend the money now). But it seems equally reasonable to maximize one's interests now, given that one's reasons are not only relative to him, but to him as he is now (and not his future self, who is argued to be a "different" person). Parfit also argues that since the connections between the present mental state and the mental state of one's future self may decrease, it is not plausible to claim that one should be indifferent between one's present and future self.

Pedro Moya de Contreras (sometimes Pedro de Moya y Contreras) (c. 1528, Pedroche, Córdoba Province, Spain – December 21, 1591, Madrid) was a prelate and colonial administrator who held the three highest offices in the Spanish colony of New Spain, namely inquisitor general, Archbishop of Mexico, and Viceroy of Mexico, September 25, 1584 – October 17, 1585. He was the 6th Viceroy, governing from September 25, 1584, to October 16, 1585. During this interval he held all three positions.  Ecclesiastical career Moya de Contreras received the degree of doctor of canon law from the University of Salamanca. Later he became head of the cathedral school in the Canary Islands, and then inquisitor of Murcia. In 1571 he became the first inquisitor general of New Spain (and thus the first inquisitor general in the New World). He established the Tribunal del Santo Oficio in Mexico City in 1571. As inquisitor general he required people of New Spain, from the oidores (members of the Audiencia), nobles and religious to the most humble members of society, to solemnly swear to defend the Catholic faith and persecute heretics "as rabid dogs and wolves, infectors of spirits and destroyers of the vineyard of Our Lord." He celebrated the first auto-da-fé in New Spain in 1571. Two years later, on June 15, 1573, Moya de Contreras was chosen Archbishop of Mexico and consecrated bishop on November 21, 1573, by Antonio Ruíz de Morales y Molina, Bishop of Tlaxcala (Puebla de los Angeles). He served until 1591, the year of his death. In 1585 he convoked and presided at the Third Provincial Council of the Church in Mexico, which established standards for the Church that endured to the end of the colonial era. This council banned the enslavement of the Indians. As both archbishop and viceroy, one of his major concerns was education of the Indians. He founded the Seminary of the Indies, to teach them Christian doctrine, reading, writing, singing and trades. While bishop, he was the principal consecrator of Juan de Medina Rincón y de la Vega, Bishop of Michoacán (1574); Francisco Gómez de Mendiola y Solórzano, Bishop of Guadalajara (1574); and Alfonso Graniero Avalos, Bishop of La Plata o Charcas (1579).  Political career In 1583 Moya de Contreras's predecessor as viceroy, Lorenzo Suárez de Mendoza, 4th conde de la Coruña, asked King Philip II to name a special visitador (royal inspector) to help resolve a conflict between the viceroy and the Audiencia. Philip named Moya, then the sitting Archbishop of Mexico. As visitador, he took up the accusations against the corrupt oidores and other officials of the viceroyalty. He dismissed the former and punished the latter, some by hanging. In a letter reporting to the king, he praised those officials who had honestly met their obligations, and castigated others. Suárez de Mendoza died in June, 1583. The Audiencia was formally in charge of the colony for 16 months, until the installation of the new viceroy. However, Moya de Contreras continued in the position of visitador during the interregnum, with much influence. In 1584, he was named viceroy to succeed Suárez. He took up the new position on September 25, 1584. He now held the three most important positions in the colony. With this concentration of power, he was able to remedy many of the prevalent abuses, with immediate punishment for those found to be transgressors of the law or of decency. This resulted in much enmity among the governing class, but the lower classes proclaimed him as their defender. He was able to increase rents and payments to Spain considerably. In 1584 he resigned as viceroy, but retained his other positions (including visitador) for a little longer while he wound up his affairs before returning to Spain. Upon his return, he became president of the Council of the Indies, a position he held until his death. Moya de Contreras died in Spain in December, 1591, so poor that the Crown paid for his funeral. His body was interred in the parish church of Santiago, in Madrid. He left various writings which were collected in the book Cartas de Indias, published in Madrid in 1877.

Qian Yongchang (Chinese: 钱永昌; 1936 – 1995) was a Chinese serial killer who killed 15 people from 1959 to 1995 across three provinces, out of a self-professed contempt for how society had treated him. At the time of his arrest, Qian's advanced age led to him being labeled the country's oldest active serial killer, as well as one of the longest active, with his killing spree lasting more than three decades and a half. For his last crimes, he was convicted, sentenced to death and executed.  Early life Qian Yongchan was born in 1936, in Banqiao Town, Shilin Yi Autonomous County. The only child of poor farmers, he dropped out of school early as he had no interest in studying and instead started working odd jobs to support his family. During this time, he also began committing petty thefts. In 1958, he was hired to work as a laborer in the construction of the Guikun Railway in Xuanwei, and while working there, he was regarded positively by his colleagues. Owing to his eloquent speech and easygoing personality, Qian attracted the attention of several women, including the wife of the contractor, with whom he began an affair.  Murders First murder and early crimes Qian's affair with the contractor's wife continued up until October 1959, when the pair were accidentally found out by a co-worker of his. Fearing that the man would reveal their inappropriate relationship, Qian asked the man to follow him, ostensibly under the pretense to bribe him into silence. The pair went to the edge of a nearby cliff, where Qian pushed the co-worker off and let him fall into the abyss. He then returned to his mistress and openly admitted to what he had just done, and while she did not tell anybody else what had happened, the pair ended their liaison by mutual agreement. When it came to the other workers, while some questioned what had happened to the man, most of them just brushed it off as him deciding to leave of his own accord, which was considered normal in this line of work. After this incident, Qian experienced a drastic shift in personality, becoming more irritable and quickly resorting to fistfights to solve his problems. In 1960, he was sentenced to a year in prison for assaulting another man, which he spent at the detention center in Kunming. After his release, with no income or desire to work honestly, he resorted to stealing and robbing people. Because of this, Qian was arrested for theft in 1962 and sent to a labor camp in Kunming, where he spent a year doing labor-intensive work. He continued stealing even after his latest release and was repeatedly incarcerated from 1964 to 1967, with his latest arrest landing him in another labor camp, where he remained until 1973.  1974–1994 After being released from prison yet again, Qian stopped with the thefts, but after a few months, he decided to engage in robberies instead. In August 1974, he was in Liuzhou, Guangxi when he confronted a merchant who was passing by. After stealing the man's money, Qian killed him and quickly fled to avoid capture. The following month, he robbed and killed a merchant who was selling mushrooms in Guiyang, Guizhou. While he managed to avoid arrest in either of these cases, Qian would nevertheless be arrested on charges of being a counter-revolutionary and interned at the Ludong Coal Mine in Qujing, where he would remain from 1974 to 1983. Shortly before his scheduled release, he escaped and remained a fugitive for a short time before being arrested for fraud and imprisoned the following year. He was then sent to the Ying Coal Mine, where he was interned until 2 January 1994. Upon his release, he returned to his hometown.  Final crimes Once he returned to Shilin Yi, the now 58-year-old Qian decided it would be impractical to continue with the robberies because of his old age, but as he had no practical skills and was unwilling to work, he instead resorted to stealing whatever he could and then selling it. As time passed, the money he got became less and less, leading Qian to grow restless. This only worsened once he started paying attention to other people of his age, all of whom had children and even grandchildren, leaving him to feel alone and jealous of their happy lives. Because of this, this eventually led him to the decision that he would take out his anger on his robbery victims, which usually ended with deadly consequences. From May to August 1994, Qian robbed and killed three migrants workers in Kunming and Hechi. His modus operandi was to stake out cheap hotels where poor migrants workers usually lived, and once he selected his victim, he would break into their room while they were asleep and repeatedly bludgeon them with a hammer, before finally stealing all of their savings. Because of the lack of surveillance and the myriad of people who lived in these establishments, most of whom had no ID cards, it was difficult to solve the cases. From January until 27 October 1995, Qian attacked ten additional victims, nine of whom died, while the last one was left in a vegetative state.  Arrest, trial and execution After a rigorous investigation by the authorities, they were eventually given some details regarding their suspect: according to witness testimonies, he was supposedly surnamed Qian, had served time in labor camps under the name "Qian Guan", appeared to be in his 50s and had a distinctive mole under his nose. Utilizing this description, the investigators distributed the description to the staff of all major hotels, guesthouses and similar establishments in the Yunnan and Guangxi areas. Eventually, the investigators received a tip from a hotel attendant on 27 October, in which the man claimed to have seen Qian boarding a minibus bound from Luxi City to Qujing. A team of police officers was dispatched to intercept the vehicle, resulting in the swift of arrest and extradition of Qian to the nearest police station. During the subsequent interrogation, when he was pressed for a motive, he stated that he wanted to take revenge on the society which he claimed had failed him, saying that he was alone in this world, as well as the fact that never wanted to go back to jail ever again. Due to the severity of his crimes, Qian was quickly tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. When his verdict was read out in the court, he said that he felt no remorse for what he had done and said the following: "I killed people everywhere just to be shot. I don't care at all." Soon after, Qian would be executed, but his exact date of execution is unknown.  See also List of serial killers in China   == References ==

Steven Howard Spewak (1951 – March 26, 2004) was an American management consultant, author, and lecturer on enterprise architectures, known for the development of Enterprise Architecture Planning (EAP).  Biography Born in Philadelphia, Spewak earned both his B.A. and his M.A. degree at Case Western Reserve University, and earned his Ph.D. in business administration at the University of Michigan in 1981 with the thesis "Analysis of dynamics of the logical design of information systems". Early 1980s Spewak started his career in industry. In 1986 he became software editor at Continental Insurance, where he headed a data modeling project. Early 1990s he started his management consultant practice with offices in Princeton, N.J., and Washington. He worked with government agencies, and national and international organizations, and was a frequent lecturer on enterprise architecture planning. Spewak has been the Chief Technical Editor of the "Data Resource Management Journal" and "Database Management Information Service". He died on 26 April 2004 in Alexandria VA, at the age of 53.  Work Enterprise Architecture Planning In his 1992 book Enterprise Architecture Planning (EAP), Spewak defined Enterprise Architecture Planning as "the process of defining architectures for the use of information in support of the business and the plan for implementing those architectures". Enterprise Architecture Planning is based on the Business Systems Planning (BSP) approach developed by John Zachman in the 1980. It takes a business-oriented approach to architecture planning to provide:  data quality, access to data, adaptability to changing requirements, data interoperability and sharing, and cost containment. The ultimate goal of an Enterprise Architecture is to define practical and implementable application and technology projects along with those projects required to prepare the organization for its future IT environment. This view counters the more traditional view that applications should be defined before data needs are determined or provided for. Spewak’s approach to Enterprise Architecture Planning is similar to that taken by DOE in that the business mission is the primary driver. That is followed by the data required to satisfy the mission, followed by the applications that are built using that data, and finally by the technology to implement the applications. This hierarchy of activity is represented in the figure on the right, in which the layers are implemented in order, from top to bottom. His approach to Federal Enterprise Architecture has helped organizations with modeling, business strategy planning, process improvement, data warehousing, and various support systems designs, data administration standards, object-oriented and information engineering methodologies, and project management. The Enterprise Architecture Planning (EAP) methodology is beneficial to understanding the further definition of the Federal Enterprise Architecture.  Enterprise Architects, Inc. Spewak was founding partner of Enterprise Architects, Inc. Along with two partners, Frank Digaetano and Stephan DeVocht he tutored several generations of Enterprise Architects, and performed many consulting assignments for Fortune 500 clients, US and Canadian Federal Government organizations, as well as State, Local and Tribal government bodies. Since the publication of his seminal book, he and his partners introduced enhancements to the EAP methodology such as updates for technology architecture, expansion of implementation requirements, and methods for calculating planning project duration and effort. They also developed a planning tool (EAP Toolset Templates), and the StratTac Group LLC Planning Templates, to assist organizations EAP efforts.

The 2021–22 Munster Rugby season was Munster's twenty-first season competing in the United Rugby Championship, alongside which they also competed in the European Rugby Champions Cup. It was Johann van Graan's fifth and final season as head coach.  Events The big news in terms of player movements ahead of the 2021–22 season was the retirement of three club stalwarts: Billy Holland, CJ Stander and Tommy O'Donnell, and the return to the province of the club's record try scorer Simon Zebo after three seasons with French club Racing 92. Fly-half JJ Hanrahan left the province to join French club Clermont, whilst winger Alex Wootton departed to join Connacht on a permanent basis, having spent the previous season on loan at the western province. Scrum-half Nick McCarthy left to re-join his native province Leinster, whilst prop James Cronin joined French club Biarritz, who had recently been promoted to the Top 14, and hooker Rhys Marshall was released by the province and returned to New Zealand, where he joined North Harbour. Centre Alex McHenry joined English club Wasps on loan in October 2021, and new signing Declan Moore joined Ulster as short-term injury cover in late December 2021 and on loan in February 2022. Nine academy players were promoted to the senior squad: Thomas Ahern, Jack Crowley, Jack Daly, Jake Flannery, James French, Seán French, Ben Healy, John Hodnett and Josh Wycherley. South African lock Jason Jenkins joined the senior squad from Japanese club Toyota Verblitz, scrum-half Rowan Osborne joined from Leinster, and hooker Declan Moore, who was on the books with Australian Super Rugby side Melbourne Rebels, joined for the season. Shannon scrum-half Aran Hehir joined the senior squad in late February 2022 to provide cover whilst Craig Casey, Ethan Coughlan and Conor Murray were away on international duty and Rowan Osborne was injured. In coaching news, former Munster assistant coach Ian Costello returned to the province to become their academy manager, having spent the previous five seasons working in England as head coach of RFU Championship club Nottingham and, since 2018, defence coach at Premiership club Wasps. Sports psychologist Caroline Currid, renowned in Ireland for her work with the Limerick hurlers who won back-to-back All-Ireland's in 2020 and 2021, joined the province's backroom team in a part-time role. Three players joined year one of the academy: prop Mark Donnelly, back-row Daniel Okeke and scrum-half Ethan Coughlan, whilst Leinster academy scrum-half Paddy Patterson, who spent part of the previous season on a short-term contract with Munster, joined year three of the academy. Three additional players joined the academy in November 2021: lock Edwin Edogbo, fly-half Tony Butler and back-three Patrick Campbell. With the four South African Super Rugby teams - the Bulls, the Lions, the Sharks and the Stormers - joining the league ahead of the 2021–22 season, the Pro14 was rebranded and restructured as the United Rugby Championship. The teams were divided into regional pools, with Munster joining their provincial rivals Connacht, Leinster and Ulster in the Irish pool. The regular season took place over 18 rounds; Munster played their pool opponents home and away, and played home or away fixtures against the other 12 teams in the league. All sixteen teams were ranked in one league table after the 18 rounds, with the top 8 teams qualifying for the quarter-finals, followed by semi-finals and a grand final. Eight teams qualified from the United Rugby Championship for the Champions Cup. The highest ranked team from each pool qualified for the Champions Cup, with the remaining four qualification spots going to the next four highest-ranked teams in the single league table who have not already qualified from their pool. Subject to approvals, the South African teams will be eligible for the Champions & Challenge Cup. The province was drawn in pool B for the 2021–22 European Rugby Champions Cup pool stage, and faced French club Castres, whom Munster have met in nine previous Champions Cup seasons in a record 16 fixtures, and English club Wasps, who defeated Munster in a classic semi-final in the old Lansdowne Road in 2004, and whom the province last met during the 2007–08 tournament, which Munster went on to win. Munster opened their 2021–22 United Rugby Championship campaign with a bonus-point 42–17 win against the Sharks, one of the four new South African teams, on 25 September 2021. Simon Zebo, making his return for the province, scored two tries, extending his club record to 62, with Gavin Coombes continuing his try-scoring exploits from the previous season with two tries of his own. Chris Cloete and player of the match Craig Casey also crossed the try line. Fly-half Joey Carbery scored seven points off the kicking tee, with his replacement Ben Healy contributing five points off the tee in the second-half. RG Snyman made his eagerly-awaited return from long-term injury as a second-half replacement, and scrum-half Rowan Osborne made his competitive debut for the province, in a match that saw fans return to Thomond Park for the first time since February 2020. Munster were in South Africa for rounds 6 and 7 of the United Rugby Championship, in which they were due to play the Bulls and the Lions, however, the emergence of the omicron variant of COVID-19 led to travel restrictions being implemented by UK and EU authorities, meaning the fixtures had to be postponed. 34 players and staff arrived back in Ireland on 1 December 2021 and immediately entered 10 days of mandatory self-isolation. 14 players and staff who had tested positive for COVID-19 had to remain in South Africa. In the wake of this disruption for Munster and other clubs, and with Munster's opening Champions Cup fixture away to Wasps falling on 12 December, the EPCR extended the deadline for registering players for the tournament to 8 December, meaning Munster could look to supplement their squad with short-term signings, and 22 players were subsequently registered with the province's Champions Cup squad. A depleted Munster squad made up of internationals who'd been away with Ireland during the Autumn tests, academy players and members of the national and provincial talent squads travelled over to England to face Wasps on their opening Champions Cup fixture on 12 December 2021. The team, which featured 12 debutantes, pulled off one of the great Munster away victories, defeating their opponents 35–14 in a thrilling contest in front of a large contingent of Munster fans who had made the journey to Coventry. Munster made it back-to-back wins in the Champions Cup with a gritty 19–13 win at home against French club Castres on 18 December 2021, with a 58th minute try from number 8 Jack O'Donoghue and 14 points off the tee from fly-half Ben Healy being enough for the province to see off their opposition. Following the 10–8 defeat away to Connacht on 1 January 2022, the province received criticism for its style of play, or lack thereof, aimed in particular at head coach Johann van Graan, who had recently confirmed his departure from the province at the end of the season. Critics also pointed to the poor performance in defeat against the Ospreys back in October 2021, prior to the COVID-19 issues the province faced in South Africa and the first two rounds of the Champions Cup, and also to the dour win against Castres in round two of the Champions Cup. Former captain Donal Lenihan, writing in the Irish Examiner, said: "If Munster continue in the vein of the last two limp attacking efforts against Castres and Connacht, then you can forget about any prospect of breaking the trophy drought for another season,", whilst club legend Alan Quinlan described the performance against Connacht as "dreadful", before adding; "Look, you have to acknowledge there has been a lot of good in the last few years, I do want to say that.". Eddie O'Sullivan, former Ireland coach and Munster player, added: "If you want a cameo to show people how Munster have not developed in attack, show them the last five minutes of that first half against Connacht.". Keith Wood, another former Munster player and an Ireland legend, was similarly critical of the province, describing the display against Connacht as "turgid nonsense", adding "There's no point in talking about Munster's attack, that doesn’t exist at the present moment in time. I think we're beginning to ruin some of the players. I'm finding it incredibly hard to watch." Munster forwards coach Graham Rowntree, speaking to the media ahead of the province's fixture against Ulster the following week, described the performance as "more than disappointing" and "very frustrating", but added that a series of clear-the-air meetings had been held, saying "It can only be good to get it all out on the table and clear the air and people air some things.". In the reverse fixture against Castres in round 3 of the Champions Cup on 14 January 2022, Munster earned a 16–13 away win thanks to a 77th minute try from Gavin Coombes, converted by rookie fly-half Jack Crowley, who was faultless off the kicking tee in his first European start for the province. The win secured a place in the knockout stage of the tournament for Munster. Nine days later, Munster followed up their away win against Castres with a 45–7 home win against Wasps, with the tries coming from Jeremy Loughman, Conor Murray, Jack O'Donoghue, who was player of the match on the occasion of his 150th cap for Munster, Rory Scannell and Simon Zebo, who scored a brace to become Munster's all-time leading try-scorer in the Champions Cup and the leading Irish try-scorer in the competition overall. Fly-half Ben Healy and his replacement on the day, Jack Crowley, were both 100% from the kicking tee, with Healy scoring four conversions and a penalty, and Crowley adding two late conversions. The win secured home advantage for Munster in the second leg of the round of 16. Munster faced English club Exeter Chiefs in the round of 16, and lost the first leg of the tie 13–8 away to the Premiership club on 9 April 2022. Exeter took a 10–0 lead in to half-time after tries from Stuart Hogg and Jacques Vermeulen, before Munster fly-half Ben Healy hit back with a penalty to reduce the home sides lead. Hogg responded for Exeter with a drop-goal, but a 66th minute try from Shane Daly brought Munster back within touching distance on the scoreboard, and Exeter had to withstand some intense offensive play from Munster going into the final ten minutes, with replacement scrum-half Craig Casey almost drawing the scores level, before the hosts themselves assaulted the Munster try-line in the last minutes of the match in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to extend their lead. Needing to overturn a five-point deficit to advance in the competition, Munster welcomed Exeter to Thomond Park for the second leg of their last 16 tie one week later. Fly-half Joey Carbery, returning from injury, opened the scoring for the hosts with a penalty, but the visitors responded with their first try of the game to take an early 5–3 lead, before Carbery struck back for Munster with a try of his own, to which he added a second penalty to give Munster a 13–5 half-time lead. Exeter struck first in the second-half with a try in the 47th minute, but Carbery kept Munster in front with two further penalties, before centre Damian de Allende scored a 74th minute try to secure a 26–10 home win for Munster and a 34–23 victory on aggregate, ensuring Munster progressed to a record 19th Champions Cup quarter-final. Facing defending champions Toulouse, who knocked the province out of the previous season's tournament, in the quarter-final, Munster began strongly with an 11th minute Alex Kendellen try, converted by Joey Carbery to lead 7–0, but Romain Ntamack hit back for Toulouse two minutes later with a try of his own, converted by Thomas Ramos, to level the scores. The visitors were dominating the scrum and scored their second try in the 25th minute when Matthis Lebel touched down, with Ramos again converting to give Toulouse a 14–7 lead. However, Munster struck back with a Keith Earls try just before half-time which Carbery converted to leave the scores level heading into the break. The home side came out firing in the second-half, with Mike Haley scoring a 43rd minute try, again converted by Carbery, to give Munster a 21–14 lead, which Carbery extended with a penalty in the 56th minute, but Toulouse responded with Lebel's second try in the 66th minute which, when converted by Ramos, reduced the margin to just three points heading into the final ten minutes. A 75th-minute penalty from Ramos levelled the scores at 24–24, and that remained the score at full-time after Ben Healy missed with a 56-metre penalty attempt in the final minute of normal time. With the scores level at full-time and as both teams scored three tries, extra time ensued, played over two ten-minute halves, but even after that the two teams could not be separated after three missed drop goals between the two, and the game went to a penalty shootout. Munster went first and Conor Murray scored his penalty. Antoine Dupont responded successfully for Toulouse, but Ben Healy missed his first attempt, and when Thomas Ramos scored his penalty, it was advantage Toulouse. Carbery scored his penalty, but Romain Ntamack scored his own to restore Toulouse's lead. Murray missed with his second attempt, whilst Dupont was successful with his own to give Toulouse a 4–2 lead, meaning Healy had to score with his second attempt to give Munster any hope, but he was unable to do so, and Toulouse advanced to the semi-finals, knocking Munster out of the competition for the second season in a row. A 35–25 defeat away to Leinster in round 18 of the 2021–22 United Rugby Championship meant that Munster finished sixth in the league overall, and third in the Irish Shield, and the province headed north to face Ulster in the quarter-finals on 3 June 2022, but Munster lost 36–17 to bring the curtain down on their 2021–22 season, as well as Johann van Graan's tenure as head coach.

Essure was a device for female sterilization. It is a metal coil which when placed into each fallopian tube induces fibrosis and blockage. Essure was designed as an alternative to tubal ligation. However, it was recalled by Bayer in 2018, and the device is no longer sold due to complications secondary to its implantation. The company has reported that several patients implanted with the Essure System for Permanent Birth Control have experienced and/or reported adverse effects, including: perforation of the uterus and/or fallopian tubes, identification of inserts in the abdominal or pelvic cavity, persistent pain, and suspected allergic or hypersensitivity reaction.  Although designed to remain in place for a lifetime, it was approved based on short-term safety studies. Of the 745 women with implants in the original premarket studies, 92% were followed up at one year, and 25% for two years, for safety outcomes. A 2009 review concluded that Essure appeared safe and effective based on short-term studies, that it was less invasive and could be cheaper than laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation. About 750,000 women have received the device worldwide. Initial trials found about 4% of women had tubal perforation, expulsion, or misplacement of the device at the time of the procedure. Since 2013, the product has been controversial, with thousands of women reporting severe side effects leading to surgical extraction. Rates of repeat surgery in the first year were ten times greater with Essure than with tubal ligation. Campaigner Erin Brockovich has been hosting a website where women can share their stories after having the procedure. As of 2015 many adverse events, including tubal perforations, intractable pain and bleeding leading to hysterectomies, possible device-related deaths, and hundreds of unintended pregnancies occurred, according to the US FDA adverse events database and other studies. It was developed by Conceptus Inc. and approved for use in the United States in 2002. Conceptus was acquired by Bayer AG of Germany in June 2013. In 2017, the CE marking in the European Union, and thus the commercial license for Essure was suspended for at least three months. Authorities in France and Ukraine recalled the implants, and the manufacturer withdrew the product voluntarily in Canada, the UK, Finland, and the Netherlands. In April 2018, the FDA restricted sale and use of Essure which resulted in a 70% decrease in sales. In July 2018 Bayer announced the halt of sales in the U.S. by the end of 2018. The device is featured in the 2018 Netflix documentary The Bleeding Edge.  Use A 2015 review found the effectiveness of Essure is unclear due to the low quality of evidence. With perfect use another review found evidence of a 99.8% effective based on 5 years of follow-up. The reported insertional failure rates are "failure to place 2 inserts in the first procedure (5%), initial tubal patency (3.5%), expulsion (2.2%), perforation (1.8%), or other unsatisfactory device location (0.6%)". Upon follow-up, occlusion was observed to have occurred in 96.5% of patients at 3 months with the remainder occluded by 6 months. A 2015 study published in the BMJ concluded that Essure was as efficacious as laparoscopic sterilization at preventing pregnancy, but with a "10-fold higher risk of undergoing re-operation" when compared to patients who underwent a laparoscopic sterilization procedure.  Follow-up For the Essure method, three months after insertion a radiologist is supposed to perform a fluoroscopic procedure called a hysterosalpingogram, to confirm that the fallopian tubes are completely blocked and that the woman can rely on the Essure inserts for birth control. A contrast agent (dye) is injected through the cervix, and an x-ray technologist takes photos of the Essure coils to ensure no contrast leaks past the Essure.  Adverse effects Serious side effects may include persistent pain, perforation of the uterus and fallopian tubes, and migration of the coils into the pelvis or abdomen. Because of the stainless steel medical staff need to be notified before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed. However, the inserts were found to be safe with MRI using a 3-Tesla magnet and is considered MR-conditional.  Risks Procedural complications Inability to place inserts (4%) Cramping (30%) Pain (13%) Nausea/vomiting (11%) Dizziness/light headed (9%) Bleeding/spotting (7%) Vasovagal response (fainting) (1.3%) Perforation, expulsion, or other unsatisfactory location of the insert  Long-term complications Sources:  Abdominal pain (3.8%) Back pain (9%) Menstrual cramps, severe (2.9%) Pelvic or lower abdominal pain, severe (2.5%) Gas/bloating (1.3%) Headache (2.5%) Heavier menstrual bleeding (1.9%) Vaginal discharge or infection (1.5%) Pregnancy  (0.48%) and increased risk of ectopic pregnancy Allergic reaction to the materials Rash Autoimmune disease (0.99%) Weight changes Depression Hair loss Suicide attempt (0.55%)  Procedure A physician places the coils into the fallopian tubes by a catheter passed from the vagina through the cervix and uterus. This occurs successfully between 63% and 100% of the time. Once in place, the ingrowth continues over a period of three months, resulting in blockage in the Fallopian tubes; the tissue barrier formed is supposed to prevent sperm from reaching an egg. During that intervening three-month period, women are advised to use an alternate contraceptive method. Unlike tubal ligation, it may not require a general anaesthetic (though is often done under general anaesthetic). Despite this, some women have reported considerable pain during the procedure.  In one 2007 prospective study, the mean time for procedure was 6.8 minutes (range = 5–18 minutes) for a trained physician to perform. The procedure can be performed in a physician's office. The procedure is reported to be permanent and not reversible by the manufacturer. Nevertheless, several Essure reversals have been performed.  Device The small, flexible inserts are made from polyester fibers, nickel-titanium, stainless steel and solder. The insert contains inner polyethylene terephthalate fibers to induce inflammation, causing a benign fibrotic ingrowth, and is held in place by flexible stainless steel inner coil and a dynamic outer nickel titanium alloy coil. Unlike temporary methods of birth control, the Essure inserts do not contain or release hormones. The inserts do not prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections.  Regulatory history A Facebook group called Essure Problems which had 33,140 members (as of 04/03/2017) called the method "E-hell" and mentioned mostly pain, bleeding, bloating and other side effects from the device. Some women had coils break and perforate their internal organs, or conceived and gave birth to a child, at a number well above what Bayer has been reporting. Erin Brockovich became involved in the controversy and hosts a website where women can share their stories after having the procedure. Since then Bayer provided two toll-free telephone numbers for patient complaints, has advised that women reporting adverse effects are "consistent with clinical trials and consistent with what the FDA is seeing", and further insisted that it wanted to hear from any women experiencing problems with Essure. In April 2015, a group of six delegates from the Essure Problems group, including a doctor with Essure experience, spoke before 36 members of the FDA and the Congressional HELP committee regarding a citizen's petition filed with the FDA. The FDA began investigating the claims of then over 16,000 members of the group as well as the legalities of the approval process that Essure went through. As of 2015, one postmarketing study was not published for 13 years after the device was approved, and another postmarketing study had not been published as of 2015.  FDA The product was approved by the FDA in 2002. In 2013, the product made news in North America, with women complaining of severe side effects leading to surgical extraction. According to one article, women who have gotten pregnant are naming these children e-babies. In October 2013, the FDA stated that since the product was approved in 2002 it had received 943 reports of adverse events related to Essure, mainly for pain (606 of the complaints). An additional 1,000 more complaints have been sent to the FDA in a voluntary reporting system, but physicians are not obliged to report complaints. In June 2015, the FDA reported an investigation into Essure and its over 5000 complaints, seven reported deaths, and many additional side effects, all linked to Essure, its specific chemical composition, its improper placement and its insertion. The agency announced that its Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel would conduct an evidence-based review of Essure's safety in September 2015 due to the rise in adverse event reports from only 950 reports between 2002 through October 2013, to more than 4,150, or 81 percent of the total, from October 2013 to June 2015. In February 2016, the FDA issued a "black box" label to warn the public about the harmful complications associated with the use of this device and requested Bayer to conduct a new postmarket surveillance to follow 2,000 women for at least three years, comparing the effectiveness and safety of the device with other surgical contraceptive methods. Women and doctors were required to sign a decision checklist before Essure implantation, and to give consent to a test three months later to ensure the device was properly placed and functioning. In July 2020, Bayer published interim data from the FDA-mandated postmarket surveillance study comparing patients who received Essure to those who receiving a laparoscopic tubal ligation. The interim data reported the incidence of several side effects in each group. In Essure patients, chronic lower abdominal or pelvic pain occurred in 9% and abnormal bleeding in 16%, compared to 4.5% reporting pain and 10% with abnormal bleeding in the tubal ligation group. It also reported new allergic or hypersensitivity reactions in 22% of patients and no reports of new autoimmune disorders, although blinded independent verification was pending. Recruitment of patients receiving Essure into the postmarket surveillance study has ceased as the device is no longer available on the US market.  Legal Issues In 2023, the device was the subject of a class action lawsuit in Australia. Over 1000 women joined the suit claiming that the device caused pain, suffering, and significant bleeding.

KTXH (channel 20), branded on-air as My20 Vision, is a television station in Houston, Texas, United States, serving as the local outlet for the MyNetworkTV programming service. It is owned and operated by Fox Television Stations alongside Fox outlet KRIV (channel 26). The two stations share studios on Southwest Freeway (I-69/US 59) in Houston; KTXH's transmitter is located near Missouri City, Texas. KTXH began broadcasting in November 1982 as Houston's third independent station. A month after going on air, its broadcast tower collapsed in a construction accident that killed five people. The station recovered and emerged as Houston's sports independent, beginning long associations with the Houston Astros and Houston Rockets that continued uninterrupted through the late 1990s and sporadically until the early 2010s. Not long after starting up, KTXH was sold twice in rapid succession for large amounts. However, when the independent station trade, advertising market, and regional economy cooled, it was sold again for less than half of its previous value. The Paramount Stations Group acquired KTXH and other stations in two parts between 1989 and 1991, bringing much-needed stability. KTXH was one of several Paramount-owned stations to be charter outlets for the United Paramount Network (UPN) in 1995; in 2001, after UPN was acquired by CBS, Fox took possession of the station in a trade and merged its operations with KRIV. When UPN merged into The CW in 2006, bypassing all of Fox's UPN and independent stations in the process, the station became part of Fox's MyNetworkTV service. In 2021, the station became one of two ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) transmitters for the Houston area; its subchannels are now transmitted by other local stations on its behalf.  History Construction, start-up, and tragedy Interest in channel 20 in Houston began to emerge in 1976, as three groups filed applications for new television stations in light of the emerging technology of subscription television (STV). These were Channel 20 Houston, Inc., a group led by Robert S. Block of Milwaukee; Channel 20, Inc., headed by Sidney Shlenker; and CPI Subscription TV, subsidiary of cable television company Communications Properties, Inc. CPI withdrew, and a settlement application between the Block and Shlenker consortia—Channel 20, Inc.—was granted the construction permit by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on May 19, 1980. It was the second joint settlement between Block and Shlenker for a Texas station; the Shlenker consortium, with Milt Grant as head of operations, had previously received the construction permit for KTXA in Fort Worth in March. That station began broadcasting in February 1981 as a hybrid operation, with commercial programming and ON TV, the STV service owned by Oak Industries. Oak was to own a majority stake in the local ON TV operation. Channel 20's launch was delayed due to holdups in determining the local structure of the ON TV franchise and a dispute involving the mineral rights under the new Senior Road Tower, a 1,971-foot (601 m) mast in Fort Bend County that would be used to transmit KTXH and nine Houston FM radio stations. KTXH began broadcasting on November 7, 1982, branding on-air as "20-Vision" and broadcasting from studios at 8950 Kirby Drive in Houston. By that time, though, Oak had frozen its plans into eventual cancellation, with Grant telling Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle that their operation had shut down completely. This was to the benefit of KTXH's ad-supported commercial offerings, giving it prime time hours to program (particularly with sports) and making reticent cable systems more willing to put the new station on their lineups. On opening night, the station showed the film The Deer Hunter, and five nights later, the station aired its first Houston Rockets basketball game; Shlenker was a 10 percent stakeholder in the NBA team. The 30 games the Rockets were slated to telecast in 1982–83 marked a record for the club. Shortly before signing on, the Houston Sports Association, owner of the Houston Astros baseball club, became a new 38-percent stockholder in KTXH, bringing with them television rights to the Astros. In the first month on air, Houston's third independent station claimed eight percent of the viewing audience in the Houston metropolitan area, immediately moving into a tie for the lead, with its program lineup organized into thematic blocks. KTXH was the first tenant to use the Senior Road Tower. A month later, work began to install the antenna that the FM radio stations would use on the mast. The first part was put into place on December 6. Despite winds, work proceeded the next morning, December 7. A failure in a clamping device on the hoisting mechanism caused a 75-foot (23 m) section of antenna to fall off, severing a guy wire and leading to the tower's collapse. Five people, all tower workers employed by a New Jersey company, died. KTXH suffered a $1.5 million loss in equipment, including the transmitter, on which the falling mast collapsed. A man in the transmitter building saw the tower collapse and fled. In the wake of the tower collapse, KTXH was out of service for a total of 61 days. The station filed a $42 million lawsuit, alleging negligent construction and claiming a $7 million loss in equipment and advertising. It also immediately ordered a new transmitter as the Senior Road Tower consortium moved ahead with reconstruction of the mast, where KTXH would return upon its completion in October 1983. Even while broadcasting from a temporary facility atop the Allied Bank Plaza, KTXH continued to post competitive numbers against KRIV.  An ownership revolving door The pairing of KTXA and KTXH had proven to be successful and highly lucrative. Grant's aggressive programming and promotions strategy, plus a favorable climate for independent stations nationally, made the two stations highly profitable and attracted major bidders. Outlet Communications, the broadcasting division of The Outlet Company of Rhode Island, was one of several parties negotiating to buy KTXA and KTXH. However, negotiations fell through, and Grant instead sold the pair to the Gulf Broadcast Group for $158 million in May 1984. The sale was held up for several months at the FCC, which conditioned the purchase on Gulf divesting FM stations in both cities. The sale price was considered unprecedented given the short period of operation of the stations. Gulf had scarcely owned the stations when it sold its entire stations group for $755 million to Taft Broadcasting in 1985. Taft doubled the size of the KTXH facility to include a second studio and more office space. Over the course of late 1985 and late 1986, Taft was fending off overtures from activist investor Robert Bass, who was amassing shares in the company. Meanwhile, in addition to a worsening regional economy, the independent television market nationally was softening; the two Texas stations were believed to be the weakest in the Taft chain, even as KTXH boasted the highest audience share of any independent station in a top-35 market built since 1981. On Rockets telecasts during this time, a young Hannah Storm hosted pregame and postgame shows. Taft put its broadcast group up for sale in August 1986 due to agitation by Bass. While it asked $500 million for five independent stations, the winning bidder—TVX Broadcast Group—only paid $240 million, and Taft estimated its after-tax loss for the sale at $45 to $50 million.  TVX implemented budget cuts, laying off about 15 percent of the staff at the acquisitions, and renegotiated programming costs; KTXH's production unit was completely disbanded. The Taft stations purchase left TVX highly leveraged and vulnerable. TVX's bankers, Salomon Brothers, provided the financing for the acquisition and in return held more than 60 percent of the company. The company was to pay Salomon Brothers $200 million on January 1, 1988, and missed the first payment deadline, having been unable to lure investors to its junk bonds even before Black Monday. While TVX recapitalized by the end of 1988, Salomon Brothers reached an agreement in principle in January 1989 for Paramount Pictures to acquire options to purchase the investment firm's majority stake. This deal was replaced in September with an outright purchase of 79 percent of TVX for $110 million.  Paramount ownership and UPN affiliation In 1991, Paramount acquired the remainder of TVX. The deal gave Paramount a strategic entrance into the television stations market; three years later, Paramount merged with Viacom, and the following year, KTXH became one of the charter outlets of the United Paramount Network (UPN). In 1996, Viacom purchased a 50 percent ownership interest in UPN. KTXH's relationship with the Rockets continued until the 1997–1998 season, when KHTV (channel 39) outbid channel 20 for the rights to the team's road games. The move was largely precipitated by what was believed to be a reluctance to commit to sports preemptions of UPN programming. KHTV, which became KHWB in 1999, cited its affiliation with The WB when it dropped the team after three years; after a disastrous start to the 2000–2001 season on new independent KTBU, plagued by low ratings and signal coverage issues in parts of the Houston metropolitan area, the Rockets moved their games back to KTXH, with some Houston Comets women's basketball telecasts appearing on the station. At the same time, the Astros—which aired 64 games in the 1997 campaign on channel 20—left for independent station KNWS-TV (channel 51), with KTXH's increasing obligations to UPN as a core factor. In both cases, ratings fell after the teams moved their games off KTXH.  Sale to Fox; conversion to MyNetworkTV In 2000, Viacom purchased CBS. On August 12 of that year, United Television—the United in UPN—sold its UPN stations to the Fox Television Stations subsidiary of News Corporation for $5.5 billion; the deal was finalized on July 31, 2001. As part of its acquisition of the United stations, Fox had purchased KBHK-TV in San Francisco, a city in which Fox did not own its affiliate—but there was a CBS owned-and-operated station. Similarly, Viacom now owned UPN stations in Houston (KTXH) and Washington, D.C. (WDCA), markets where it did not own the CBS affiliate but where there was a Fox owned-and-operated station. As a result, Fox traded KBHK-TV to Viacom in exchange for KTXH and WDCA, resulting in three new duopolies, including new Fox duopolies in Houston and Washington. The FCC approved the deal in August 2001 on the condition that Viacom sell one of its San Francisco radio stations. KTXH vacated the Kirby Drive facilities and consolidated with KRIV at its Southwest Freeway facility; the move led to some job losses. The Rockets departed KTXH in 2002 for a new agreement with KNWS-TV and KHWB. On January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation (which had been created as a result of the split of Viacom at the start of the year) announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks' respective programming to create a new "fifth" network called The CW. In unveiling the merged network, while WB and UPN affiliates owned by WB minority stakeholder Tribune Broadcasting (including KHWB in Houston) and by CBS Television Stations were announced as charter outlets, none of the Fox-owned UPN stations—many of which were competitors to these stations—were chosen. The next month, News Corporation then announced the creation of its own secondary network, MyNetworkTV, to serve its own outgoing UPN stations as well as those that had not been selected for The CW. Even past the MyNetworkTV switch, KTXH continued its association with local sports. In late 2007 and early 2008, the Rockets and Astros returned to KTXH with a reduced schedule of games, largely in a complementary role to Fox Sports Houston, the Fox-owned regional sports network (RSN). The Astros aired all of their games on Fox Sports Houston in 2011, which was to be their last season on the RSN as the two teams prepared to launch Comcast SportsNet Houston (now Space City Home Network) in 2012.  Technical information In 1999, KTXH began broadcasting a digital signal, which was not broadcast from the Senior Road tower but at a new, purpose-built mast in the same area. KTXH discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 20, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television; the station's digital signal continued on UHF channel 19, using virtual channel 20. On December 7, 2021, KTXH became one of two ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) transmitters for the Houston area as part of a deployment involving 10 stations in the market.  Subchannels The station's ATSC 1.0 subchannels are carried on the multiplexed signals of other Houston TV stations:  ATSC 3.0 lighthouse service See also Fox Sports Houston (now defunct) KRIV  References External links Official website

Shotesham () is a village in South Norfolk which lies approximately 5 miles south of Norwich. It sits next to Stoke Holy Cross and Saxlingham Nethergate in the valley of the River Tas. It covers an area of 14.50 km2 (5.60 sq mi) and had a population of 539 in 210 households at the 2001 census, increasing to 562 in 227 households at the 2011 census. Shotesham was for many years the Norfolk seat of the D'Oyly family and of the D'Oyly baronets 'of Shottisham', Norfolk (not to be confused with Shottisham, Suffolk), who also possessed estates in Suffolk. The country house and estate of Shotesham Park, designed by Sir John Soane, is the seat of the Fellowes family.  Churches Four churches were once to be found here: two are intact and two are ruins:  All Saints’ The present parish church stands in the centre of the village, and is from two distinct periods. It has a medieval tower and nave, with a chancel from the early 20th century.  St Mary's On the other side of the valley from All Saints, about a mile away, is this church, which had a Victorian restoration, next to a large farmhouse, and the ruin of St Martins. There is a monthly service.  St Martin's Standing in the shadow of St Mary's, the church has been a ruin for centuries. The narrow nave and chancel survive mostly to head height, with a well-preserved east gable. There are also remains of the south porch.  St Botolph's The area has been cleared and replanted and the ruin consolidated for public viewing.  Notes External links Shotesham Village Website  Media related to Shotesham at Wikimedia Commons

Guide dogs  (colloquially known in the US as seeing-eye dogs) are assistance dogs trained to lead blind or visually impaired people around obstacles. Although dogs can be trained to navigate various obstacles, they are red–green colour blind and incapable of interpreting street signs. The human does the directing, based on skills acquired through previous mobility training. The handler might be likened to an aircraft's navigator, who must know how to get from one place to another, and the dog is the pilot, who gets them there safely. In several countries guide dogs, along with most other service and hearing dogs, are exempt from regulations against the presence of animals in places such as restaurants and public transportation.  History References to service animals date at least as far back as the mid-16th century. The second line of the popular verse alphabet "A was an Archer" is most commonly "B was a Blind-man/Led by a dog". In Elizabeth Barrett Browning's 19th-century verse novel Aurora Leigh, the title character remarks, "The blind man walks wherever the dog pulls / And so I answered." Guide dogs are also mentioned in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol: "Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'" Evidence suggests that dogs may have been used as guides for the visually impaired based on depictions of a blind-man being guided by his dog on the wall of a house in Herculaneum, buried when Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE. This and other visual depictions indicate that dogs have been common companions for the blind for thousands of years. Additional material evidence would be required to positively assess their use specifically as guides. The first service dog training schools were established in Germany during World War I, to enhance the mobility of returning veterans who were blinded in combat. Interest in service animals outside of Germany did not become widespread until Dorothy Harrison Eustis, an American dog breeder living in Switzerland, wrote a first-hand account about a service animal training school in Potsdam, Germany, that was published in The Saturday Evening Post in 1927. That same year, United States Senator Thomas D. Schall of Minnesota was paired with a service animal imported from Germany, who was trained by the owner of LaSalle Kennels, Jack Sinykin of Minnesota. The service animal movement did not take hold in America until Nashville resident Morris Frank returned from Switzerland after being trained with one of Eustis's dogs, a female German shepherd named Buddy. Frank and Buddy embarked on a publicity tour to convince Americans of the abilities of service animals and the need to allow people with service animals access to public transportation, hotels, and other areas open to the public. In 1929, Eustis and Frank co-founded The Seeing Eye school in Nashville, Tennessee (relocated in 1931 to New Jersey). The first service animals in Great Britain were German Shepherds. Four of these first were Flash, Judy, Meta, and Folly, who were handed over to their new owners, veterans blinded in World War I, on 6 October 1931 in Wallasey, Merseyside. Judy's new owner was Musgrave Frankland. In 1934, The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in Great Britain began operation, although their first permanent trainer was a Russian military officer, Captain Nikolai Liakhoff, who moved to the UK in 1933. Elliott S. Humphrey was an animal breeder who trained the first guide dogs for the blind used in the United States. Humphrey was hired to breed German shepherds at a centre in Switzerland that had been set up by Dorothy Harrison Eustis of Philadelphia and began the work that led to the Seeing-Eye Dog program. The first dogs produced at the centre, known as Fortunate Fields, were used for military and police work and for tracking missing persons. Then Humphrey trained German shepherds to guide the blind. The Germans had developed a guide dog program during World War I, but Mr. Humphrey devised different procedures and it is his that are followed in the United States.  Research Important studies on the behaviour and training methods of service animals were done in the 1920s and 1930s by Jakob von Uexküll and Emanuel Georg Sarris. They studied the value of service animals and introduced advanced methods of training. There have also been important studies into the discrimination experienced by people that use service and assistance animals.  Breeds Guide dog breeds are chosen for temperament and trainability. At the moment  Golden Retrievers, Labradors, Standard Poodles, German Shepherds, and Golden Retriever/Labrador crosses are most likely to be chosen by service animal facilities. The most popular breed used globally today is the Labrador Retriever. This breed has a good range of size, is easily kept due to its short coat, is generally healthy and has a gentle but willing temperament. Crosses such as the Goldador (Golden Retriever/Labrador), combine the sensitivity of the Golden Retriever and the tolerance of the Labrador Retriever. Also common are Labradoodles, i.e., Labrador/Poodles, are bred to help reduce allergens as all breeds shed but levels vary. Some schools, such as the Guide Dog Foundation, have added Standard Poodles to their breed registry. Although German Shepherds were once a common breed used for guide work, many schools have discontinued using these dogs due to the skills and unwavering leadership role required by the handler to keep the breed active and non-destructive.  Accessibility Despite regulations or rules that deny access to animals in restaurants and other public places, in many countries, service animals are protected by law and therefore may accompany their handlers most places that are open to the public. Laws and regulations vary worldwide:  In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits any business, government agency, or other organization that provides access to the general public from barring service animals, except where their presence would cause a health or safety risk. However, religious organizations are not required to provide such access. Whether service animals in training have the same rights or not usually falls on each individual state government. Surprisingly, the ADA stipulates the Veterans Hospitals system does not have to follow these laws and can refuse admittance to military vets with service animals. In addition, the Fair Housing Act requires that landlords allow tenants to have service animals, as well as other types of assistance animals, in residences that normally have a No Pets policy and that no extra fees may be charged for such tenants. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity investigates complaints from the public alleging denials of reasonable accommodation requests involving assistance animals. In the United Kingdom the Equality Act 2010 (England, Scotland, Wales) and Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Northern Ireland) provides for people with disabilities to have the same right to services supplied by shops, banks, hotels, libraries, pubs, taxis, and restaurants as everyone else. Service providers have to make "reasonable adjustments" to accommodate assistance dog owners. Under Part 12 of the EA and part 5 of the DDA, it is illegal for assistance dog owners to be refused access to a taxi or minicab with their assistance dog, but medical exemptions are available if drivers have a certificate from their GPs. In most South American countries and Mexico, service animal access depends solely upon the goodwill of the owner or manager. In more tourist-heavy areas, service animals are generally welcomed without problems. In Brazil, however, a 2006 federal decree requires allowance of service animals in all public and open-to-public places. The Federal District Metro has developed a program that trains service animals to ride it. In Malta, the Equal Opportunities Act 2000 (Cap. 413) states that it is illegal to discriminate against a disabled person who needs an assistant, in this case, a service animal. The few exceptions are restaurant kitchens, hospital special wards, toilets and premises where other animals are kept. In Australia, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 protects service animals handlers. Each state and territory has its own laws, which may differ slightly. In Canada, service animals are allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed. Service Animal laws by province: Alberta: Blind Persons' Rights Act, Service Dogs Act British Columbia: Guide Animal Act Manitoba: The Human Rights Code, The Service Animals Protection Act New Brunswick: Human Rights Act Newfoundland & Labrador: Blind Persons' Rights Act, Human Rights Act Northwest Territories: Human Rights Act Nova Scotia: Blind Persons' Rights Act, Human Rights Act Nunavut: Human Rights Act Ontario: Blind Persons' Rights Act, Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, Human Rights Code Prince Edward Island: Human Rights Act Quebec: Individuals with Disabilities Act, Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms Saskatchewan: Human Rights Code Yukon: Human Rights Act In South Korea, it is illegal to deny access to service animals in any areas that are open to the public. Violators are fined no more than 2 million Korean Won. In Portugal, service animals are allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed. The Law - Decreto-Lei n.74/2007 - Establish their rights. In Switzerland, service animals are allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed. In Russia, service animals are allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed. Guide dogs are exempt from the fare charges in public transportation.  Discrimination Since some schools of thought in Islam consider dogs in general to be unclean, Muslim taxi drivers and store owners have sometimes refused to accommodate customers who have service animals, which has led to discrimination charges against them. However, in 2003 the Islamic Sharia Council, a British organization that provides non-binding guidance on interpreting Islamic religious law, ruled that the ban on dogs does not apply to those used for guide work.  Benefits of owning a guide dog Studies show owning a pet or therapy animal offers beneficial effects psychologically, socially, and physiologically, and guide dogs are no exception.  Some blind people report experiencing increased levels of confidence, a greater sense of security, and a cherished friendship from owning guide dogs. Some also state that owning a guide dog has encouraged them to exercise more, especially by walking. This is attributed to a willingness to venture outdoors facilitated by a sense of independence. Some blind people claim meeting others and socializing is easier with a guide dog, and people are more likely to offer assistance when there is a service animal present. The animals may also lead to increased interactions with other people, providing an easy topic of conversation. Guide dogs may be more deliberate than the use of a long cane when leading their handlers in an unfamiliar place. The animal directs the right path, eliminating the trial and error users may experience with a cane. Some report that guide dogs make the experience of the unknown more relaxing. Many blind people using a guide dog report travel is much faster and safer. Owners of guide dogs share a special bond with their animal. Many report that the animal is a member of the family and, often, the handler goes to their animal for comfort and support.  The animal is not seen as a working animal, but more as a loyal friend. However, it is important to remember that guide dogs are working animals and should not be distracted or treated as a pet while they are on duty. People often have misconceptions about guide dogs, including believing they work all the time. In reality, the dogs usually work only when their handler leaves their residence. The handler tells the dog where they want to go, and the dogs are taught intelligent disobedience—blocking the handler from proceeding when there is an unsafe situation.

Chang Jong-hoon (born April 10, 1968) is a retired former infielder in the KBO League. He spent his entire 20-year career with Binggrae/Hanwha Eagles. He is currently a coach with the team. Chang was a two-time KBO MVP, and led the league in home runs and RBI three seasons in a row, from 1990 to 1992. He was the first player in the KBO League to reach 40 home runs in a season, the first to score 100 or more runs, and the first to drive in 100 or more runs. Chang was the KBO career Home Run King for ten years until being surpassed by Yang Joon-hyuk. Chang's 340 career home runs currently rank fourth on the KBO all-time list; his 1,145 RBI rank seventh.  Career Chang entered the league as a shortstop, winning the KBO League Golden Glove Award twice at that position, in 1988 and 1990. In 1990, he blasted 28 home runs and had 91 RBI. Chang won the KBO League Most Valuable Player Award in both 1991 and 1992. In 1991 he hit .345 with 104 runs scored, 35 home runs, and 114 RBI to go along with an OPS of 1.090. He won the Golden Glove Award again, this time from the designated hitter position. That year he became the first KBO player to score 100 or more runs, as well as becoming the first player to drive in 100 or more runs. Switching to first base in 1992, he topped the previous year's numbers when he .299 with 41 home runs and 119 RBI and an OPS of 1.105, winning his fourth Golden Glove. That year he became the first KBO player to hit 40 or more home runs in a season. Chang's final KBO Golden Glove Award came in 1995, when he hit .326 with 22 home runs and 78 RBI, with an OPS of .986. Chang was part of the Eagles' so-called "Dynamite Bats" in the late 1990s to early 2000s, when the team was renowned for its overall slugging percentage, and won the franchise's only KBO championship (in 1999).   Chang hit his 253rd career home run on May 23, 1999, passing Lee Man-soo to become the all-time home run leader in the KBO. His total was later surpassed by Yang Joon-hyuk in 2009. Chang's number 35 jersey was retired by the Eagles on September 16, 2005. Immediately after his retirement as a player, Chang was hired as a coach for the Eagles, a position he held from 2006 to 2014. He moved to the Lotte Giants as a coach from 2015 to 2017. In 2018, Chang returned to the Eagles after being selected by manager Han Yong-duk to help rebuild the team.

SMS V27 was a V25-class torpedo boat of the Imperial German Navy that served during the First World War. The ship was built by AG Vulcan at Stettin in Prussia (now Szczecin in Poland), and was completed in September 1914. The ship was sunk at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916.  Construction and design In 1913, the Imperial German Navy placed orders for 12 high-seas torpedo boats, with six each ordered from AG Vulcan (V25–V30) and Schichau-Werke (S31–S36). While the designs built by each shipyard were broadly similar, they differed from each other in detail, and were significantly larger and more capable than the small torpedo boats built for the German Navy in the last two years. V27 was launched from AG Vulcan's Stettin shipyard on 26 March 1914 and commissioned on 2 September 1914. The "V" in V27 refers to the shipyard at which she was constructed. V27 was 78.5 metres (257 ft 7 in) long overall and 77.8 metres (255 ft 3 in) at the waterline, with a beam of 8.33 metres (27 ft 4 in) and a draft of 3.63 metres (11 ft 11 in). Displacement was 812 tonnes (799 long tons) normal and 975 tonnes (960 long tons) deep load. Three oil-fired water-tube boilers fed steam to 2 sets of AEG-Vulcan steam turbines rated at 23,500 metric horsepower (23,200 shp; 17,300 kW), giving a speed of 33.5 knots (62.0 km/h; 38.6 mph). 225 tonnes (221 long tons) of fuel oil was carried, giving a range of 1,080 nautical miles (2,000 km; 1,240 mi) at 20 knots (37 km/h; 23 mph). Armament consisted of three 8.8 cm SK L/45 naval guns in single mounts, together with six 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes with two fixed single tubes forward and 2 twin mounts aft. Up to 24 mines could be carried. The ship had a complement of 83 officers and men.  Service In October 1914, V27 was listed as part of the 17 half-flotilla of the 9th Torpedo Boat Flotilla. The 17th half-flotilla, including V27, which was under training, was deployed to the Baltic in October 1914 to take part in operations against British submarines. Between 15 and 17 December 1914, V27, as part of the 9th Flotilla, took part in the Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. V27 took part in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915. V27 participated in the Battle of Jutland as part of the 17th Half Flotilla of the 9th Flotilla, in support of the German battlecruisers. The 9th Flotilla, including V27, took part in a torpedo attack on British battlecruisers from about 17:26 CET (16:26 GMT). The attack was disrupted by British destroyers, and V27 was immobilised by two 4-inch (102 mm) shell hits, one of which severed her main steam pipe. Her crew was taken off by V26 which then scuttled V27 with gunfire. Three of V27's crew were wounded.  References Bibliography Campbell, John (1998). Jutland: An Analysis of the Fighting.

Kai Christian Middelthon Holst (24 February 1913 – 27 June 1945) was a Norwegian seaman, fur farmer and resistance fighter during World War II. When the leadership of Milorg was torn up by the Gestapo in 1942, he acquired a leading role in the organisation and participated in re-establishing the central leadership (Sentralledelsen, SL) of Milorg together with Jens Christian Hauge. Holst had to flee Norway in the autumn of 1943 and stayed in Sweden until the liberation of Norway in 1945. Holst is remembered both for his work with the Norwegian resistance and for the circumstances surrounding his death in Stockholm in 1945. Holst's demise was so much talked of at the time that the Milorg leadership issued a statement in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten in July 1945. Swedish and Norwegian authorities officially concluded that Holst committed suicide, but his family and many of his friends and colleagues were of the opinion that Holst was murdered.  Background Kai Holst was born and grew up in the town of Lillehammer. He was the son of businessman Christian Holst and Inga Holst, born Rasmussen, both originally from Stavanger. After elementary school Holst attended secondary school and vocational training in Lillehammer. A couple of years after his confirmation he found work as a seaman, and in the years 1930–1933 he sailed on MS Brageland, owned by the Norwegian shipping company Sydamerikalinjen, then transferred to MS Daghild, owned by the Norwegian shipowner Ditlev-Simonsen. In 1933 he finished working as a seaman and became a fur farmer in Mesnali, east of Lillehammer. Holst contracted tuberculosis and just before the outbreak of World War II he had a major operation related to his pulmonary tuberculosis. From December 1944 until his death he was married to Margarete Corneliussen, daughter of Ragnar Corneliussen, the president of Tiedemann's tobacco factory and a member of the board of Industriforbundet, and Monna Morgenstierne Roll. He was thus brother-in-law to Major General Ole Otto Paus, who was married to his wife's sister Else.  Work with the resistance Clandestine work in Norway After Norway was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany Holst soon, despite his bad health, started working with the main Norwegian resistance organisation, Milorg. He was recruited in 1941 by his brother-in-law, the officer Lars Heyerdahl-Larsen and was soon given important tasks and gained a reputation as the most action-oriented man in the secretariat of the central leadership (Sentralledelsen). From 1942 Holst worked as a courier, established Milorg's system for hiding refugees (apartments where resistance fighters went into hiding before being "exported" to neutral Sweden) and had close contact with such central resistance figures as Ole Borge and Jens Christian Hauge. Kai Holst was, according to professor Tore Pryser, instrumental in teaching Hauge the various skills needed: "In many ways it was actually Holst who trained the inexperienced Hauge." At this time Holst worked closely with Hauge and for half a year they shared an undercover apartment. Holst's girlfriend and wife-to-be cared for the two men and was herself deeply involved in work for the resistance. In his report about his work during the war Jens Christian Hauge was highly approving of "Kaka", as Holst was called informally, and especially recognised him among his colleagues. When Jomar Brun (known for his involvement in Norwegian heavy water production) and his wife had to flee to Sweden, it was Holst who through Milorg's chief of communications, Salve Staubo, organised an undercover apartment in Oslo for the couple. It was also Holst who through Staubo recruited Milorg's legendary chief of weapons, Bror With. Even though he never had any formal executive position in Milorg, Kai Holst had an important role in the practical work in the organisation, and he was especially important for Milorg in the autumn of 1942 when several of the leaders were arrested by the Gestapo or had to flee to Sweden. Holst participated in the meeting at the turn of the year 1942 when Milorg was reorganised with Jens Christian Hauge as Inspector General (known as "big I"). In addition to being the link between the Milorg leadership and its district organisations, Holst was also the link to resistance groups independent of Milorg. They included Oslogjengen with Gunnar Sønsteby, XU, Asbjørn Bryhn' groups, 2A and the Osvald Group (also known as the Sunde Group after its leader Asbjørn Sunde). The cooperation with the communists and their inferior security almost resulted in Holst being caught by the Gestapo. Holst had an important role during the Osvald Group's fire-bombing of the work-service office in Pilestredet in Oslo on 20 March 1943, which Milorg hesitantly agreed to, whose aim was to destroy archives of people assigned to work service for the Nazi regime. In spite of his bad health Holst worked hard and took on several dangerous assignments, among them meetings with people who were suspected of working with the German security services. Holst also organised squads for liquidating dangerous German and collaborationist Norwegian agents. Holst was a skilled undercover operator, fully aware of the risks of being captured, and always carried a gun and a poison pill with him so that if he was caught, he could commit suicide and not reveal information about the organisation.  Escape to Sweden In the summer of 1943 Holst had to flee to neutral Sweden. After hiding at a fur-farm in Mesnali he was accompanied over the border by a border guide at Svinesund on 5 August. He was arrested on entering Sweden and explained that he had to flee as he had been in possession of a radio without permission, had listened to news from London, and had spread it to others. He did not say anything about his work with Milorg. After being questioned by the Swedish authorities in Strömstad, as a refugee from Norway he was sent to Kjesäter and after further questioning there given permission to travel to Stockholm. In Stockholm Holst was employed at the Norwegian legation, working with military office number 4 (Mi4) at an office at Skeppargatan 32 on Östermalm. He worked with supplies to the resistance forces in Norway and one of his tasks was to organise courier activities into and out of Norway. Part of Holst's work for the Norwegian resistance was illegal in neutral Sweden. At least once Holst were arrested by the Swedish police, but was quickly set free. The arrest was connected with a failed attempt by Holst to organise a courier route over Magnor, assisted by a Swede with local connections and another Norwegian. After the war it was revealed that the two were in the service of the German intelligence agency, the Abwehr. Holst was good at organising and acquiring equipment and had many contacts, one of whom was the Soviet ambassador to Sweden, Alexandra Kollontai, from whom he acquired several pistols. In November 1944 Holst was involved in an illegal weapons purchase and received a warning from the Swedish security police, Säpo. Around the same time Holst was mentioned by Säpo in connection with an espionage affair in which the Norwegian intelligence agent Finn Jacobsen was involved. It was however not possible for the Swedish authorities to interrogate Holst as he had diplomatic immunity. Finn Jacobsen was working for the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and cooperated with Holst in supplying the British with intelligence from Norway, without the knowledge of the Norwegian legation in Stockholm, which the SIS did not fully trust. Holst was an activist and probably had sympathy with the action-connected resistance groups, such as 2A and the Osvald Group and the so-called sports office (Idrettskontoret) at the Norwegian legation, led by Harald Gram. Holst married Margarete Corneliussen on 19 December 1944 in Stockholm.  Peace and death After the German capitulation in May 1945, Holst was working on closing the various storage bases that Norwegian resistance fighters had established on Swedish soil, and travelling back and forth between Sweden and Norway. On 23 June, he arrived in Norway by car from Stockholm and early in the morning of 26 June he accompanied British and Norwegian forces in searches carried out at German military camps at the Wehrmacht headquarters in Lillehammer. The same day he unexpectedly travelled back to Stockholm and on the morning of 27 June was found dead at the top of the staircase in an apartment building at Rindögatan 42 on Gärdet. He was found by the porter's wife, shot in the right side of the head, lying in a pool of blood at the top of the staircase, outside the door to the elevator room. Some hours earlier she had found his rucksack and travel bag outside the entrance. The body was found with 1,200 NOK, a large sum at that time (equal to more than 20,000 NOK, or over $3,000 in 2012), something that seemed to rule out robbery as a motive for murdering him. According to the Swedish police Holst had rung the doorbell and had been let in by one of the tenants, but had not then visited that apartment. The policeman who first saw the body reported that the pistol (Holst's own, a Spanish Llama Colt 9mm) was in Holst's right hand, with his finger on the trigger. The gun was removed by the police officer before the criminal police came. There is no photograph or sketch of the body at the site, only photographs from the autopsy. Even though the case was investigated as a possible murder, the Swedish police quickly concluded that it was suicide. The criminal technicians test fired the weapon found in Holst's hand and found that it was the same as the one that fired the bullet found in the staircase where Holst had been found dead. Of the 28 tenants in the building, only three were questioned by the police during the investigation. In addition to limited questioning of possible witnesses, there were several other deficiencies in the investigation; there was no detailed description of the place he was found and information that was routinely collected during murder investigations was not recorded. Kai Christian Middelthon Holst was buried at Vestre gravlund in Oslo. The grave is marked with a simple headstone on which his name, birth and death are carved.  "The Holst Case" Suicide or murder? Holst's family, many of his friends and colleagues in the resistance movement, among them Hans Ringvold and Erik Myhre, held the opinion that Holst was murdered. Among the theories colleagues and friends put forward about a possible murder was liquidation by a foreign intelligence service, be it from Germany, Sweden, the Soviet Union or the US.  Threats Holst's family did their own research regarding his death. Holst's sister, Else Heyerdahl-Larsen, contacted Norwegian authorities, but was warned against looking into the case as it could be dangerous. Ole Otto Paus, then an army captain, later a major general, was married to the sister of Holst's widow and in 1945 in Oslo he saw the documents from the police investigation when he tried to check the case. Paus found it especially troubling that Holst had bought sleeping car tickets from Stockholm to Oslo for his wife and himself for the day after he was found dead. When he wanted to check the documents again two years later, they were gone. Paus was warned by a high-ranking Norwegian police officer, the jurist Olav Svendsen, former chief of the juridical office (Norwegian: Rettskontoret, a Norwegian intelligence organisation in neutral Sweden) against continued research into Holst's death. The same police officer also threatened Holst's widow and wife to leave the case. Ole Otto Paus was also warned by the chief of defence, Lieutenant General Ole Berg (former chief of the military office Mi2 and Mi4 at the Norwegian legation in Stockholm), against any further research into the case, as he risked his life by doing so.  Renewed research In the 1990s, Holst relatives contacted the lawyer Jan Heftye Blehr. Blehr contacted Rettsmedisinsk institutt (the Norwegian forensic institute) in order to reexamine the autopsy of Holst. The pathologist Olving stated that: "from the findings at the autopsy there is nothing that speaks against that it could be a suicide. There is however nothing that rules out that it could be a murder". On the basis of Major General Paus' statements, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security took up the case and in 1995 the historian Trond Bergh was in Stockholm and got to see what material the Swedish security police Säpo had that was related to Holst's case. According to the Minister of Justice, Grete Faremo, no new information was found. Professor Magne Skodvin at Norway's Resistance Museum looked into the case the same year. The museum used material collected by retired Supreme Court judge Einar Løchen on behalf of Ole Borge, one of Milorg's leaders and veterans, who believed Holst had been liquidated. Borge and Løchen believed it was the communists who had murdered Holst, and the same view was held by the former XU agent Wiggo Ljøner. Professor Skodvin noted certain shortcomings in the police investigation, but concluded that from the material, it was clear that the cause of death was suicide.  Questions Among the strange circumstances of the case is that Holst's dossier at the Swedish security police has been removed from the archive. Professor Tore Pryser claims that with the level of detail Säpo went into in similar cases there must have been a dossier: "Everything points to the information about Holst having been destroyed." There is however some information relating to Holst in dossiers regarding three other persons. The witness statements regarding his whereabouts when arriving in Stockholm and who he was together with the night he died are also contradictory. Holst was found dead in an apartment building where the German intelligence organisation, the Abwehr, had a cover apartment, while a British SIS agent lived in the apartment building next door. The man who opened the door via intercom was Svante Holger Ahreson, an acquaintance of Holst's. According to Ahreson's statement to the Swedish police he had only heard mumbling, thought it was someone who had called the wrong apartment, and went back to bed when no one turned up at his apartment. According to Ahreson's daughter, Holst did however have an agreement with him to lodge Norwegian resistance fighters who were under threat, and Holst was therefore in close contact with Ahreson and not some distant acquaintance. According to her, contradicting what he told the Swedish police, Ahreson had recognised Holst's voice on the intercom, waited for him to arrive at the apartment, which did not happen, but registered that the elevator passed, heard voices and after that a gunshot. According to the Swedish police Holst was found with the pistol in his right hand, something that has been interpreted as a sign of suicide. Gun experts do however say that it is highly unusual for a handgun to remain in the dead person's hand, as the recoil combined with almost immediate loss of muscle firmness will result in the weapon falling out of the person's hand. That the body was found with the gun in its right hand is also something that provoked a strong reaction from the family, as according to them Holst was left-handed. In the Swedish police's 32-page report about the case the conclusion of suicide is written in only one place: on the front page, the forensic pathologist who performed Holst's autopsy wrote Suicidum, Latin for suicide. The same physician who in his autopsy report drew no conclusion concerning how Holst died, suicide or murder, signed the police report, but according to Swedish handwriting experts the signature has been forged. Holst's superior in Stockholm in 1945, Wladimir Mörch Hansson, said that Holst received death threats, and found the lack of Swedish assistance in solving the case impossible to explain. Odd Feydt, active in the resistance group 2A and in 1943 leader of Sambandskontoret (a Norwegian intelligence office in neutral Sweden) stated that Holst was followed (tailed) during his last trip from Lillehammer to Stockholm and that Holst's death might be connected with cooperation between the Norwegian Rettskontoret and the Swedish intelligence organisation C-byrån.  The Swedish professor Ingvar Bergström, who had worked for C-byrån in Gothenburg during the war, was of the opinion that Holst had been murdered. He first stated that the liquidation had been ordered at "high levels within Milorg" but later on changed his opinion, in consultation with the retired landshövding and historian Per Nyström, to its having been done by the Swedes in cooperation with the Norwegians. Holst's close colleague during the war, the Milorg leader Jens Christian Hauge, has been criticised for refusing to assist in casting light on the case. In connection with the press coverage of the case in 1994 Hauge issued a press statement in which he stated that he did not have any specific knowledge of the case, and concluded with the following: "It would be a great relief for me and for all of Kai Holst's remaining comrades if this sad case could be solved."  Operation Claw The question has been asked whether Kai Holst's death could be connected with his task at Lillehammer, a hypothesis primarily put forward by the historian Tore Pryser. Holst might have had with him information from Lillehammer that could damage the operation later known as "Operation Claw" (in Norwegian Lillehammer-kuppet). Odd Feydt stated that when Holst travelled back to Stockholm, he was tailed from the moment he passed the Norwegian-Swedish border. The information about Operation Claw was secret in the years after the war and even today is not all available. A report in the British National Archives is classified until 2020. Kai Holst never received any decoration from Norwegian authorities for his wartime efforts, in spite of his superior Wladimir Mørch Hansson recommending one to the council of the resistance forces in January 1946. He was however posthumously commended by George VI of Great Britain on 24 June 1950 for Brave Conduct. The question has been raised of why Britain chose to honour Holst, as he never officially worked for the British. Tore Pryser has put forward the thesis that Holst, who in addition to his work for Milorg also was in the service of the British SIS, was killed by Swedish intelligence to prevent him from reporting Operation Claw to the SIS.

Clara or Klara is a female given name. It is the feminine form of the Late Latin name Clarus which meant "clear, bright, famous". Various early male Christian saints were named Clarus; the feminine form became popular after the 13th-century Saint Clare of Assisi (called Chiara in Italian), one of the followers of Saint Francis, who renounced her privileged background and founded the order of Poor Clares. Clare was the main English form of the name used in the Middle Ages, but the Latin spelling Clara became more popular in the 19th century. Glara is a related Kurdish name with a common origin, meaning "vision or brightness".

Rubus gunnianus is a species in the genus Rubus of the family Rosaceae. It is a small herb that grows in subalpine and alpine habitats above 900m throughout Tasmania, and bears edible fruit. It is commonly known as the native strawberry or Tasmanian alpine raspberry.  Taxonomy The name gunnianus comes from the botanist Ronald Campbell Gunn. Gunn worked closely with Ronald Lawrence; who knew British botanist Joseph Hooker. The authority of this species was named after Hooker. Gunn travelled around Tasmania, collecting specimens and sending them back for Hooker's book "Introduction to Flora Tasmaniae". Over 50 Tasmanian plant species gained Gunn's name, but a number of names would have since been changed over the years.  Description Rubus gunnianus is the smallest of all the species in the family Rosaceae. It grows as a small, prostrate herb in alpine habitats throughout Tasmania. When mature, the plant can spread by sending out runners to make the plant larger, as well as by setting seed. Unlike other species of the genus Rubus, this species does not have any thorns or spines. The leaves grow out from the stem as a florette, and are triangular and glossy green. The palmately compound leaves are composed of three pinnatipartite leaflets (one main one flanked by two smaller ones either side), with very long petioles.  Rubus gunnianus is monoecious (having both male and female organs on the same flower), and the flowers are small, white, with five petals. Members of the family Rosaceae are well known for producing edible fruit, which is suitable for bush tucker.  Distribution and habitat Rubus gunnianus is found in mountainous areas such as alpine moorlands, and subalpine woodlands across Tasmania, including areas such as the Central Coast, Derwent Valley, Hobart, Huon Valley and the West Coast. It is frost hardy, which is essential to alpine environments, due to the harsh weather and exposed conditions at high altitude. It prefers moist, sheltered areas among mosses and leaf litter, where it can survive the harsh conditions of alpine areas, but it can also survive in semi-exposed areas.  Uses The red, raspberry-looking fruit is edible; and is made up of a few drupes. A purple dye can be made from the fruit juice. Members of the genus Rubus are well known for their nutritional benefits of being high in vitamins and nutrients such as vitamin C, potassium, magnesium, iron and copper, while being low in sugar. This species is suitable for domestic cultivation, and R. gunnianus may be a good choice for people with limited space to grow plants, because it is quite small and would take up little room. It can also be grown in pots. R. gunnianus requires well drained moist soils, part shade to full sun, and is suitable in a variety of soil types in alpine and subalpine areas.  Conservation status Rubus gunnianus has not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List, however, it is quite common in alpine habitats throughout Tasmania; therefore no conservation concern is required at present.

Praetorium Agrippinae was a Roman settlement in the province of Lower Germania, in the area of the Cananefates, located in  modern-day Valkenburg, Netherlands. It was an army encampment (Lat.: castellum) on the Old Rhine (at the time the major branch of the river Rhine), on the northern border of the Roman Empire, the limes.  Praetorium Agrippinae is mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana between the castella of Matilo in the east and Lugdunum Batavorum to the west.  History Castellum A praetorium is a military headquarters, and Praetorium Agrippinae takes its name from the mother of the emperor Caligula, Vipsania Agrippina, who died in 33 AD. It is almost certain that Caligula stayed in the area in 39 or 40 AD, since a wine barrel from his personal vineyards was found during excavations at Valkenburg. Most probably, he visited the area in preparation for a never executed invasion of Britannia, and the castellum may have been erected for this operation. However, finds of coins and terra sigillata pottery suggest that Roman army units may have been stationed there before its construction. The fort was built in the current centre of Valkenburg, and was at first fortified by a palisaded earthen wall and three moats. Initially, two maniples (or four centuriae) of legionaries and two turmae of cavalry from the cohors III Gallorum Equitata were stationed at the fort. After the Revolt of the Batavi (69–70 AD), however, when the local tribes had razed the fortress to the ground, the entire cohors IV Thracum was relocated here. Around 180 AD the Romans enlarged the fort and rebuilt it in stone. In total, seven building phases have been distinguished. Like all other forts on the Dutch limes, Valkenburg was deserted after the collapse of the Roman border defense around 275 AD. Valkenburg, however, is one of the few castella where evidence for Late Roman building activities was found. During the reign of Constantius I Chlorus a granary was constructed here for the shipment of grain to Britannia.  Vicus To the southeast of the fortress, a large civil settlement (vicus) developed, stretching for approx. 1 km along the via militaris. It was inhabited between approx. 70 and 240 AD. Archaeological investigations have uncovered living quarters, storehouses and granaries, and possibly a bath house. A large cemetery containing over 700 graves was found as well. Between 70 and 110 AD, a small military encampment ("mini-castellum") was located here as well.  Remains Some of the finds can be seen in the Torenmuseum in Valkenburg. On the central square of town, the Castellumplein, the contours of the fort are visualised with bronze dots in the pavement. The foundations of one of the fort's gates have been reconstructed as well. Outside town, on the N206 provincial road, a reconstruction of the military road can be seen.  Excavations Valkenburg is one of the best excavated Roman sites in the Netherlands. Investigations started in 1875, but the main excavations were done between 1941 and 1953 under the direction of Albert Egges van Giffen. These excavations yielded large quantities of finds, and since the remains of the castellum were found below groundwater level, they were very well preserved and included many organic remains, such as foodstuffs, bone, leather and rope. This allowed for detailed reconstruction of Roman building practices and feeding habits. In the 1970s and 1980s, further excavations were done in the area of the vicus. A recent re-analysis showed that the houses here were built in narrow rectangular parcels, perpendicular to the military road.

The Republic of Tea is a privately owned American tea company based in Larkspur, California, that makes and sells more than 350 varieties of teas throughout North America. It was one of the first companies to offer varieties such as rooibos red tea, white tea, and tea seed oil to American consumers.  History The company was founded in 1992 by Mel Ziegler, Patricia Ziegler, and Bill Rosenzweig. The Zieglers co-founded Banana Republic and ZoZa.com. In 1994, they sold the company to Ron Rubin. Rubin's son Todd Rubin joined the company in 2007 and succeeded his father as president in 2015. Ron Rubin currently serves as The Republic of Tea's Executive Chairman and Minister of Tea. The Republic of Tea designates its employees as "ministers", its customers as "citizens", and its retail outlets as "embassies".  Practices The Republic of Tea's products are distributed through speciality retailers including Whole Foods Market and Williams Sonoma. They do not intend to expand to mass market retailers such as Costco and Walmart. The company prides itself on maintaining slow but steady growth and operating without any debt. The company supports sustainable agriculture. It sources several of its teas from biodynamic farms, a form of alternative agriculture based on pseudo-scientific and esoteric concepts. It also produces Sonoma Teas, which are made from dried grape skins that would otherwise go to waste. Prioritizing fair-trade and organic farms, the company emphasizes sustainability and the well-being of its sourcing regions and farmers. Their slogan, "Sip By Sip Rather Than Gulp by Gulp", promotes mindfulness in tea consumption. Rigorous testing is conducted at both tea garden sites and their packing facility in southern Illinois to ensure product safety.  Both Ron and Todd Rubin have said that they are not interested in selling The Republic of Tea, despite a potential valuation as high as $125 million. Ron Rubin says he has always hoped his company would remain family-owned and private.  References External links Official website Official distributor for Switzerland

Erdem Gündüz is a Turkish dancer, actor, performance artist, choreographer, and teacher who, as a result of his actions during the 2013–14 protests in Turkey, has become "the face of the protest movement against the Turkish government."  He became internationally known as "The Standing Man" in June 2013 when he stood quietly in Istanbul's Taksim Square as a protest against the conservative government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Gündüz is interested in the use of "improvisation, ritual, and public action as tools for investigating political realities and social movement."  Early life and education Gündüz was born in 1979 in Ankara, grew up in İzmir, and now lives in Istanbul. From 1996 to 2002, he studied in the Electrical and Agriculture departments at the Aegean University in Izmir. In 2003 he transferred to the Yıldız Teknik Üniversitesi in Turkey, where he studied art, design, music, and dance, receiving a B.A. degree. In 2007, as a participant in an exchange program, he took a course at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in the U.S. A year later, he attended a course in “ImPulzTanz” at the Vienna International Dance Festival. In 2008 he completed his studies with a Master of Performing Arts at Mimar Sinan University in Istanbul.  Career Gündüz has exhibited art works at the Modern Dance Society and Aegean University in Izmir; at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara; at the Istanbul Contemporary Art Museum, Galata Art Space, and the BM Contemporary Art Center in Istanbul; at the Büyük Salon in İzmit; and at the International Festival of Choreographic Miniatures in Belgrade. He has participated in several group projects in Istanbul and Ankara, and has been involved in a number of "dance performance experiences" and "theater performance experiences" in Istanbul, Ankara, Sarajevo, Venice, and elsewhere.  He has also been a street performer for many years.  Political activities before "standing man" Der Spiegel reported in 2013 that a couple of years earlier Gündüz had "protested the headscarf ban at Turkish universities."  The newspaper quoted him as saying that "We tied headscarves on and sat in the lecture halls."  Background to Taksim Square protest Peaceful protests began to take place in Istanbul on 28 May 2013 over government plans to eliminate Gezi Park, one of the city's few green areas, and to begin development on the site. Peaceful demonstrators were attacked by police with tear gas and batons, leading to national protests by people who were more concerned about the government's authoritarian response than about Gezi Park. On 17 June, the government prohibited demonstrations in Istanbul.  It was two days after police had "swept the square clear of protesters with teargas and water cannon."  The Guardian noted that after being "driven from the square and the park", protesters "talked about the need to find new ways of getting their message across."  "Standing man" At around 6 p.m. on 17 June, Gündüz drove to Taksim Square, near Gezi Park, which had been sealed off owing to the widespread anti-government protests. He walked to the center of the square and stood there silently in protest against the crackdown on demonstrations in Gezi Park. He was wearing "a white shirt and dark pants, with his backpack in front of him."  He also had several bottles of water at his feet. He was facing the Atatürk Cultural Center, which is decked in Turkish flags and at the top of which hangs a large portrait of the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who established Turkey as a secular state. Gündüz planned to stand silently in the square for a long period – several days, according to some sources; a full month, according to others.  The Huffington Post reported that his "plan was to stay standing still there for a month, breaking every 24 hours for three hours' rest, while a friend took his place." At first his act of nonviolent resistance, which he had not announced in advance and which was unaccompanied by any sign or banner explaining his action, went unnoticed. After he began to draw notice, people "began taking pictures and spreading the word about it on Twitter."  Some sources indicate that bystanders began to notice Gündüz's protest after about 15 minutes; others suggest, in the words of the New York Daily News, that "Gündüz stood for several hours unnoticed before his presence on the flashpoint square went viral on the social network Twitter."  According to NPR, many of the people on the square "didn't take him very seriously" at first, "with some even mockingly posing for photos with him"; at one juncture, "police and others tried prodding a response out of him."  Yet "he remained perfectly still and ignored them. The one occasion he did move, though, was to unbutton his pants in case they wanted to strip search him." "For this new protest to work," reported one source, "Gündüz's friends positioned themselves outside the square in a bid to prevent well-wishers trying to approach him. One of them, a young woman named Asma, explained, 'We want to protect him from any provocation...He has to be alone in the middle of the square, otherwise the police will use the pretext of a gathering to clear everyone away.'" Over time, "a human chain formed an immense circle around him. Some of the youths there began arguing over whether to join him or stay well clear, as Gündüz's friends wanted." In time, however, Gündüz was "joined by hundreds of others who in solidarity decided to join his protest by standing for hours on end."  According to one source, 300 people joined him over the course of eight hours, standing and staring at the Ataturk Cultural Center.  Eventually, at 2 a.m., "Turkish police intervened, clearing the square and arresting several demonstrators," claiming that they were blocking traffic.  Some sources indicate that there were ten arrests.  According to Reuters, however, "dozens of people who had joined Gündüz at the silent protest were arrested."  Some sources maintain that "Gündüz slipped away into the crowd," while Der Spiegel, quoting Gündüz himself, states that police officers detained him but "weren't quite sure what to do with him."  The police, reportedly, wondered: "Was it a protest, or was he crazy? Should they really go after a young man who was simply standing there?"  The police searched his backpack, finding nothing, and then "made it clear that he should get lost or expect the use of force."  Gündüz told Der Spiegel that he then "took three steps back," and when "this didn't make an impression on them…I ended my campaign. I didn't want any further violence." Gündüz became known as "the standing man."  The hashtags "standingman" and "duranadam" ("standing man" in Turkish) went viral on Twitter.  Other "standing man" actions As news of Gündüz's action spread, other opponents of the Turkish government began to engage in similar protests around the country. In the words of Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist and social-media commentator, the "standing man" concept "spread throughout Istanbul and other cities in several hours."  A woman in Ankara chose to stand in a spot where a protester had been killed by police. In Ankara, "about 25 'standingman' protesters were detained."  Three men stood at a spot in Istanbul, north of Taksim Square, where a Turkish-Armenian journalist, Hrant Dink, had been shot to death in 2007. Also, a group of men and women stood facing a former hotel in the city of Sivas where 37 people, mostly members of the Alevi minority, died in a 1993 fire started during an Islamist protest against the presence at a meeting there of a translator of Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses.  In Hatay Province on the Syrian border, "a man stood with his hands in his pockets beside a makeshift shrine for Abdullah Comert, who was killed during clashes there between police and protesters." The Business Insider reported that the day after Gündüz’s protest, "more ‘standing man’ protesters were back in Taksim Square", noting also that "The idea even spread abroad to New York City, showing the global appeal of Turkish protests that began as simple opposition to the demolition of a park in Istanbul." After Gündüz's protest, Interior Minister Muammer Güler stated "that there would be no police swoop against similar" actions. "If this protest does not harm public order or influence life generally, we will not intervene in such protests," he said.  Gündüz's views and comments Gündüz, according to the New York Daily News, "sought to play down his importance in demonstrations despite the huge number of people who followed his lead." "I'm not the type to talk about politics," Gündüz told Der Spiegel after his demonstration. "I'm an artist. I prefer to talk about dance."  He said that it was "important that I protest alone, as an individual," explaining that "When one does this in a group, it is immediately considered a terrorist organization."  He also stated that, being a dancer, he is "concerned with physicality. What am I supposed to think when a theologian says publicly that pregnant women should no longer show themselves in public because the sight of them is unsavory? When women are encouraged to have at least three, or better yet, five, children? What kind of social concept is that? What kind of understanding of freedom?" He told Hürriyet TV: "Maybe the media and people will learn something from this silent standing, this resistance...Maybe they will feel some empathy. I am just an ordinary citizen of this country. We want our voices to be heard." Gündüz told the BBC: "I am just one protester, I'm just one artist. There are many artists and many, many young people on the streets. I am nothing[,] but the idea is important, why people resist the government but the government didn't want to understand, didn't try to understand why people are on the streets [for] 19 days."  He also told the BBC that "The real violence is not showing what is going on...Four people have died, there are thousands of wounded, but the media, unfortunately, has shown us nothing." According to Der Spiegel, Gündüz "has no party affiliation, nor does he oppose Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government or support the opposition. But, like thousands of others, he has been drawn to demonstrations at Gezi Park, where people are protesting the authoritarian leadership of the country."  The Guardian, however, described Gündüz as a "left-Kemalist."  Reactions As one source put it, Gündüz's "quiet image seems to have struck a cord [sic] with sympathizers who are more used to seeing violent images of stone-throwing youths battling police officers and tear gas."  Commentators pointed out that Gündüz's peaceful, solitary protest formed a sharp contrast with the recent violent clashes in which approximately 5,000 people had been injured and at least four had died.  Many observers have compared his action to that of Tank Man, the single anti-government protester who had blocked a line of tanks in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. Gündüz has "had many imitators, and some claim they chose this form of protest before Gündüz," reported Der Spiegel. "Many are in awe of him, but he is also hated."  It has been suggested that the "standing man" approach to resistance "could prove more difficult for the government to antagonize and meet with force." "Erdem Gündüz is a legend," wrote Richard Seymour in The Guardian. "And all he had to do to earn this status was to stand completely still."  Seymour described his action as "a silent, stubborn and dignified protest against the brutality of the police response to demonstrators, which had culminated in a sinister weekend assault whose targets included medics and staff who treated the wounded. Indeed, the ministry of health went so far as to threaten to withdraw the licences of medical personnel who treated protesters injured by police."  Seymour noted that Gündüz's action drew on "the tradition of passive resistance," that such actions have "been the death knell of recalcitrant regimes," and that "passive resistance is not merely symbolic; it confuses and derails the calculations of the rulers."  Gündüz's protest, maintained Seymour, "was both an affront and a question for the authorities: beat him? Why? He's just standing there. Leave him alone? Then he wins, doesn't he?"  The "moving, motionless protest," Seymour opined, "is a symbol of great peril for the Turkish regime."  Honors and awards In 2005, the Turco-British Association gave him a prize for his work at the University Students' Art Exhibition. Gündüz won the M100 Media Award, a human-rights award, in Potsdam, Germany, in 2013. The Human Rights Foundation awarded Gündüz the 2014 Václav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent on 2 May. Gündüz' fellow 2014 laureates are the members of Russian punk protest group Pussy Riot.  Future Although he is aware of photographs of himself "with a bull's-eye on them," Gündüz "is not afraid," saying that even if Erdogan gives in to protesters, "a new government leader will come in and do similar things."  Turkey's authoritarian system, he said, "must be eliminated to make room for more democracy and freedom."  Although he intends to continue to agitate for change, however, he "isn't planning a repeat performance" of his standing-man act, explaining: "One does something like that once, and that's it."

Centre for Public Policy Research (CPPR) is an independent non-profit research organization located in Kochi, India. It was established in the year 2004. It conducts professional research, integrating developments in the areas of education, livelihood, governance, urban reforms and environment. The four focus study centers are: CPPR Centre for Urban Studies, CPPR Centre for Comparative Studies, CPPR Centre for Strategic Studies and CPPR Academy.  History CPPR was conceived as a policy think tank by a group of young individuals, who believed in Freedom of Expression, Rule of Law and Right to Livelihood. The centre aims to support the creation of an equitable, socially just and environmentally sound society enriched by the principles of democracy and secularism. In 2009, the Ministry of Science and Technology, India authorised the CPPR team and Civitas Legal Solutions to assist the Government of India (GOI) in preparing the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy. The Cabinet of India cleared the draft policy on 15 February 2012. CPPR also initiated the Digital RTI Mission in 2009, making Kerala the first RTI digital state of India.  CPPR Focus Study Centres CPPR Centre for Urban Studies Susan Zielinski, managing director of SMART, Michigan University, launched the CPPR Centre for Urban Studies in Kochi on 2 September 2013. The centre aims to understand the emergence of growth centers, market activity and the diverse nature of urbanization in India. It strives to develop market models for building sustainable systems and processes to meet the growing demands of urban spaces. It was in the forefront of initiating 'Bus Day’ in Kochi, a campaign aimed at branding buses as the best way to move about a city. The campaign encouraged people to leave their private vehicles at home and hop on to city buses, to understand the importance of the public transport system in reducing traffic and environmental issues.  CPPR Centre for Comparative Studies Dr Chandra Ranade, Adjunct Faculty of Virginia International University, launched the CPPR Centre for Comparative Studies in Kochi on 6 September 2013. The centre attempts to study the socio-economic and political factors influencing the development of states in India. It analyses the evolution of democratic processes, voting patterns and new actors of conflict in the states of India. The centre also looks into Centre–state relationship, state–state relationship and city–city relationship in the post-globalised world.  CPPR Centre for Strategic Studies CPPR Centre for Strategic Studies was launched in Kochi on 16 August 2013 . The event was marked by a lecture on 'Prospects of ASEAN in India's Look East Policy' delivered by Dr. Ernest Bower, Senior Adviser and Sumitro Chair for Southeast Asia Studies, Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), Washington D.C. It was held in association with the Office of Public Affairs, U.S. Consulate General, Chennai. The centre initiates research in the areas of energy security, maritime security, terrorism, inter-state and inter-country cooperation and extremism. It seeks to develop database and expertise on security in India at the regional level. It also aims to develop a vision plan for Centre-State relationship in national security. This will aid the Indian Government and its security agencies in developing a framework to strengthen security and coordination at the state level.  CPPR Academy CPPR Academy aims to promote research and scientific thinking and strives to spread knowledge about public policy research. The academy purports to seek partnerships with like-minded academia and institutions across the world.  Semester at Sea Around 80 students and staff of Semester at Sea (SAS), a 105-day academic voyage around the world on a floating campus, MV Explorer, anchored in Kochi for the first time in 2010. The participants visited the CPPR office in Kochi to attend a presentation on 'Social Justice, Sustainable Development and Democracy in India'. SAS is a unique course designed for students from various streams and nationalities with sessions inside a ship. The University of Virginia is the academic sponsor of the programme. SAS has now become a regular affair with Kochi and India on its map, due to the efforts of CPPR. The centre has hosted SAS six times since 2010, with the latest being a thematic session on 'Global Trade from India's Perspective' in March 2016.  Finishing School for Law Students CPPR conducts a three-day residential certificate course for law graduates called the Finishing School for Law Students (FSL). It is organised by the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Centre, the dispute resolution wing of CPPR. Launched in 2008.  Summer/Winter School on Public Policy Research Methods The concept of Winter School was initiated in 2012, when the Atlas Economic Research Foundation or Atlas Network and CPPR came together to launch a pilot venture to impart necessary training in research techniques to public policy researchers across the globe. Surprisingly, it was found that many institutions working in the arena of public policy, advocacy and policy analysis were doing research with less or no understanding of research techniques. The Atlas Network wanted CPPR to train research institutions and individual researchers, who can utilise the skills for their activities in their home countries. The primary aim was to facilitate research that stood out for its originality of thought and approach. Over the years, both Summer Schools and Winter Schools have attracted participants from Europe, Africa, Australia, America and Asia.  Internship CPPR offers internship opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students. It has hosted more than 100 interns from different educational and cultural backgrounds, who have become its campus ambassadors in India and abroad.

Charles Albert Waltner, aka C. A. Waltner (Paris 23 or 24 March 1846 – 15 June 1925 Paris) was a French artist and etcher. His father, Charles Jules Waltner, was also a French artist and etcher who engraved religious subjects for specialized publishers from 1848. Waltner studied painting under the guidance of Jean-Léon Gérôme and Léon Bonnat. Later he was taught by Henriquel-Dupont in the art of copper cutting and etching. Waltner became known for his ability to render large color paintings by the likes of Rembrandt, Thomas Gainsborough and Jules Breton into etchings. The etchings were in turn converted into prints by firms like Arthur Tooth & Sons. The final prints were typically sold to the general public at a more affordable price than the original work using a network of dealers. In the case of works where the original artist was still alive, the original artist frequently encouraged the practice and may have signed the final prints along with Waltner. Prints helped the original artist increase their income as well as spread their fame. In 1868 Waltner won a Prix de Rome scholarship that allowed him to live and study in Rome. He was a member of the jury and exhibited at the first international exhibition of white and black in 1885 at the Pavillon de Flore, and participated as a founder in the reopening of the National Society of Fine Arts. In 1908, he was admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts.  Major etchings This is a non-exhaustive list of the artist's etchings and the name of the original artist. Waltner signed many of the prints that were produced from his etchings. In general they tended to rather large format. One of the largest ones "La Ronde de Nuit" (aka "The Night Watch"), 1885, after the original by Rembrandt is Size: (sheet) 970 x 1085 cm; (plate) 812 x 940 cm; (chine collé) 789 x 922 cm; (image borderline) 690 x 838 cm. Owing to their relative large size, most Waltner prints that have survived till today were either protected behind glassed frames or part of a major collection.  However, protection behind a glassed frame is also a mixed blessing. Acids coming from the mat and backing papers lead to the discoloration of a print even if it was originally produced using acid free paper. A full conservation of a print preserved behind glass requires removal of all papers and treatment of the print itself by a professional.  1870. Portrait du baron H. de Vicq (Rubens). 1872.

Camaldolese Church, dating from the 17th–18th centuries and situated among the buildings of the hermitage in the Bielański Forest, is one of the most beautiful baroque churches in Warsaw.  History The King of Poland Władysław IV Vasa (Polish: Władysław IV Waza) founded the first church in Bielański Forest as a vote of gratitude for royal election the crown and winning in the Smolensk campaign. The church had to be situated in a remote area according to the Camaldoleses tradition and it was built on the area of former village Pólko (now Bielany). In 1669–1710 and 1733–1755 the church was rebuilt, the founders of the project were Polish kings John II Casimir (Polish: Jan II Kazimierz Waza) and Michael I (Polish: Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki).  During the 19th century Poland was under partitions. After the fall of the January Uprising in 1864, Tsarist occupation authorities liquidated all Camaldoles monasteries with the exception of the Warsaw. In the next years, Russian authorities took over some of the buildings. The Russians introduced a ban on the admission of new members. After that, the church and hermitages were taken over by the Russian Red Cross.  In 1905 a parish was created and the church was renovated. After Russian's withdrawal from Warsaw in 1914 an orphanage was formed and run by Sisters. In 1916 a seminar was launched and in 1918 a junior high school was built in the former foresterium. Nowadays the church and the hermitage huts are preserved in their original state. After the destruction of the 2nd World War and burning down of the gymnasium building, the former monastery buildings were redesigned by the ATK (Catholic Theology Academy), now UKSW (Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University), and on the site of the hostelry and the remnants of the gymnasium building there is a modern seminary building being erected by the Warsaw Archdiocese.  Architecture Standing in front of the facade of the church we are exactly on the axis of the monastic complex. It is pointed out by the wooden cross standing at today Dewajtis street. From the setting of that cross in 1693 began to pave the grounds of the monastery. The monastery complex consists of a gate, church, 13 hermitages and foresterium. According to Mariusz Karpowicz the church was designed by Italian architect Isidoro Affaitati.  Facade The facade was erected when the church with the main body had been already built. The designer of that late Baroque works could be a Roman architect Gaetano Chiaveri. The facade is triaxle – the central part is a little forward of and topped with a tympanum, enclosed in a pair of composite pilasters and columns. Here there are two architectural styles late Baroque and early Classicism. The first of them can be seen in the details and the second one in the central part and columns. In the side niches are set two wooden polychrome sculptures. The first shows Saint Benedict and the second one Saint Romuald.  Interior Interior decorations are in rococo style. the church has an octagonal plan cut by cross. Presbytery is a double span, closed semicircular. There is an octagonal nave, which cut transept by transverse axis. The transept is made by two symmetrical chapels. We can observe a great sailing vault. On the diagonal axes are four chapels lower than those which determine presbytery. Consistency adds fact that the whole interior has part of Corinthian style for example columns. Between the chapels there are placed narrow passages.  Hermitages Walking around the church, we can see 13 hermitages. They are arranged in four parallel rows on either side of the central axis formed. Between houses connected by low walls fences are situated gardens. All hermitages have the same interior. In the center there is cross-vaulted hall, on the one side there is a cell and small utility room, on the other side we can see chapel and woodshed.  Nowadays Today it is a parish church.

The Franziskaner-Klosterkirche was a church in the Mitte district of Berlin, founded in 1250 and now in ruins.  History It was founded in 1250 in the early Gothic style as a monastery church for a Franciscan house. It was a fieldstone church, 52 metres long and 16 metres wide. Its remains can be found in the north wall of the present ruins. This was replaced with a three-aisled brick basilica church, begun at the end of the 13th century and completed in the first half of the 14th century, whose ruins still survive. In 1365 Louis II, Elector of Brandenburg was buried there. Around 1500 it was renovated. The monastery was closed due to the Protestant Reformation's arrival in Berlin in 1539. None of the monastic buildings survive, though some of them housed Berlin's first printing press from 1571 and the Evangelisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster from 1574. Pupils and teachers at the latter included Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, whilst Otto von Bismarck also visited the church. Leonhard Thurneysser ran the printing press and also restored the church between 1583 and 1584. Small modifications were made in the second half of the 17th century, such as demolishing the old staircase tower, building a new timber staircase on the west side and in 1712 demolishing the rood screen separating the nave from the chancel. 1712 also saw a fire in the church's roof and in 1719 the church was restored, raising the floor level by 1 metre and bricking up two northern choir windows. Extensive renovations were carried out in the first half of the 19th century - the gabled tower was demolished in 1826, two new towers were built on the west side in 1842, a new sacristy was built and the floor lowered again. Plans were produced for the work by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Christian Gottlieb Cantian and the former track-inspector Berger was preceded by the construction work - Berger's second design was that ultimately implemented. Work lasted until 1845, though the church was closed due to severe damp in its masonry in 1902 and in 1926 most of the 19th century changes were reversed. The church was re-consecrated on 24 May 1936. The church was destroyed on 3 April 1945 in the bombing of Berlin in World War II. In 1950 the debris was removed and the church ruins secured between 1959 and 1963, although the ruined monastic buildings were demolished completely to make way for a park. The ruins were restored again in 2003-2004 and are now used for exhibitions, plays and concerts.  Bibliography Kirchenruine des Grauen Klosters in Berlin. Hrsg. vom Landesdenkmalamt Berlin.
