The natural resources acts were a series of Acts passed by the Parliament of Canada and the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan in 1930 to transfer control over crown lands and natural resources within these provinces from the Government of Canada to the provincial governments.  Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan had not been given control over their natural resources  when they entered Confederation, unlike the other Canadian provinces.  British Columbia had surrendered certain portions of its natural resources and Crown lands to the federal government, the Railway Belt and the Peace River Block, when it entered Confederation in 1871, as part of the agreement for the building of the transcontinental railway. Following protracted negotiations, in 1930 the Government of Canada and the four provinces reached a series of agreements for the transfer of the administration of the natural resources to the provincial governments, called the Natural Resources Transfer Agreements.  Parliament and the four provincial legislatures then passed acts to implement the agreements.  Finally, the British Parliament passed the Constitution Act, 1930, to ratify the agreements, entrenching them in the Constitution of Canada.  The passage of these Acts rendered the Dominion Lands Act obsolete, since these same lands were no longer under federal jurisdiction. A few small sections of resource-rich territory were excluded from the act, although they would be transferred later. First Nations reserves and lands reserved for indigenous persons were excluded under the Indian Act. National parks were also excluded - they remain under the jurisdiction of the federal government, and are generally off-limits to resource development.  Impact on Treaty Rights The Natural Resource Transfer Agreements with the three Western Provinces provide that laws respecting game in the province shall apply to Indians within the boundaries of the province. However, the rights granted to Indians under treaties to hunt, trap and fish are usually considered integral to the surrender of their lands, and are therefore maintained under the Transfer Agreement.

KRAM (1070 AM) was a radio station licensed to serve West Klamath, Oregon, United States. The station, established in 1989, was owned by Scott D. MacArthur, personal representative of the estate of Sandra A. Falk.  KRAM fell silent in July 2006 and was deleted from the FCC database in February 2010.  Programming Before falling silent in July 2006, KRAM broadcast a nostalgia music radio format branded as "The Ram".  History This station received its original construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission on June 6, 1985.  The FCC assigned the new station the KWSA call sign on October 23, 1985.  KWSA received its license to cover from the FCC on June 7, 1989. In September 1996, Western States Broadcasting reached an agreement to sell this station to Sandra Ann Falk.  The deal was approved by the FCC on December 16, 1996, and the transaction was consummated on January 9, 1997.  The new owner had the FCC change the station's legal call sign to KRAM on May 1, 1997. Station owner Sandra Ann Falk died on June 23, 2006, and the station fell silent on July 1, 2006.  Scott D. MacArthur filed an application with the FCC in July 2007 to have the broadcast license involuntarily transferred to him as the personal representative of the estate of Sandra Ann Falk. The transfer was approved by the FCC on August 8, 2007.  MacArthur, in an August 2007 filing with the FCC, declared his intention to sell KRAM to a third party to "allow the estate to pay creditors, including local merchants and the state of Oregon." However, by February 2010 the station had not yet been sold.  On February 24, 2010, the FCC dismissed the long-standing application for authorization to remain silent, declared the station's broadcast license forfeit, and deleted the KRAM call sign from the broadcast database.

Aromanian music (Aromanian: Muzica armãneascã) is the music characteristic of the Aromanians. The Aromanians are an ethnic group scattered throughout the Balkans, living in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia, Romania and Serbia. Aromanian music has received influence from the music of other ethnic groups of the Balkans, such as that of the Albanians, Bulgarians, Greeks, Macedonians, Romanians and more. However, it has developed throughout history its own distinctive features and peculiarities that set it apart from other Balkan music genres, and has also influenced the music of the previously mentioned peoples. Aromanian music has not been extensively studied by researchers, often being overshadowed by the music of other ethnic groups in the Balkans. One of the main characteristics of Aromanian music is the importance of polyphonic music (music with two or more performers), as Aromanian musicians tend to perform in groups. The performance of polyphonic music follows a series of common rules among the Aromanians. For example, there is always a lead singer who starts the song and acts as a leader, known in Aromanian as the atselu tsi u lja ("the one who takes it [the song]"). There is also a second singer, atselu tsi u talji ("the one who cuts it"), who begins singing shortly after the main singer, as well as other positions. Monophonic music (music with one single performer) is also present in Aromanian music, and has historically been more researched than Aromanian polyphonic music. Despite being a unitary music genre, Aromanian music has several variations, styles and ways of performing it that can be classified according to the countries in which they live and which in turn can be subdivided into more variations and styles. Some of the subgenres of Aromanian music include ballads, dancing songs, epic songs and lyrical songs. Today, there are several projects and cultural organizations advocating for the preservation of the music of this ethnic group. An example is the Lunjina Serbian–Aromanian Association in Serbia, which in 2021 announced that it was working on the publication of a CD of traditional Aromanian music. Another example is the Conservation and promotion of the singing traditions of the Fãrsherot Aromanians of Dobruja project, organized by several Aromanian organizations in Romania. Some examples of popular Aromanian music performers or musicians of Aromanian ethnicity include Eli Fara, Elena Gheorghe, Nikos Karakostas, Takis Mousafiris, Dimitris Mitropanos, Toše Proeski, Parashqevi Simaku, Vassilis Tsitsanis and Adrian Uzum. A notable Aromanian song is "Dimãndarea pãrinteascã" ("The Will of the Forefathers"), often used as the ethnic anthem of the Aromanians. Another popular Aromanian song is the traditional Di la Aminciu pãn' la Ameru ("From Metsovo to Milea").  See also Polyphonic song of Epirus   == References ==

Plaza Moraga is a public square in Manila, Philippines. Serving as the gateway to Manila's Chinatown of Binondo, the plaza is located at the foot of Jones Bridge at the west end of Escolta Street. It was named after a Franciscan friar, Fr. Fernando de Moraga and it is by the opinion of many, that were it not for him, the history of the Philippines would turn out differently from what it is now.  History Plaza Moraga came to develop during the American colonization period. It was the place where superb restaurants, commercial establishments and foreign embassies could be found. One of the familiar places-to-visit here was the Clarke's Cafe which opened in 1899. They were known for selling ice cream.  Fernando de Moraga The Venerable Fernando de Moraga was born in one of the towns in the province of Salamanca, Spain. In 1597, he visited the Philippines and stayed for a short period near Plaza Dilao in Paco and some of the towns in the provinces of Bulacan and Laguna. In 1607, he was appointed as the parish priest of Santa Ana. In Intramuros, he also became the local Superior of the San Francisco Convent some years after his duty in Santa Ana. He was elected as the Chapter president before being delegated to the General Chapter in Spain in 1616. He reached Spain in 1619 while traveling barefooted through the Middle East while begging, evangelizing and baptizing along the way.  Fr. Moraga has convinced the King, through his persuasion and knowledge on the colony to revoke the decree and keep the Philippines during that time when King Philip III of Spain had issued a decree that included surrendering the Philippines.  In recent years Plaza Moraga has now become a plaza occupied mostly by cars and a big parking space is designated on one of the corners. There are still commercial buildings surrounding the plaza including The Original Savory Restaurant, a Chinese restaurant known for their chicken. It succeeded the famed Savory Restaurant that was razed by fire in 2015. However, the famous ice cream parlor is already closed. In June 2015, the world's largest Chinatown arch was built on the south side of Plaza Moraga at the entrance to Binondo from Jones Bridge in celebration of the city's 444th founding anniversary as well as the 40th anniversary of Philippines-China diplomatic ties. Funded as a gift from the city government of Guangzhou, it measures 63.8 feet (19.4 m) high and 74 feet (23 m) wide, higher than Washington, D.C. Chinatown's Friendship Archway.

Peter Charles Doherty  (born 15 October 1940) is an Australian immunologist and Nobel laureate. He received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1995, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with Rolf M. Zinkernagel in 1996 and was named Australian of the Year in 1997. In the Australia Day Honours of 1997, he was named a Companion of the Order of Australia for his work with Zinkernagel. He is also a National Trust Australian Living Treasure. In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Doherty's immune system research was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an iconic "innovation and invention".  Early life and education Peter Charles Doherty was born in the Brisbane, suburb of Sherwood on 15 October 1940, to Eric Charles Doherty and Linda Doherty (née Byford). He grew up in Oxley, and attended Indooroopilly State High School (which now has a lecture theatre named after him). After receiving his bachelor's degree in veterinary science in 1962 from the University of Queensland, he was a rural veterinary officer for the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock before taking up laboratory-based work at the Department's Animal Research Institute. There he met microbiology graduate Penelope Stephens and they were married in 1965. Doherty received his master's degree in veterinary science in 1966 from the University of Queensland.  He obtained his PhD in pathology  in 1970 from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, then returned to Australia to continue his  research at the John Curtin School of Medical Research within the Australian National University in Canberra.  Research and career Doherty's research focused on the immune system and his Nobel Prize-winning work described how the body's immune cells protect against viruses. He and Rolf Zinkernagel, the co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, discovered how T cells recognise their target antigens in combination with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. Viruses infect host cells and reproduce inside them. Killer T-cells destroy those infected cells so that the viruses cannot reproduce. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that, in order for killer T cells to recognise infected cells, they had to recognise two molecules on the surface of the cell – not only the virus antigen, but also a molecule of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This recognition was done by a T-cell receptor on the surface of the T cell. The MHC was previously identified as being responsible for the rejection of incompatible tissues during transplantation. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that the MHC was responsible for the body fighting meningitis viruses too.  Awards and honours Doherty was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1987. In 1997, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He is the patron of the eponymous Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (Doherty Institute), a joint venture between the University of Melbourne and Melbourne Health. It houses a group of infection and immunology experts, including Director Professor Sharon Lewin, who are charged with leading the battle against infectious diseases in humans. This became operational in 2014. He became an Honorary Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 2015. In the same year he was elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of Health and Medical Sciences (FAHMS). In April 2017 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Victoria (FRSV). John Monash Science School, Moreton Bay Boys College, and Murrumba State Secondary College each have a house named after him.  Non academic publications Doherty, Peter (2022).

Wabbit is a 1982 video game by Apollo for the Atari 2600. The game is reported to be the "first console game with a named playable female character who isn't off-screen".  Gameplay Wabbit is a farming simulation game with elements of the shoot 'em up genre in which the player controls a female character named "Billie Sue". Rabbits have descended upon Sue's farm and are quickly devouring her crop of carrots. In order to ward off the rabbits, the player must throw rotten eggs at them before they are able to carry away Sue's carrots. The player scores points by hitting rabbits, and the rabbits score points by carrying carrots off-screen. As the player's score increases, the rabbits move progressively faster. The game ends when either the player scores 1300 points or the rabbits' score reaches 100; whenever the player's score reaches a multiple of 100, the rabbits' score is lowered.  Development In the early 1980s, Apollo received a number of letters from fans suggesting potential games they could develop. Coincidentally, two such letters simultaneously proposed the idea of having a farmer defend a farm from rabbits. Apollo had recently hired Van Mai (then Van Tran), a programmer originally from Vietnam who had done work with computer graphics for the Dallas Independent School District but was new to the video games industry. While the letters had the player assume the role of a male protagonist, she proposed creating a game aimed at girls featuring a female character instead, named Billie Sue. The proposal was accepted, and Tran designed and created the game as the sole developer on the project. Development took four to six months. It was showcased at the Texas State Fair in October 1982 around the time of release.  Reception Video game historian Kevin Bunch describes Wabbit as "colorful" and "probably one of the best games [Apollo] put out." One modern critic likewise praised the game's graphics as "refreshing" for its time, though criticizing the gameplay as frustrating, particularly as the speed of the rabbits increased.  Legacy The game is reported to be the "first console game with a named playable female character who isn't off-screen". For decades, efforts have been made to contact the programmer, whose name was reported by former coworkers as "Ban Tran". Her actual name was discovered in 2022, and she was interviewed by the Video Game History Foundation in the following May. Wabbit was the only game Tran developed for Apollo, as the company declared bankruptcy in November 1982; she later worked on a port of Solar Fox for the Atari 5200 for MicroGraphic Image, before leaving the video game industry.

In the New Zealand judicial system a cultural report is a document supplied to the court in order to establish a cultural context for a defendant's actions and to aide in their rehabilitation. In New Zealand law, they are allowed under section 27 of the Sentencing Act 2002, and so are also called S27 reports. Although cultural reports are not required, they have become increasingly common since 2019, and are frequently submitted by defendants in order to receive lighter sentencing.  History The cost of cultural reports has been the subject of criticism, as the amount billed to legal aid or the Public Defence Service for cultural reports increased from $639,311 in 2019 to $3.3 million in 2020, and reached $5.91 million for the period between July 2021 and June 2022. The additional value of the reports has also been called into question, as critics like independent justice advocate Ruth Money suggest that pre-sentence reports provided by the probation services of Department of Corrections already provide background on defendants. Harry Tam, a Mongrel Mob member and consultant who provides cultural reports says that distinct from the pre-sentencing reports, S27 reports are "predominantly focused on looking at the disadvantages that may have contributed to the person’s offending behaviour and options to address it". In 2018 the Ministry of Justice ceased funding for cultural reports, shifting that responsibility to legal aid.  2024 Reform On 7 February 2024, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith  announced that government funding for cultural reports would be stopped under the new National-led government. The Government's decision was criticised by People Against Prisons Aotearoa spokesperson Emmy Rākete, Green Party Tamatha Paul, Defence Lawyer Association founder Elizabeth Hall and Labour Party Member of Parliament Ginny Andersen, who claimed it was punitive, would disadvantage Māori and the working class, and impede the rehabilitation and treatment of prisoners with health and behavioural issues. By contrast, Goldsmith and ACT party justice spokesperson Todd Stephenson defended the scrapping of cultural reports on the grounds of their rising costs and prioritising victims' rights over their offenders. ACT party wanted to go much further by removing cultural reports from the Sentencing Act outright. On 6 March 2024, the Government passed urgent legislation ending taxpayer funding for cultural reports.   == References ==

Partridge Island is a Canadian island located in the Bay of Fundy off the coast of Saint John, New Brunswick, within the city's Inner Harbour. The island is a provincial historic site and was designated a National Historic Site in 1974. It lies on the west side of the mouth of the Saint John River. During the American Revolution, in 1780, six British troops from Major Timothy Hierlihy's corps, under the command of Lieut. Wheaton, attacked eight American privateers in a house they were occupying on Partridge island.  The British killed three of the privateers and the other five were taken prisoner. Partridge Island was first established as a quarantine station and pest house in 1785 by the Saint John Royal Charter, which also set aside the island for use as a navigational aid station and a military post. Its first use as a quarantine station was not until 1816. A hospital was constructed on the island in 1830.  Immigration and memorials The island received its largest influx of immigrants in the 1840s during the "Great Famine", also known as the "Irish Potato Famine," when a shortage of potatoes occurred due to potato blight striking Ireland's staple crop.  The famine caused millions to starve to death or otherwise emigrate, mainly to North America. During the famine, some 30,000 immigrants were processed by the island's visiting and resident physicians, with 1,196 dying at Partridge Island and the adjacent city of Saint John during the Typhus epidemic of 1847.  During the 1890s there were over 78,000 immigrants a year being examined or treated on the island. A memorial to the Irish immigrants of the mid-1840s was set up on the island in the 1890s, but by World War One it had deteriorated. In 1926 the Saint John City Cornet Band approached Saint John contractor George McArthur who agreed to lead a campaign to build a suitable monument. The Celtic Cross memorial to the Irish dead of 1847 was dedicated in 1927. This was restored and rededicated in 1985. In the early and mid-1980s, memorials were built by the Saint John Jewish Community, the Loyal Orange Lodge, the Partridge Island Research Project, and the Partridge Island & Harbour Heritage Inc., a company that was registered in 1988 and dissolved in 2004.  The memorials were dedicated to the Protestant, Catholic and Jewish immigrants buried in the six island graveyards.  A monument was also dedicated to all of the Irish dead from 1830 to the 1920s.  History The island's folklore begins with the Mi'kmaq Nation, who referred to the island as "Quak'm'kagan'ik" meaning "a piece cut out."  This name is in reference to the belief that the island was created when Glooscap smashed the dam that "Big Beaver" had built. At the Reversing Falls Rapids a piece of the dam was swept in the rush of water to the mouth of the harbour where it came to rest to form the island. This version of the legend dates to the early 20th century. The 19th century version refers to Partridge Island in Minas Basin in Nova Scotia. Following the arrival of the American Loyalists from the American Revolutionary War in 1783, and the formation of the city of Saint John, there was the need for a lighthouse to aid shipping. A light station was erected on Partridge Island and began operating in 1791. It was only the third light station to have been built in British North America. A signal station was soon located on the island and it was used for many years to alert the harbour to vessels approaching from the Bay of Fundy. The island's light and signal station were both established in 1791. The island was Saint John's principal military fortification from 1800 until 1947. It was the only Saint John fortification to be used during all periods of Saint John's military activity. There are still visible remains of the Royal Artillery gun battery of 1812, and of both the First and Second World Wars. The island was also home to dozens of island families over the years, from lightkeepers such as Captain Samuel Duffy, James Wilson, Albert Smith, Charles Mitchell and Thomas Furness, to hospital staff such as Doctors George and William Harding, hospital stewards Thomas McGowan, Fred and Jim Hargrove, and teachers for the island's school such as Jean MacCullum and Forbes Elliott. Boat tours to the island operated from 1982 until 1995 when the island's small museum closed. Public access is now restricted. There have been numerous books written about the island as well as video documentaries.  Efforts to reopen the island Ambitions to turn Partridge Island into a tourist site have been ongoing. In 2014, the federal government set aside $200,000 for a feasibility study which would assess the cost of repairing the breakwater and creating a walkway that would cross to the island as well as annual operation and maintenance costs. The study found that it would cost between $27-$40 million to create a path to the island. Wayne Long, MP for Saint John, has proposed that a wharf be built at the site and that boat tours would go to and from it.  Long said in 2017, "The time for action is now" about creating access to the historic island. Long estimates that the wharf would cost only $5 million, which is a sharp reduction from the cost of a walkway. Before opening to the public, a clean-up of the island's significant soil contaminates would have to be done. All of the remaining buildings on the site have been vandalized or burned. Of the six graveyards, the 19th-century graveyard was almost obliterated by the military during World War II. Less than three dozen graves remain. Many young people from the local area go to the island, although it is illegal to cross the breakwater.

New England Airlines is a regional airline based in Westerly, Rhode Island, USA. With a main base at Westerly State Airport, it provides scheduled service to Block Island and operates charters to other airports along the Northeast coast.  History The airline was established and started operations in 1970. New England Airlines has been in continuous service since then, under the same private ownership. It was and is the only scheduled airline with its primary bases of operation in Rhode Island. This was designed to fulfill the loss of service from a short-lived airline called Viking Airways, which folded in the 1960s. The airline is noted for its provision of cargo delivery services, including Chinese food (and other restaurant orders) delivered from the mainland to the Block Island airport in as little as 90 minutes. The airline only has a half dozen pilots during the winter and over a dozen during the summertime. According to the owner, half of the business comes from charter requests for business workers in the New York area and other locations along the northeast coast.  Destinations for scheduled flights Fleet The New England Airlines fleet consists of the following aircraft:  Accidents November 28, 1989: BN-2 Islander, N127JL, flying to Westerly crashed into the sea 3 to 5 miles northwest of Block Island. All 8 people on board, 7 passengers and pilot John Beck Jr., were killed. Among the victims, Shirley Wood, was the publisher and co-editor of The Block Island Times, founding editor of People magazine, and former chief of research for Time Life Books. The flight proceeded under a cloud layer on a moonless night while a SIGMET was in effect for moderate to occasionally severe turbulence and possible low level wind shear. The reason for the crash was undetermined. September 5, 1999: A Piper Cherokee PA-32-260, N4830S, departing Westerly on a scheduled flight to Block Island lost control and crashed shortly after take off, killing two passengers and the pilot; two passengers survived with serious injuries. Pilot Michael Hadik was described as a skilled pilot and flight instructor, with 5259 hours total and 202 in the Cherokee. The NTSB final report determined the cause of the crash was loss of control and stall during a turn.  References External links  New England Airlines

Archie Moore (born Archibald Lee Wright; December 13, 1913 – December 9, 1998) was an American catch wrestler and professional boxer and the longest reigning World Light Heavyweight Champion of all time (1952 – 1962). He had one of the longest professional careers in the history of the sport, competing from 1935 to 1963. Nicknamed "The Mongoose", and then "The Old Mongoose" in the latter half of his career, Moore was a highly strategic and defensive boxer. As of December 2020, BoxRec ranks Moore as the third greatest pound-for-pound boxer of all time. He also ranks fourth on The Ring's list of "100 greatest punchers of all time". Moore was also a trainer for a short time after retirement, training Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Bob Foster, Eddie Mustafa Muhammad, Earnie Shavers and James Tillis. A native of Benoit, Mississippi, Moore was raised in St. Louis, Missouri, and grew up in poverty. Moore was denied a shot at the world title for 15 years, and spent many of those years fighting on the road with little to show for it. An important figure in the American Black community, he became involved in African American causes once his days as a fighter were over. He also established himself as a successful character actor in television and film. Moore died in his adopted home of San Diego, California; he was 84 years old.  Early life Moore was born Archibald Lee Wright, the son of Thomas Wright, a farm laborer and drifter, and Lorena Wright. He always insisted that he was born in 1916 in Collinsville, Illinois, his mother told reporters that he was actually born in 1913 in Benoit, Mississippi. His father abandoned the family when Archie was an infant. Unable to provide for him and his older sister, his mother gave them into the care of an uncle and aunt, Cleveland and Willie Pearl Moore, who lived in St. Louis. Archie later explained why he was given their surname: "It was less questions to be called Moore." He attended segregated all-Black schools in St. Louis, including Lincoln High School, although he never graduated. His uncle and aunt provided him with a stable upbringing, but after his uncle died in a freak accident around 1928, Moore began running with a street gang. One of his first thefts was a pair of oil lamps from his home, which he sold so that he would have money to buy boxing gloves. He later recalled of his stealing: "It was inevitable that I would be caught. I think I knew this even before I started, but somehow the urge to have a few cents in my pocket made me overlook this eventuality". After he was arrested for attempting to steal change from a motorman's box on a streetcar, he was sentenced to a three-year term at a reform school in Booneville, Missouri. He was released early from the school for good behavior after serving twenty-two months. Around 1933 Moore joined the Civilian Conservation Corps, working for the forestry division at a camp in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. Determined to become a boxer, he decided to make his work at the camp a form of training. He later recalled that the other boys constantly kidded him about one daily exercise—standing upright in the bed of a truck as it drove along primitive forest roads, waiting until the last possible moment before ducking or weaving away from tree branches.  Boxing career The captain of the camp permitted him to organize a boxing team, which competed in Golden Gloves tournaments in southern Missouri and Illinois. Many of his fights occurred in a racially charged atmosphere; he later described one of them, against a white boxer named Bill Richardson in Poplar Bluff:I knocked him down with a volley of head punches about one minute into round one. His brother ... was the referee. He was furious at me and told me to keep my punches up. Since I had been hitting Bill in the head I would have missed him altogether if I threw my punches any higher. But the referee said I had fouled him. ... I got steamed at this and offered to fight [the referee], too. I resolved not to hit Bill any place but his head. ... In the second round I dropped him with a left hook that spun his head like a top. ... I heard a man at ringside say, "For two cents I'd shoot that nigger."  First retirement and comeback Moore had four fights in 1941, during which he went 2–1–1, with the draw against Eddie Booker. By then, however, he had suffered through several stomach ulcers and the resulting operations, and had announced his retirement from boxing. His retirement was brief. By 1942 he was back in the ring. He won his first six bouts that year, including a second-round knockout of Hogue in a rematch, and a ten-round decision over Jack Chase. He met Booker in a rematch, and reached the same conclusion as their first meeting had: another 10-round draw. In 1943, Moore fought seven bouts, winning five and losing two. He won and then lost the California State Middleweight title against Chase, both by 15-round decisions, and beat Chase again in his last bout of that year, in a ten-round decision. He also lost a decision to Aaron Wade that year.  The Atlantic Coast In 1944, he had nine bouts, going 7–2. His last bout that year marked his debut on the Atlantic Coast, and the level of his opposition began to improve. He beat Jimmy Hayden by a knockout in five, lost to future Hall of Famer Charlie Burley by a decision, and to Booker by a knockout in eight. He won his first eight bouts of 1945, impressing Atlantic coast boxing experts and earning a fight with light heavyweight Jimmy Bivins, a boxer that was not considered a hard puncher, who defeated Moore by a knockout in six at Cleveland. He returned to the Eastern Seaboard to fight five more times before that year was over. He met, among others, light heavyweight Holman Williams during that span, losing a ten-round decision, and knocking him out in eleven in the rematch. By 1946, Moore had moved to the light heavyweight division and he went 5–2–1 that year, beating contender Curtis Sheppard, but losing to future World Heavyweight Champion and Hall of Famer Ezzard Charles by a decision in ten, and drawing with old nemesis Chase. By then, Moore began complaining publicly that, according to him, none of boxing's world champions would risk their titles fighting him. 1947 was essentially a year of rematches for Moore. He went 7–1 that year, his one loss being to Charles. He beat Chase by a knockout in nine, Sheppard by a decision in ten and Bivins by a knockout in nine. He also defeated Burt Lytell, by a decision in ten. On June 2, 1948, Leonard Morrow (12–2–1) KO’d Archie Moore (92–14–7) in the first round to win the California light heavyweight championship. Years later when asked about the fight with Morrow, Archie would claim he had accidentally fouled Morrow and reached out his hand as a sign of an apology, but this wasn't what happened. He had also forgotten he had told the newspapers what had really happened while he was in California before his fight with Bob Dunlap, saying, “I never dreamed this kid could hurt me. I thought I’d spar a bit and see what he had. He hit me hard. I got up and he swarmed all over me. Never was I so humiliated.” He fought a solid 14 fights in 1948, losing again to Charles by a knockout in nine, losing to Henry Hall by a decision in ten and to Lloyd Gibson by a disqualification in four. But he also beat Ted Lowry, by a decision in ten, and Hall in a rematch, also by decision. In 1949, he had 13 bouts, going 12–1. He defeated the Alabama Kid twice; by knockout in four and by knockout in three, Bob Satterfield by a knockout in three, Bivins by a knockout in eight, future World Light Heavyweight Champion and IBHOF inductee Harold Johnson by a decision, Bob Sikes by a knockout in three and Phil Muscato by a decision. He lost to Clinton Bacon by a disqualification in six. By Moore's standards, 1950 was a vacation year for him: he only had two fights, winning both, including a 10-round decision in a rematch with Lydell. In 1951, Moore boxed 18 times, winning 16, losing one, and drawing one. He went on an Argentinian tour, fighting seven times there, winning six and drawing one. In between those seven fights, he found time for a trip to Montevideo, Uruguay, where he defeated Vicente Quiroz by a knockout in six. He knocked out Bivins in nine and split two decisions with Johnson.  World Light Heavyweight Champion 1952 was one of the most important years in Moore's life. After beating Johnson, heavyweight contenders Jimmy Slade, Bob Dunlap, and Clarence Henry and light heavyweight Clinton Bacon (knocked out in four in a rematch), Moore was finally given an opportunity at age 36 (he later learned he was actually nearly 39, his mother confirming he had been born in 1913, not 1916) to fight for the title of World Light Heavyweight Champion against future IBHOF honoree Joey Maxim. Maxim had just defeated the great Sugar Ray Robinson by a technical knockout in 14 rounds, forcing Robinson to quit in his corner due to heat exhaustion. Against Maxim, Moore consistently landed powerful right hands, hurting him several times en route to a fifteen-round decision. After sixteen long years, he had finally achieved his dream. The next year, Moore won all nine of his bouts, including a 10-round, non-title win against then fringe heavyweight contender Nino Valdez of Cuba and a 15-round decision over Maxim in a rematch to retain the belt. He made two more bouts in Argentina before the end of the year.  In 1954, he had only four fights, retaining the title in a third fight with Maxim, who once again went the 15 round distance, and versus Johnson, whom he knocked out in 14. He also beat highly ranked heavyweight Bob Baker. In 1955, Moore again beat Valdez, who by that time was the no. 1 heavyweight contender, and defended against Bobo Olson, the World Middleweight Champion and future Hall of Famer who was coming off a decision victory over Joey Maxim, by a knockout in three. "The Mongoose" received two cracks at the heavyweight championship of the world. On September 21, 1955, Moore faced future Hall of Famer Rocky Marciano at New York's Yankee Stadium. The fight was originally scheduled for September 20, according to Trilogy Book. It was in this fight Archie came closest to wearing the belt. A Moore surprise right hand in the 2nd round sent Marciano down for the second and final time in his career, setting the stage for a legendary battle, but also creating controversy as far as shared memory. In subsequent years Moore made much of Referee Harry Kessler's handling of the pivotal moment. A half-decade on, in Archie's autobiography, The Archie Moore Story (1960), he describes in detail the referee, though Rocky arose at "two", continuing a superfluous mandatory eight-count: "...Kessler went on, three, four. The mandatory count does not apply in championship bouts (1955)...My seconds were screaming for me to finish him and I moved to do so, but Kessler...carefully wiped off Rocky's gloves, giving him another few seconds...he gave him a sort of stiff jerk, which may have helped Rocky clear his head." Moore admits to being angry enough at what he saw as interference, he went recklessly, "blind and stupid with rage", going for the knockout, toe-to-toe. This resentment toward referee Kessler appears only to have grown more entrenched. By the time of a recorded interview with Peter Heller, in October, 1970, Archie had this to say: "(Kessler) had no business refereeing that match because he was too excitable. He didn't know what to do...He grabbed Marciano's gloves and began to wipe Marciano's gloves and look over his shoulder...I'll never forget it. It cost me the heavyweight title." This grudge, however, was not mutual. In his own autobiography, Harry Kessler indeed recounts Marciano-Moore with a great excitement, frequently employing exclamation marks in his punctuation, going so far as a direct comparison to the donnybrook between Jack Dempsey and Luis Firpo.  Yet, the third man is evenhanded in his praise, taking time over most of a chapter on the bout, to laud Moore. His praise for Moore include the following quotes: "Archie had exuded a stalwart confidence from his training camp..." "Archie Moore had more punches in his arsenal than Robin Hood and all his Merry Men had arrows in their quivers..." "Archie Moore was probably as sure a fighter as ever set foot in the ring..." "No one ever questioned Archie Moore's courage...". As for the knockdown, described here also in detail, Kessler offers a perspective directly contradicting Moore's, saying "I didn't bother to wipe Marciano's gloves on my shirt before I waved them back to combat; that early in the drama, there was no resin on the canvas." As opposed to any blind rage, Kessler states that "Archie hesitated a couple of seconds before he came in."  With humor and without malice, Kessler even recounts the 41-year-old Moore poo-pooing any talk of retirement at the postfight press conference, then sitting in on bass fiddle at a hotspot in Greenwich Village until 5 a.m.!  Examination of the original, uncut closed circuit broadcast from 1955, shows no excesses in referee involvement. Marciano arises at "two", but the voice of Al Berl, assigned the counting for knockdowns, continues to "four". In harmony with Archie's further 1960 description, Marciano has moved to the ropes and rests an elbow. Moore is already moving toward him. Kessler flashes onscreen quickly, then away again, as though he had meant to separate the fighters. He is perpendicular to Marciano's chest, and his right hand waves rapidly near Rocky's left glove. Kessler reverses out as fast as he has come into frame, with no wiping of Marciano's gloves, and the action resumes. Marciano recovered, and went on to knock Moore down five times, finally knocking him out in the ninth to retain the belt. It was Marciano's sixth and last title defense, before retiring in 1956.  In 1956, Moore fought mostly as a heavyweight but did retain his Light Heavyweight title with a ten-round knockout over Yolande Pompey in London. He won 11 bouts in a row before challenging again for the World Heavyweight Championship. The title was left vacant by Marciano, but Moore lost to Floyd Patterson by a knockout in five (Patterson, yet another future Hall of Famer, himself made history that night, becoming, at the age of 21, the youngest World Heavyweight Champion yet, a record he would hold until 1986). Moore won all six of his bouts during 1957. Among those wins was an easy 10-round decision over heavyweight contender Hans Kalbfell in Germany, a knockout in 7 rounds over highly ranked Tony Anthony to retain the light heavyweight title, a one-sided 10-round decision over light heavyweight contender Eddie Cotton in a non-title bout and a 4th-round knockout of future top ten heavyweight contender Roger Rischer. In 1958, Moore had 10 fights, going 9–0–1 during that span. His fight with Yvon Durelle in particular was of note: defending his world light heavyweight title in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, he was felled three times in round one, and once again in round five, but then dropped Durelle in round 10 and won by a knockout in the 11th. 1959, his last full year as uncontested champion, was another rare low-profile year; in his two fights, he beat Sterling Davis by a knockout in three, and then Durelle again, also by a knockout in three, to once again retain his World Light Heavyweight title. In 1960, Moore was stripped of his World Light Heavyweight title by the National Boxing Association (NBA), but continued to be recognized by most major boxing authorities including the New York State Athletic Commission and The Ring Magazine. Moore won three of his four bouts in 1960, one by decision against Buddy Turman in Dallas, his lone loss coming in a ten-round decision versus Giulio Rinaldi in Rome. In 1961, he defeated Turman again by decision in Manila, Philippines before defending his Lineal World Light Heavyweight Championship for what would be the last time, beating Rinaldi by a 15-round decision to retain the belt. In his last fight that year, he once again ventured into the heavyweights, and met Pete Rademacher, a man who had made history earlier in his career by becoming the first man ever to challenge for a world title in his first professional bout (when he lost to Patterson by a knockout in six). Moore beat Rademacher by a knockout in nine. In 1962, the remaining boxing commissions that had continued to back Moore as the World Light Heavyweight Champion withdrew their recognition. He campaigned exclusively as a heavyweight from then on, and beat Alejandro Lavorante by a knockout in 10 and Howard King by a knockout in one round in Tijuana. He then drew against future World Light Heavyweight Champion Willie Pastrano in a 10-round heavyweight contest. On the posters advertising that fight, Moore was billed as the "World Light Heavyweight Champion." The bout took place in California, which had not yet withdrawn recognition from Moore at the time the Moore-Pastrano fight was signed. By the time the bout took place, the California commission, like New York, Massachusetts, the EBU and Ring Magazine, had recognized Harold Johnson, who had beaten Doug Jones 16 days earlier, as the new Light Heavyweight Champion. Johnson had reigned as the NBA (WBA) Champion since February 7, 1961. Then, in his last fight of note, the 49 year-old Moore faced a young heavyweight out of Louisville named Cassius Clay (Muhammad Ali). Moore had been Clay's trainer for a time, but Clay became dissatisfied and left Moore because of Moore's attempts to change his style and his insistence that Clay do dishes and help clean gym floors. In the days before the fight, Clay had rhymed that "Archie Moore...Must fall in four."  Moore replied that he had perfected a new punch for the match: The Lip-Buttoner. Nonetheless, as Clay predicted, Moore was beaten by a knockout in four rounds. Moore is the only man to have faced both Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali. After one more fight in 1963, a third-round knockout win over Mike DiBiase in Phoenix, Moore announced his retirement from boxing, for good.  Post-retirement Despite retiring, Moore couldn't escape the limelight, and received numerous awards and dedications. In 1965, he was given the key to the city of San Diego, California. In 1970, he was named "Man of The Year" by Listen Magazine, and received the key to the city of Sandpoint, Idaho. He was elected in 1985 to the St. Louis city Boxing Hall of Fame and he received the Rocky Marciano Memorial Award in the city of New York in 1988. In 1990, he became a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York, being one of the original members of that institution. At one point the oldest boxer to win the World's Light Heavyweight Championship, he is believed to have been the only boxer who boxed professionally in the eras of Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali. He is one of only a handful of boxers whose careers spanned four decades, retiring with a final record of 185 wins, 23 losses, 11 draws and 1 no contest, with 131 official knockouts. However, at least three of Moore's 131 knockouts came in less-than-competitive matches against pro wrestlers: "Professor" Roy Shire in 1956, Sterling Davis in 1959 and Mike DiBiase in 1963 (Moore's 131st and final knockout). All three matches are officially listed as third-round TKO stoppages. The second-highest amount of knockouts in boxing history is 128, which belongs to Sam Langford . During the 1960s he founded an organization called Any Boy Can, which taught boxing to underprivileged youth in the San Diego area. In 1974 he helped train heavyweight boxer George Foreman for his famous "Rumble in the Jungle" title bout in Zaire against Muhammad Ali. In 1976 he served as an assistant coach for the Nigerian Olympic boxing team. Actively involved in efforts to teach children about the dangers of drug abuse, he worked during the 1980s as a youth boxing instructor for the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, assigned largely to ghettos in San Diego and Los Angeles. "I try to pass on the arts I know: self-control, self-reliance, self-defense," he told a reporter. In the early 1990s he again worked as a trainer for George Foreman.  Acting career In 1960, Moore was chosen to play the role of the runaway slave Jim in Michael Curtiz's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, based on the Mark Twain novel, opposite Eddie Hodges as Huck. Moore garnered positive reviews for his sympathetic portrayal of Jim, which some viewers still consider the best interpretation of this much-filmed role. Moore did not choose to pursue a full-time career as an actor, but he did appear in films such as The Carpetbaggers (1964), The Hanged Man (1964) and The Fortune Cookie (1966), and on television in episodes of Family Affair, Perry Mason, Wagon Train, The Reporter, Batman (episode 35)  and the soap opera One Life to Live. He also appeared in the critically acclaimed TV movie My Sweet Charlie.  His later film appearances included the crime film The Outfit (1973), as a chef in Breakheart Pass (1975) with Charles Bronson, and a cameo role as himself in the 1982 film Penitentiary II, along with Leon Isaac Kennedy and Mr. T.  Humanitarian Boxing took Moore all over the world as a fighter, a civil rights activist, and a leader in the fight to influence the minds of the nation's youth. He arrived in Argentina in June 1951 for a rematch with the champion Abel Cestac. Moore's victory made headlines and caught the attention of the Argentinian President Juan Perón and his wife Eva for his selfless act helping children, buying them shoes, clothing, and building their confidence. Moore was invited to stay in Argentina and accept an appointment as the Minister of Welfare of Children. He declined the offer to continue his road to winning title fights. In 1957, Moore founded Any Boy Can, a non-profit organization based in San Diego, California. ABC, as it was known, provides services to all who seek help regardless of age, race, creed, religion or national origin. Moore stated that the mission of ABC is to help the youth to "step off in life with their best foot forward." The students were taught good sportsmanship, respect, and confidence. They were instructed to look a person in the eye and give them a firm handshake. They addressed him as Instructor Moore. Word traveled fast about Moore's ABC program. He was invited to Jamaica and sponsored by the Jamaican Boxing Board of Control to train boys for the Olympics. He trained 600 boys using his ABC methods. In 1968, the ABC Foundation received the Freedom Foundation's Patriotism Award, a special citation for providing a challenge for youth to become contributing members of their communities and upholding the ideals and ideas that were present at the founding of our great nation. This recognition is one of many. Based on his work with the youth, in 1981, Moore became the Presidential Appointee of Ronald Reagan to work under Samuel R. Pierce, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Under the national heading, Project Build, Moore taught boxing to underprivileged youth in and around the housing projects in California. Moore applied the philosophy and mechanics of his ABC program and until his death, he believed that "Any Body Can."  Personal life Archie Moore had three daughters, Reena, J'Marie and Elizabeth Moore-Stump, and four sons, Archie Jr., Hardy, Anthony and D'Angelo.  The marriage of Archie Moore and Elizabeth Thorton produced Archie Jr. and Elizabeth. In 1956, he married Joan Hardy and had five children: Reena, J'Marie, Hardy, Anthony and D'Angelo. They were married until his death in 1998. Moore joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church later in life. In 1997, J'Marie Moore became the first daughter of a famous boxer to herself become a professional boxer.  Death Archie Moore died of heart failure in 1998. He was cremated and is interred in a niche at Cypress View Mausoleum and Crematory, in San Diego.  Filmography Legacy In 1965, Moore was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame. In 1980, he was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame. In 1990, he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. In 2002, Archie Moore was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. In 2006, Moore was inducted into the California Boxing Hall of Fame. The Ring ranked Moore #4 on its "Best Punchers of all time" list in 2003 and #14 on its list of the "80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years." Moore was ranked as the #1 light heavyweight of all time by the International Boxing Research Organization in 2005. Moore was voted as the #1 light heavyweight of the 20th century by the Associated Press in 1999. Moore is rated the number sixth pound for pound fighter of all time by Boxrec.

This is a cumulative list of previously used tropical cyclone (tropical storm and hurricane) names which have been permanently removed from reuse in the North Atlantic basin. As of 2024, 96 storm names have been retired. The naming of North Atlantic tropical cyclones is currently under the oversight of the Hurricane Committee of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). This group maintains six alphabetic lists of twenty-one names, with one list used each year. This normally results in each name being reused every six years. However, in the case of a particularly deadly or damaging storm, that storm's name is retired, and a replacement starting with the same letter is selected to take its place. The decision whether to remove a name in a given season is made at the annual session of the WMO Hurricane Committee in the spring of the following year. The practice of retiring storm names was begun by the United States Weather Bureau in 1955, after major hurricanes Carol, Edna, and Hazel struck the Northeastern United States during the previous year. Initially their names were retired for 10 years, after which time they could be reintroduced; however, in 1969, the policy was changed to have the names retired permanently. In 1977, the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) transferred control of the naming lists to the Hurricane Committee. Since the formal start of naming during the 1947 Atlantic hurricane season, an average of one Atlantic storm name has been retired each year, though many seasons (most recently 2023) did not have any names retired. The record for number of storm names retired from a single season is five, held by the 2005 season. The most names retired for a decade was 24 in the 2000s, followed by the 16 retirements resulting from hurricanes in the 2010s. The deadliest storm to have its name retired was Hurricane Mitch, which caused over 10,000 fatalities when it struck Central America during October 1998. The costliest storms were hurricanes Katrina in August 2005 and Harvey in August 2017; each storm struck the U.S. Gulf Coast, causing $125 billion in damage, much of it from flooding. The most recent North Atlantic names to be retired were Fiona and Ian following the 2022 season.  Background By 1947, tropical cyclones developing in the North Atlantic Ocean were named by the United States Army Air Forces in private communications between weather centers and aircraft using the phonetic alphabet. This practice continued until September 1950, when the names started to be used publicly after three hurricanes (Baker, Dog, Easy) had occurred simultaneously and caused confusion within the media and the public. Public use of the phonetic alphabet continued until the 1953 Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, where the decision was made to start using a new list of female names during that season, as a second phonetic alphabet had been developed. During the active but mild 1953 Atlantic hurricane season, the names were readily used in the press with few objections recorded; as a result, the same names were reused during the next year with only one change: Gilda for Gail. Over the next six years a new list of names was developed ahead of each season, before in 1960 forecasters developed four alphabetical sets and repeated them every four years. These new sets followed the example of the typhoon names and excluded names beginning with the letters Q, U, X, Y, and Z, and keeping them to female names only. In 1955, it was decided to start retiring the names of significant tropical cyclones for 10 years after which they might be reintroduced, with the names Carol and Edna reintroduced ahead of the 1965 and 1968 hurricane seasons respectively. At the 1969 Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference the naming lists were revised after it was decided that the names Carol, Edna and Hazel would be permanently retired because of their importance to the research community. It was also decided that any significant hurricane in the future would also be permanently retired. Ahead of the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season, 10 lists of hurricane names were inaugurated, by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In 1977 it was decided that the World Meteorological Organization's Hurricane Committee (WMO) would control the names used, who subsequently decided that six lists of names would be used in the Atlantic Ocean from 1979 onwards with male names included. Since 1979 the same six lists have been used by the United States National Hurricane Center (NHC) to name systems, with names of significant tropical cyclones retired from the lists permanently and replaced with new names as required at the following year's hurricane committee meeting. At present, the name of any tropical cyclone may be retired or withdrawn from the list of names at the request of a member state, if it acquires notoriety for various reasons including the number of deaths, amount of damages or other impacts. The committee subsequently discuss the proposal and either through building consensus or a majority vote decides if the name should be retired or withdrawn. In March 2017, members of the British Caribbean Territories proposed that a third retirement criterion be added: the tropical cyclone must have sustained winds of at least 96 mph (154 km/h). This came in light of the retirement of Tropical Storm Erika in 2015 which caused catastrophic flooding and mudslides in Dominica without producing sustained tropical storm-force winds on the island. No action has been taken on this proposal yet. Formerly, if a season's primary list of names was fully used, subsequent storms would be assigned names based on the letters of the Greek alphabet. According to the WMO's initial policy established in 2006, Greek-letter named storms could never be retired, "lest an irreplaceable chunk be taken out of the alphabet." Therefore, devastating 2020 hurricanes Eta and Iota would have been retired as "Eta 2020" and "Iota 2020" respectively, but the letter names themselves would remain available for use whenever Greek alphabet letter names were needed again in subsequent years. However, this plan was never implemented, as the names Eta and Iota were both formally retired without the year descriptor by the WMO in 2021. The organization also abandoned the Greek alphabet auxiliary list in favor of a new auxiliary naming list.  Names retired in the 1950s Between 1954 and 1959, eight names were deemed significant enough to be retired for 10 years due to their impact, before being permanently retired after 1969. There were no names retired for the 1956, 1958, and 1959 seasons. Collectively, these storms resulted in at least 2947 fatalities and over $2.04 billion in damage. The deadliest hurricane was Hurricane Hazel, which killed at least 1,191 people, while the costliest was Hurricane Diane, which caused US$831 million in damage.  Names retired in the 1960s In 1960, four rotating lists of names were developed to avoid having to create new lists each year, while the practice of retiring any particularly damaging storm names for 10 years continued, with 11 names deemed significant enough to be retired during the decade. At the 1969 Hurricane Warning Conference, the National Hurricane Center requested that Carol, Edna, Hazel, and Inez be permanently retired due to their importance to the research community. This request was subsequently accepted and led to today's practice of retiring names of significant tropical cyclones permanently. There were no names retired for the 1962 and 1968 seasons. Collectively, the 11 systems were responsible for at least 9841 fatalities and in excess of $6.13 billion in damage.  Names retired in the 1970s Starting in 1979, the WMO began assigning both male and female names to tropical cyclones. This decade featured hurricanes David and Frederic, the first male Atlantic hurricane names to be retired. During this decade, 9 storms were deemed significant enough to have their names retired. Together these 9 systems caused at least $9.41 billion in damage, while at least 10527 people lost their lives. There were no names retired for the 1971, 1973, and 1976 seasons.  Names retired in the 1980s After control of naming of hurricanes was turned over to the WMO's Hurricane Committee during the mid-1970s, the 1980s marked the least prolific decade in terms of the number of retired storms with 7 names warranting removal. Between them the 7 systems caused over $23.1 billion in damage while over 891 people lost their lives. Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense tropical cyclone during the decade by pressure, with a minimum value of 888 hPa (26.22 inHg). This was the lowest recorded pressure in a North Atlantic hurricane until Hurricane Wilma surpassed it during 2005. In addition, Hurricane Allen was the most intense tropical cyclone during the decade by wind speed, with maximum 1–minute sustained winds of 190 mph (305 km/h). This remains the highest sustained wind speed of any Atlantic hurricane on record. There were no names retired for the 1981, 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1987 seasons, which was the most of any decade since the introduction of the practice of retiring hurricane names.  Names retired in the 1990s During the 1990s, the Atlantic Ocean moved into its active era, which led to more tropical cyclones forming during the hurricane seasons. The decade featured Hurricane Andrew which at the time was the costliest hurricane on record, and also Hurricane Mitch which is considered to be the deadliest tropical cyclone to have its name retired, killing over 11,000 people in Central America. A total of 15 names were retired in this decade, with seven of those during the 1995 and 1996 seasons. Cumulatively, the 15 systems caused over $68 billion in damage while over 20470 people lost their lives. There were no names retired for the 1993, 1994 and 1997 seasons.  Names retired in the 2000s After the Atlantic basin had moved into the warm phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation during the mid-1990s, the 2000s marked the most prolific decade in terms of the number of retired storms, with 24 names warranting removal. The decade featured one of the costliest tropical cyclones on record, Hurricane Katrina, which inflicted roughly US$125 billion in damage across the Gulf Coast of the United States. Katrina was also the deadliest hurricane to strike the United States since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane. After stalling over and flooding southeastern Texas, and causing approximately US$9 billion in damage, Tropical Storm Allison became the first tropical storm in this basin to have its name retired, while subtropical storms started to be named during 2002. Hurricane Jeanne was the deadliest storm during the decade and was responsible for over 3,000 deaths, when it impacted Haiti and other parts of the Caribbean as a tropical storm and minimal hurricane. During October 2005, Hurricane Wilma became the most intense tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin on record, with a central pressure of 882 hPa (26.05 inHg). There were no names retired for the 2006 and 2009 seasons. Collectively, the 24 systems were responsible for nearly 7,900 fatalities and in excess of US$300 billion in damage.  Names retired in the 2010s Some of the most devastating hurricanes to hit the United States in recorded history did so in the 2010s, a decade in which 30 named storms were classified as major hurricanes (out of 152 named storms). Altogether, 16 tropical cyclone names were retired during the 2010s. Collectively, these systems killed at least 4630 people and caused at least $450 billion worth of damage. Among them, Hurricane Maria was the most intense tropical cyclone by pressure, with a minimum value of 908 hPa (26.81 inHg), as well as the deadliest, with 3,057 fatalities directly or indirectly caused by Maria. Hurricane Dorian was the most intense in terms of wind speed, with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 km/h). Hurricane Harvey was the decade's costliest system, as well as the costliest overall, tied with 2005's Katrina. There were no names retired for the 2014 season.  Names retired in the 2020s Six tropical cyclone names have been retired so far in the 2020s. Hurricane Laura was the costliest hurricane of the 2020 season, causing over $23 billion in damages, much of which occurred along the southwestern Louisiana coast as a result of its 18 ft (5.5 m) storm surge. Hurricanes Eta and  Iota both made landfall in Nicaragua, with Iota doing so with maximum sustained winds near 145 mph (233 km/h). Each brought torrential rain and then flooding to much of Central America. Hurricane Ida made landfall in southeastern Louisiana with sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h); the costliest hurricane of the 2021 season, Ida caused $75 billion damage and directly caused 55 deaths from the southeastern United States to New England. Hurricane Fiona caused major devastation to the islands in the Caribbean Sea and was the most intense storm by barometric pressure to strike Atlantic Canada. Hurricane Ian was the third-costliest tropical cyclone on record, only behind hurricanes Katrina and Harvey in 2005 and 2017, respectively. Ian made landfall in western Florida and devastated the state before losing hurricane strength. Thereafter, Ian entered the Atlantic Ocean, intensifying to Category 1 strength, and hit the coast of South Carolina. There were no names retired for the 2023 season.

"Bo le lavabo (WC Kiss)" is a 1990 novelty song recorded by the French TV presenter and humorist Lagaf'. It was his debut single and achieved success in France.  Background and writing In one of his sketches, French humorist Vincent Lagaf' (Vincent Rouil), who featured on several TV programs in the 1980s and 1990s, commented on how easy it was to produce a hit single during the house period, as the repetitive music distracts the audience from the words, reduced to a bare and trivial content. As the sketch had a great success, he decided to release it as an unpretentious but ironic single, built with deliberately very poor lyrics: in the song, Lagaf' explains that, to produce a hit every year, it is enough to barely change the words: the first year, he can sing "il est beau le lavabo" ("the sink is beautiful"), the second year, "il est laid le bidet" ("the bidet is ugly"), and the third year, he mixes both versions. The music uses a sample recorded by Lil Louis from his song "French Kiss", which was released in 1989. After this unexpected success, Lagaf' released a new single the following year, "La Zoubida", which was even more successful than "Bo le lavabo (WC Kiss)", as it was number one for 11 weeks.  Chart performances In France, "Bo le lavabo (WC Kiss)" debuted at number 40 of the chart edition of 24 March 1990, then climbed regularly on the chart and eventually reached number one in its 13th week, dislodging Elton John's hit "Sacrifice", but was replaced the next week at this position by Zouk Machine's summer hit "Maldòn' (la musique dans la peau)". It cumulated 18 weeks in the top ten and fell off the top 50 after 28 weeks. The single was certified Gold disc by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique, the French certificator, for 400,000 units. On the European Hot 100 Singles, "Bo le lavabo (WC Kiss)" charted for 24 weeks, nine of them in the top 20. It debuted at number 81 on 28 April 1990 and reached number seven in its tenth week of presence.

The Rock Carvings in Tanum (Swedish: Hällristningsområdet i Tanum) are a collection of petroglyphs near Tanumshede, Bohuslän, Sweden, which were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994 because of their high concentration.  Petroglyphs In total, there are thousands of images called the Tanum petroglyphs, on about 600 panels within the World Heritage Area. These are concentrated in distinct areas along a 25 km stretch, and covers an area of about 51 hectares (126 acres or 0.5 km2). While the region was on the coastline when the drawings were made, it is now at an elevation of 25m. Scandinavian Bronze Age and Iron Age people were sophisticated craftsmen and very competent travelers by water. (Dates for ages vary with the region; in Scandinavia, the Bronze Age is roughly 1800 to 500 BCE) Many of the glyphs depict boats of which some seem to be of the Hjortspring boat type carrying around a dozen passengers. Wagons or carts are also depicted. Other glyphs depict humans with a bow, spear or axe, and others depict hunting scenes. In all cases the pictures show people performing rituals. There is a human at a plough drawn by two oxen, holding what might be a branch or an ox-goading crop made of a number of strips of hide. One of the larger rocks of Nordic Bronze Age petroglyphs in Scandinavia (at 22 metres tall and 6 metres wide), the Vitlyckehäll, is located in Tanumshede. It contains nearly 300 carvings of a variety of scenes, people, and objects. The rock carvings are endangered by erosion due to acid rain and some are thus covered either permanently or during certain times of the year. Some have been painted red to make them more visible for tourists; a practice which has drawn criticism for removing the authenticity and original state of the drawings.  Recent history The first records of the images inscribed at the site were made in 1627 when Peder Alfsön, a Norwegian doctor and lector, made ink drawings of some of the carvings. The first professional recordings were made in 1792 by Carl Gustaf Gottfried Hilfeling, who was sent by nobleman Pehr Tham to draw the carvings. A number of excavations and recordings took place over the course of the early 19th century, primarily led by Carl Georg Brunius and Axel Emmanuel Holmberg, who published research and debated at length the most likely era of their creation. Strong arguments for the now accepted era were not made until the late 19th century, when Oscar Montelius and Viktor Rydberg presented evidence linking the drawings to the Bronze Age. During the early 20th century, studies began to focus more on the meaning behind the drawings, rather than determining their age, but late 20th century work confirmed that the drawings were likely made during the Bronze Age. The site was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994; encompassing approximately 45 km2 in total. It is visited by approximately 100,000 people per year, though visitors are not permitted to walk on or touch the drawings.

The St. Louis Eagles were a professional ice hockey team that played in the National Hockey League (NHL). Based in St. Louis, the Eagles played for only one year, the 1934–35 NHL season. The team was founded in 1883 as the Ottawa Senators, a successful independent team that joined the NHL as a charter member in 1917. From the mid-1920s onward, they endured financial strain caused, in part, by being in the NHL's smallest market. The financial problems forced the Senators to suspend operations for the 1931–32 season. Upon their return to play, having sold their better players in an effort to raise funds, the Senators finished in last place for two straight seasons and continued to lose money. Following the repeat last place finishes, the team decided that it could not survive in Ottawa and hoped to move to a bigger market. In an attempt to recoup losses and pay outstanding debts, the Senators moved to St. Louis as the Eagles. However, the team continued to lose money because of increased travel expenses, and it was forced to sell players to other teams to meet its financial obligations. After the season, the owners asked the NHL for permission to suspend operations for a second time. This time, the NHL refused the request. Instead, the league bought back the franchise, halted its operations, and dispersed its players among the remaining teams.  History The move from Ottawa The Ottawa Senators were founded in 1883 as an amateur club. They began paying their players "under the table" in 1903 and turned openly professional in 1907. They were a charter member of the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1917, and won the Stanley Cup four times in the NHL's first decade (and seven times prior to the league's formation – including their time as the Silver Seven). However, for the better part of their tenure in Ottawa, the Senators played in the smallest market in the NHL. The 1931 census listed only 110,000 people in the city of Ottawa—roughly one-fifth the size of Toronto, the league's second-smallest market. The team started having attendance problems when the NHL expanded to the United States in 1924; games against the new American teams did not draw well. Despite winning what would be its last Stanley Cup in 1927, the team lost $50,000 for the season. The Senators asked the NHL for permission to suspend operations for the 1931–32 season in order to help eliminate debt. The league granted the request. During their suspended season, Ottawa received $25,000 for the use of its players, while the NHL co-signed a Bank of Montreal loan of $28,000 for the franchise. The Senators returned for the 1932–33 season and finished in last place. They finished last again in 1933–34 season. After the season, the Ottawa Auditorium, owners of the Senators, announced that the team would be moving elsewhere for the next season due to losses of $60,000 over the previous two seasons. Auditorium officials said they needed to move the Senators to a larger city in order to protect the shareholders and pay off their debts. The Senators' owners decided to move the franchise to St. Louis, Missouri, and the transfer was approved by the league on May 14, 1934. Thomas Franklin Ahearn resigned as president of the Ottawa Auditorium and Redmond Quain became president. Quain transferred the players' contracts and franchise operations to a new company called the Hockey Association of St. Louis, Inc. Eddie Gerard was hired to coach the new team. The club was renamed the Eagles, inspired by the logo of the Anheuser-Busch brewing company, which was founded in St. Louis. The Senators name and logo remained in Ottawa and would be used by a senior amateur team until 1954. At the time, St. Louis was the seventh largest city in the United States, with over 800,000 inhabitants— over seven times larger than Ottawa. Despite this, St. Louis had been denied an NHL franchise in 1932 because travel to the Midwest was considered too expensive during the Great Depression. Even before the debut of the Eagles, a problem had arisen for the new NHL club. There was already a professional hockey team in the city, the St. Louis Flyers, playing in the minor-pro American Hockey Association (AHA). The owners of the Flyers claimed they had an agreement with the NHL which prevented it from settling west of the Mississippi. They threatened to sue for $200,000 in compensation as soon as the Eagles played their first game. Following a visit from the AHA President, the Flyers were asked not to go forward with the lawsuit. The Flyers did not pursue further legal action and eventually changed their home arena.  1934–35 season At the time there were nine teams in the NHL, divided into two divisions, the Canadian and American. Logically, the Eagles should have been placed in the American Division with the Boston Bruins, Chicago Black Hawks, New York Rangers and Detroit Red Wings. However, the Eagles retained the Senators' place in the Canadian Division alongside the Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Maroons, and New York Americans. The core of the Senators' players returned and the team played their games in the St. Louis Arena. The arena was built in 1929 to host the National Dairy Show, but had suffered financially. In 1931, an ice hockey rink was set up to attract new business. Once the Eagles began play the St. Louis Arena gained the distinction of being the only NHL stadium with racially segregated seating. In their first game the Eagles succumbed to a late rally by the defending Stanley Cup champion Black Hawks, losing 3–1. They registered their first win in the next game winning 4–2 over the Rangers. Following the win the Eagles went on an eight-game losing streak. After the first 13 games the Eagles posted a 2–11–0 record placing them last in their division. Gerard resigned as head coach and was replaced by George "Buck" Boucher, the coach that Gerard himself had replaced after the franchise's last season in Ottawa. Under Boucher's coaching the team showed improvement, posting a 3–3–3 record in the first nine games. However, the early losing streak had already damaged the fan base. Their inaugural game drew 12,622 fans, but attendance quickly diminished. In early January 1935 the team cut ticket prices to the lowest in the league in an attempt to bring out fans. By February the financial state of the team forced the Eagles to essentially sell leading goal scorer Syd Howe to the Detroit Red Wings. Officially, the trade broke down as such - Detroit received Howe and Ralph Bowman in exchange for Teddy Graham and $50,000. At the time it was considered a large sum of money. Likewise Frank Finnigan was sold to the Maple Leafs. The Eagles were unable to maintain the early success under Boucher, and finished with the worst record in the league for the third year in a row, with a record of 11–31–6. With only 84 goals scored, they were the lowest scoring team in the league. Only the Montreal Canadiens allowed more goals during the season, surrendering 145 to the Eagles' 144.  The end of the Eagles By season's end the Eagles ownership had lost $70,000, due primarily to the cost of train travel. In those days, NHL teams traveled primarily by rail. Due to being in the Canadian Division, the Eagles had to make many trips to Montreal and Toronto. An attempt to stabilize the franchise by selling off some of its players netted $58,000. The owners had hoped to move again to save the franchise. There was interest from Cleveland and also in a return to Ottawa, but neither came to fruition. As a result, the ownership again petitioned the NHL to allow them to suspend operations for a year. This time the NHL refused and the Eagles were put up for sale. After no credible offers surfaced, the NHL bought the franchise and player contracts for $40,000, and opted to play as an eight-team league. If the NHL ever resold the franchise, proceeds were to go to the Ottawa Hockey Association. The NHL distributed the players under contract with St. Louis through a dispersal draft. Teams selected players in an order based on the previous season's standings. Teams with the lowest point totals selected first. The Chicago Black Hawks did not participate in the draft. Eighteen of the 23 players under contract were selected with the remaining players being placed in the minor leagues. The players were distributed as follows:  New York Americans: Forwards: Pete Kelly, Eddie Finnigan Montreal Canadiens: Goaltender: Bill Beveridge, Defenseman: Irv Frew, Forwards: Paul Drouin, Henri Lauzon Detroit Red Wings: Forward: Carl Voss, Goaltender: William Peterkin New York Rangers: Forward: Glen Brydson, Defenseman: Vernon Ayres Montreal Maroons: Forward: Joe Lamb, Goaltender: Bill Taugher Boston Bruins: Forward: Bill Cowley, Defenseman: Teddy Graham Toronto Maple Leafs: Forwards: Gerry Shannon, Cliff Purpur, Jim Dewey, Defenseman: Mickey Blake No credible offers to purchase the dormant franchise ever surfaced. As a result, the Senators/Eagles franchise never took the ice again, and remain one of two NHL teams to fold after winning a Stanley Cup (the other being the Maroons). In 1938, the Montreal Maroons attempted to move to St. Louis. They were denied by the NHL due to the high travel costs that plagued the Eagles. The NHL returned to St. Louis in 1967, when the league doubled in size from the Original Six. The new team was named the Blues and they joined the Minnesota North Stars, Los Angeles Kings, Oakland Seals, Philadelphia Flyers, and Pittsburgh Penguins as part of the new expansion.  Final standings Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, GF = Goals For, GA = Goals Against, Pts = Points       Teams that qualified for the playoffs are highlighted in bold.  Players Twenty-nine players represented the Eagles during their lone season of existence. The last active player who played with the Eagles was Bill Cowley, who retired in 1947 after his final season with the Boston Bruins. He was also the only player in franchise history to start his career with the Eagles and be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Syd Howe was the only captain of the team during its existence and the two players were the only Eagles players to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Pete Kelly was the last surviving St. Louis Eagle, dying in 2004. Carl Voss led the team with 18 assists and 31 points Howe led them in goalscoring registering 14, despite being traded midway through the season. The totals were much lower than the NHL leaders as Charlie Conacher of Toronto led the league with 36 goals and 57 points, while Art Chapman of the Americans led for assists notching 34. Bill Beveridge was the only goaltender the team used during the season. Out of his 11 wins three were shutouts. The list of players in the history of the team is presented below.

DWDS (106.1 FM), on air as 106.1 Animo! FM, is a radio station owned and operated by De La Salle Lipa through its AB Communications Radio Guild. Its studio is located at room MB 408, 4th Floor, Mabini Building, De La Salle Lipa, 1962 J.P. Laurel National Highway, Tambo, Lipa, Batangas, with transmitter located at the 7th floor.  Station history 2008-09: Launch and transmitter problems DWDS was launched in June 2008 as a project of the Bachelor of Arts In Communication to gain an avenue for its students to test the radio medium for future employment. Plans for the station were already as early as 2007. Its inaugural slogan that ran until February 2018 was The Best Campus Radio You Love!. Currently, it has been relegated as a secondary slogan. In April 2009, however, technical problems caused the transmitter to bug down, causing the station to cease operations.  2010–present: Relaunch and developments The station was relaunched in August 2010 after a year of inactivity, However, problems still hound the station as it only employs one technical personnel and programming has become more irregular. Typhoon Glenda (Rammasun)'s onslaught forced the station to cease operations until October 2014. On February 8, 2017, 106.1 Animo! FM underwent technical maintenance, causing the station to go off-air until it returned on April 17, 2017. As part of its relaunch under new program manager April Rose Magpantay, it mirrored that of ALFM 95.9 Radyo Totoo by adding a religious programming block for its first 90 minutes after sign-on as The Daily Bread. Magpantay was succeeded in August 2017 by Rocelyn Fandiño. Upon the change of leadership, infotainment shows hosted by undergraduates were added in the grid outside the religious programming block. This arrangement under the academics lasted for three months until Camille da Silva was appointed for the 2nd semester of academic year 2017–2018. On February 26, 2018, the station discontinued its religious programming for undisclosed reasons. On March 9, 2018, it debuted its updated jingle and slogan, The Number One and Only One. Da Silva was succeeded as programming and Radio Guild head by CJ Andaya in July 2018. On September 3, 2018, the station inaugurated an expanded Christmas radio programming block branded as 106.1 Animo! FM Christmas Service, broadcasting twice to thrice per week from September to November until expanding to a weekday basis in December. Prior to the expansion, the station only used the format - albeit informal, annually every December. On February 15, 2019, the station underwent another phase of renovation with the procurement of a replacement antenna and new studio equipment as a part of the refurbishment of the AB Communications Laboratory. It resumed operations on August 6. Upon the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing distance learning initiatives in March 2020, the station reduced its operations through twice a week broadcasts of music and pre-recorded "CommTapes" podcast series produced by the students with a possible return to pre-pandemic status quo in 2023.  Area of coverage DWDS covers the entire campus of De La Salle Lipa and the west-central portion of Lipa City. With a good radio receiver, listeners as far east as Barangay Talisay and as far south as the Ibaan, Batangas toll plaza of the STAR Tollway can pick up a grade B coverage from its 10-watt (ERP of 30 watt) signal, powered by a Harris in-studio switcher.   == References ==

Limia islai, also known as the tiger limia, is a species of fish within the family Poeciliidae. This species is one of several Limia that are endemic to Lake Miragoâne, Haiti.  Description Limia islai can be distinguished by almost all other Limia species by the presence of black vertical stripes across the fishes body. The only other Limia species to possess a similar striping is Limia nigrofasciata. Stripes are present on both male and female members of L. islai. The number of stripes on an individual fish can vary between 4 and 12. Limia islai have slender bodies which are olive green in colour and fish possess yellow pigment in their snout and fins.  Distribution and habitat Limia islai is endemic to Haiti, where the species is restricted to the Tiburon Peninsula of Southwest Haiti. This species has only been recorded in the coastal Lake Miragoâne. The lake is freshwater and reaches a maximum depth of 45 meters. The habitat consists of aquatic vegetation and a muddy substrate.  Reproduction Unlike the similarly striped L. nigrofasciatata which mates via courtship, Limia islai will sneak up on their females in order to thrust their gonopodium into them and mate. Limia islai is a livebearer, which reproduces via internal fertilization and gives birth to live young. Mated females will release between 5 and 20 fry per pregnancy.  Etymology The word Limia is derived from the Latin word "limus", which means mud. This refers to a Limias feeding habit of searching through mud. The word Islai however is reference to the first person to introduce the species in the aquarium hobby, Dominic Isla.   == References ==

The United States Air Force's 72d Expeditionary Air Support Operations Squadron is a combat support unit located at an undisclosed location in the Middle East. The 72d provides tactical command and control of airpower assets for the Joint Forces Air Component Commander in support of the Joint Forces Land Component Commander in combat operations.  History Tactical Air Command The squadron was first activated in June 1969 at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida, when Tactical Air Command organized separate units for its mobile Combat Reporting Posts.  It drew its personnel and equipment from its parent squadron, the 4465th Tactical Control Squadron, which continued to operate a Combat Reporting Center.  In October, the 4465th was inactivated and transferred its mission, personnel and equipment to the 726th Tactical Control Squadron, which was simultaneously activated.  The flight continued this mission from several bases in the eastern United States until inactivating in March 1988.  Expeditionary unit In February 2009, the flight was renamed the 72d Expeditionary Air Support Operations Squadron, converted to provisional status, and assigned to Air Combat Command to activate or inactivate as needed.  Lineage Constituted as the 72d Tactical Control Flight on 24 June 1969 Activated on 25 June 1969 Inactivated on 31 March 1988 Redesignated 72d Expeditionary Air Support Operations Squadron and converted to provisional status on 12 February 2009  Assignments 4465th Tactical Control Squadron, 25 June 1969 726th Tactical Control Squadron, 15 October 1969 507th Tactical Air Control Wing, 1 May 1977 – 31 March 1988 Air Combat Command to activate or inactivate at any time on or after 12 Feb 2009  Stations Homestead Air Force Base, Florida, 25 June 1969 Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, 30 March 1972; Fort Monroe, Virginia, 30 June 1976 – 31 March 1988  References Notes  Bibliography  This article incorporates public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency  Mueller, Robert (1989).

Kinnauri is the most widely used language in Kinnaur. The languages have seen different nomenclatures in written literature. Kinnauri was mentioned as Kunawaree (Gerard 1842, Cunninham 1844), Kanauri (Konow 1905), Kanawari (Bailey 1909) and Kunawari (Grierson 1909). It is the language of upper caste in lower Kinnaur. It is also spoken in Moorang tehsil and, Ropa and Giabong villages in upper Kinnaur. It is a Sino-Tibetan dialect cluster centered on the Kinnaur district of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. Kaike, once thought to be Kinnauri, is closer to Tamangic. Bhoti Kinnauri and Tukpa (locally called Chhoyuli) are Bodish (Lahauli–Spiti).  Linguistic varieties and geographical distribution Kinnaur has nearly ten linguistic varieties, with Kinnauri being the major language. Ethnologue lists the following locations for Kinnauri proper and related languages. Kinnauri is spoken in the villages from Badhal Rampur Bushahr to Sangla and north along Satluj river to Morang. Mainly the Kinnauri-speaking area is located in lower parts of Kinnaur district in Himachal Pradesh. The estimated population of Kinnauri speaking people is 45,000.  Chitkuli Kinnauri is spoken by a thousand people in the Baspa river area of the Sangla valley in Nichar subdivision, Kinnaur district, Himachal Pradesh (in Chitkul and Rakchham villages). Jangshung is spoken in Morang tehsil, Kinnaur district, Himachal Pradesh (in Jangi, Lippa, and Asrang villages). These villages have a population of nearly 2600. Sumcho is spoken in Poo tehsil, Kinnaur district, Himachal Pradesh (in Kanam, Labrang, Spilo, Shyaso, Taling, and Rushkaling villages) by a population of 2500. Bhoti Kinnauri is spoken in Poo division of upper Kinnaur. The language shows slight phonemic variations in the valley. Main varieties are spoken in Poo Hangrang and Nako villages. It is a generic Tibetan language spoken by nearly 7000 people.   Chhoyuli is a Tibetic language spoken in Nesang and Kunnu Charan villages of Poo division in upper Kinnaur. It has a population of around 700. The language is considered a variety of Bhoti Kinnauri but is shows enough characteristics to stand as an independent language.  Sunnami language is spoken in Sunnam village of Poo division in upper Kinnaur. It has a population of about 700. Pahari Kinnauri is an Indo-Aryan language of Kinnaur spoken mainly by the Scheduled Caste community of Nichar, Kalpa, Sangla and    Moorang tehsils in Kinnaur. It has a population of 9000. In absence of a detailed sociolinguistic survey on language use, the actual number of fluent speakers of KLs is unknown. The actual number of speakers is much lower than the total population. Census data include native as well as the non native and the migratory workers in the survey.  Phonology This description is of the Pangi dialect of Kinnauri.  Consonants Note on palatals:  /dʒ/, /tʃ/,  /tʃʰ/, and /ʃ/ are post-alveolar. /ɲ/ is alveolo-palatal.  Vowels Kinnauri has six pairs of long/short vowels:  Syllables /h/, aspirated obstruents (i.e. /pʰ/, /tʰ/, /ʈʰ/, /kʰ/, /t͡sʰ/, /t͡ʃʰ/), and glides (i.e. /w/, /j/) do not occur in syllable codas.  All consonants may occur in onsets and word-medially. Kinnauri has the following types of syllables:  (C)V(C)(C)(C) CCV(C) CCCVC  Grammar Word order in Kinnari is SOV,, it is postpositional language, it shows agreement in person number features, adjective precedes head in the noun  phrase, modifiers precede the head noun, causative occurs after main verb, marker of comparison follows the standard of comparison, negatives are pre-verbal, auxiliary follows  the main verb, anaphor follows the antecedent and main clause precedes the subordinate clause. It exhibits some exceptions in SOV language features. SOV language should have  preposed genitives and adjective should follow noun. But Kinnauri has postpositional genitive and the adjective precedes the noun.  Script The language does not have a script. It is an oral language  Language vitality Kinnaura people are bilinguals who speak Hindi along with their mother tongue. Hindi is the main lingua franca for people from different language groups in Kinnaur. It is also the main language in schools, colleges, government offices, market place, banks and more such domains. Younger generation is exposed to entertainment media like movies, music, mobile phone, newspapers etc., in Hindi. Kinnauri songs beings produced show heavy influence of Hindi. Young learners are encouraged to learn and speak Hindi in order to benefit in education and employment in future. Fluent speakers of Kinnauri are only the elders or the mid aged people who have little exposure to the outer world or are still unaffected by the modernity. But whether the next generation will inherit the cultural knowledge or the legacy of ancestors is doubted. From UNESCO factors study, all languages in Kinnaur region are definitely endangered, inter-generational transmission is unsafe, number of speakers using Kinnauri as first language is very low, domains are shifting, Hindi is replacing Kinnauri in most domains, there is lack of literary traditions,  government support towards the protection and promotion of Kinnaur language or culture is absent, very little is known about the linguistic structure of the languages in the region. Like other tribal languages, Kinnauri too may lose much of its linguistic characteristics due to lack of proper documentation and government support and community apathy as well. Among urgent measures, Kinnauri languages need community collaborative efforts to document and discuss among the locals, scholars, linguists and researchers.

Játningar mjólkurfernuskálds ('confessions of a milk-carton poet') is the first novel by Arndís Þórarinsdóttir, published in Reykjavík by Mál og menning in 2011. It was nominated for the 2013 Nordic Children's Book Prize. The title refers to the Icelandic custom of publishing children's poems on the side of milk cartons; the main character of the novel has been published in this way, and it marks her as a goody two-shoes and overachiever.  Summary The novel is a first-person story of Halla, who is the daughter of a gay male couple, Aðalsteinn and Tryggvi. She is 13, from the affluent Vesturbær district of Reykjavík, doing spectacularly well in her studies, given to wearing pink, and popular among her classmates. However, she is caught in possession of cannabis and expelled from her school and abandoned by her old friends, most prominently her best friend Jenný. Meanwhile, the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis means that her family has to move to her aunt Salóme's house in a working-class district, where Halla starts in a new school. Labelled as a troublemaker at her new school, not least by her maths teacher Björgvinur and the local alpha-female Bára Sif, who bullies Halla and emerges as the book's main antagonist, Halla decides to live up to the label and be a 'vandræðaunglingur' (teenage delinquent). She shaves her head; endeavours to become friends with the Goth Anna Ninja and her friend Alexander Filippus, who, it emerges, suffers from depression; tries to start smoking; and concludes that she will not attend confirmation (a traditional and important rite of passage for Icelandic teenagers). However, Halla's nerdy tendencies are spotted by a popular and academically successful boy, Emil, who tries to convince her to compete on the school team for the TV quiz show Gettu betur. Halla fancies Emil and wants to participate, but is afraid to dilute her new, delinquent identity. As Halla explores her new situation, she starts to understand that she had perhaps been the Bára Sif of her previous school, a realisation which promotes her character development. Anna Ninja introduces Halla to the art of shoplifting in the shopping centre Smáralind, and also to a range of political issues: 'illegal distribution of copyrighted material on the Internet (in favor), the ban on head scarves in schools (opposed), gender quotas (in favor) and stem cell research (in favor)'. Halla's friendship with Anna Ninja is disrupted when Anna discovers that Halla has been lying about her identity and that she is a milk-carton poet. Emil supports Halla, and she explains to him that she only got involved in selling cannabis because Jenný's elder brother Leifur claimed it would raise money for his baby brother Ármann to receive medical treatment in the USA. Shortly after this, however, she discovers that Leifur has been arrested and was in fact dealing for his own gain. She confesses the story to her parents and in the knowledge that her name has been cleared attempts to return to her former milk-carton poet identity, agreeing to compete in Gettu betur. The school wins, to Halla's delight. Jenný renews her friendship with Halla and looks forward to attending confirmation. But Halla finds that she cannot readily return to her previous identity, and Anna Ninja mocks her for her theologically inconsistent about-turn on attending confirmation. The resolution of the novel comes when Halla discovers that Anna Ninja and Alexander are planning to protest at the general awfulness of the world by throwing paint at politicians. She is at Emil's at the time, and is shortly to be visited by Jenný. Halla realises that this protest is both too vague and too violent to achieve a useful outcome and eventually convinces Anna and Alexander, along with Emil, to come to her house, where they meet Jenný. Halla is thus able to draw together her different friends in a common purpose, distilling her own new sense of self. Halla leads the group in deciding to paint a huge banner to hang on the parliament building in an act of civil disobedience, protesting on themes close to their hearts: Reykjavík's children's hospital, Chad's fourth civil war, child obesity and economically stressed parents' excessive reliance on daycare services, and poor support for children with mental health problems. Early the next morning, the children hang the banner on the building and tip off the press. An epilogue explains that Halla decides not to take confirmation on theological grounds, but attends as an audience member in celebration of her friends' confirmation. It emerges that the banner enjoys international media coverage; provokes parliamentary debates on the situation of children in Iceland and the situation in Chad; and fetches up in the National Gallery of Iceland.

Tha Myat (Burmese: သာမြတ်, pronounced [θà mjaʔ]; 29 April 1899 – 24 November 1977) was a linguist, known for his works on writing systems of Burma (Myanmar), notably on the Pyu language.  Early life Tha Myat was born on 29 April 1899 to a merchant family of Ngwe Thin (ငွေသင်) and Po Mya (ဘိုးမြ) in Padigon. He studied at his local monastery until 12 before leaving for Gyobingauk to continue schooling at R.C.M. St. Michael's School. There, during summer holidays, he studied Hindi reading and writing from an Indian man. After completing 7th Standard, he then went on to study at Prome High School in Pyay. He passed the university matriculation examination with honors in English, Burmese and Pali. Then, he studied at Government College. In 1921, he finished intermediate college with honors, and received a scholarship to further study at Pune Agricultural College, then an affiliate college of the University of Bombay. He married Me Yee, daughter of Lu and Se, before leaving for India. He read agricultural economics and intensive farming, graduating with a bachelor's degree in agriculture in 1924. He received F.R.H.S. and M.R.Ag.S. degrees from the Royal Horticultural Society, London.  Career Upon his return from India in 1924, he joined the Department of Agriculture. He served as Agricultural Deputy Commissioner of Magway Division for 14 years. It was there that he began to take interest in the Burmese language, and began researching on the language. In 1954, he retired as Director of Dekkhina Circle, and became the Director of Cultural Institute, Rangoon. In that same year, he was awarded the Thiri Pyanchi Gold Medal by the government. On 23 December 1957, he received an honorary degree from Rangoon University. Throughout the 1950s, Tha Myat represented the country at a number of state missions to several countries, including India, Pakistan, the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, East Germany, West Germany, Britain, France, Yugoslavia, Italy and Egypt.  Associations Tha Myat was a member of Thukhamein team of the Burma Translation Society. In 1953, he was vice president of the Burma Science Association. In 1958, he became president of the Burma-India Culture Association and a member of the council of University for Adult Education.

Lambdopsalis is an extinct multituberculate mammal from the Late Paleocene of China and Mongolia. It is placed within the suborder Cimolodonta and is a member of the superfamily Taeniolabidoidea. Fossil remains have been found in the Late Paleocene Nomogen and Khashat Formations in Nao-mugen and Bayn Ulan of China and Mongolia, dated to 59-55 million years ago from the Thanetian age. Lambdopsalis bulla is the type species of this genus.  The genus and species were named by Chow and Tao Qi in 1978.   Hair and fur fossilize very infrequently, if at all. This genus of multituberculate mammals provides one of the earliest unequivocal examples of mammal fur (Lower Cretaceous fossils of Eomaia, Volaticotherium and Castorocauda with the fur preserved still attached are currently the oldest). Indirect evidence suggest that hair first appeared on non-mammalian therapsids (Therapsida), back in the Triassic or even earlier. This is inferred from small hollows on the bone of the snout similar to holes in the skulls of cats which provide space for concentrations of nerves and blood vessels that innervate prominent whiskers (specialized hairs). This adaptation allows cats to use their whiskers as effective tactile sensory organs. In the same Upper Paleocene strata, exceptionally preserved coprolites, originally excreted by unknown carnivorous animals, were discovered to contain undigested remains, including hair from Lambdopsalis and three other different mammal taxa. Studies on its tooth prism and enamel patterns have been performed. It had deciduous enamel, and there is evidence that adults and juveniles had substantially different diets. Cervical vertebrae C2-C3 or C2-C3-C4 appear to be typically fused in individuals of this genus.   Based on its robust humerus bones, its flat skull, its fused and stiff neck bones, and thick enamel on its lower incisors, it is believed that this genus was either partially or fully adapted to a burrowing (fossorial) lifestyle. Kielan-Jaworowska and Qi suggest similar locomotive behavior to the modern Golden mole. Fully grown L.bulla individuals were estimated to have had a body mass of 0.78 kilograms (1.7 lb) and skull length of about 60.8 millimetres (2.39 in).  Notes References Chow & Qi, Tao (1978).

The Brown Hills (79°46′S 158°33′E) are a group of mainly snow-free hills in the Cook Mountains of Antarctica.  Location The Brown Hills lie north of the lower reaches of Darwin Glacier. They are north of Diamond Hill and are adjacent to Diamond Glacier, a distributary of the Darwin Glacier. To the east they are bordered by the Ross Ice Shelf. On the west side, the Touchdown Glacier flows south to the Darwin Glacier between Roadend Nunatak and the Brown Hills. Reeves Bluffs are to the north of the hills. The hills were named for their color by the Darwin Glacier Party of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1956–58).  Geology During glacial periods, Diamond Glacier would probably have flowed over the Brown Hills to the Ross Ice Shelf. Exposure ages of five glacial erratics from the Brown Hills range from 7,000 to 205,000 years ago, which implies that until 7,000 years ago the Brown Hills saddle was ice-covered. Simpson 2002 proposes that the Darwin calcic suite, a K-series, I-type, volcanic arc granitoid, includes the Carlyon Granitoid among other rock types.  The Brown Hills are mostly made up of the Carlyon Granitoid, which includes an variably foliated, biotite-hornblende granodiorite and granite.  Glaciers Bartrum Glacier 79°44′S 158°44′E. A small steeply crevassed glacier in the Brown Hills, flowing west between Bowling Green Plateau and Blank Peaks. Mapped by the VUWAE (1962-63). Named after J.A. Bartrum (1885-1949), Professor of Geology at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.  Foggydog Glacier 79°47′S 158°40′E A glacier between Blank Peaks and Mount Rich in the Brown Hills. Mapped by the VUWAE (1962-63) and so named because in plan the glacier is shaped like the head and neck of a dog, with a moraine suggesting a collar and a glacial lake in the position of the ears. Fog accumulated regularly over the glacier.  Features Bastion Hill 79°50′S 158°19′E. A prominent ice-free feature in the Brown Hills, rising to 1,490 metres (4,890 ft) and projecting southward into Darwin Glacier just east of Touchdown Glacier. The descriptive name was given by the Darwin Glacier Party of the CTAE (1956-58).  Mount Rich 79°47′S 158°48′E An isolated peak in the Brown Hills, 5 miles (8.0 km) northwest of Diamond Hill. Named by the VUWAE (1962-63) for Charles C. Rich, USARP geologist who served as deputy leader and geologist of the expedition.  Erewhon Basin 79°48′S 158°34′E.  An extensive ice-free area forming a basin in the Brown Hills separating the snouts of the Foggydog and Bartrum Glaciers from the northern edge of the Darwin Glacier.  Explored by the VUWAE, 1962-63, and named from Samuel Butler's novel Erewhon.  Goorkha Craters 79°45′S 159°34′E. A line of snow-free coastal hills 5 miles (8.0 km) long, standing 2 miles (3.2 km) east of Cooper Nunatak between Carlyon and Darwin Glaciers. Discovered and named by the BrNAE (1901-04).  Blank Peaks 79°45′S 158°45′E. A cluster of ice-free peaks occupying the isolated ridge between Bartrum and Foggydog Glaciers in the Brown Hills. Mapped by the VUWAE (1960-61) and named for H. Richard Blank, geologist with the expedition. Not: Blank Peninsula.  Bowling Green Plateau 79°42′S 158°36′E. A small but prominent ice-covered plateau at the north side of the Brown Hills in the Cook Mountains. Named by the VUWAE (1962-63). Prof. Charles C. Rich, geologist and deputy leader of the VUWAE, was affiliated with Bowling Green State University, Ohio.  Bowling Green Col 79°40′S 158°35′E. An ice-filled east–west col between Reeves Plateau and Bowling Green Plateau in the Cook Mountains. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in association with Bowling Green Plateau.  Gatson Ridge 79°43′S 158°51′E. A jagged ridge, 3 nautical miles (6 km) long with an elevation of 1158m. It runs east from the southern part of Bowling Green Plateau in the Brown Hills of the Cook Mountains. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names after Karl W. Gatson of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a topographic engineer on the joint 1975–76 USGS – British Antarctic Survey project to establish control points for Landsat mosaics of Palmer Land, and to establish geodetically tied independent survey nets in the Ellsworth Mountains and Antarctic Peninsula into a worldwide reference system using Doppler satellite control.  Wright Hill 79°42′S 158°46′E. A large flat-topped hill at the east side of Bowling Green Plateau in the Cook Mountains. Mapped by the Darwin Glacier Party of the CTAE (1956-58). Named after D. Wright, a member of the CTAE who accompanied Sir Edmund Hillary to the South Pole.  References Sources   == Further reading ==

Riseholme () is a fictional Elizabethan village in the Cotswolds in the "Lucia" novels of Edward Frederic Benson (1867–1940). It is thought to have been based on Broadway, Worcestershire.  Lucia and Riseholme Riseholme first appeared as the home of Emmeline Lucas ("Lucia") and her husband, Philip (a retired barrister whom she called "Peppino"), in Queen Lucia (1920). The Lucases had by then lived for ten years at The Hurst, in front of which was a Shakespearean garden. Lucia was "Queen" of Riseholme, the main figures in her circle being George ("Georgie" or "Georgino") Pillson and Daisy Quantock. Riseholme appeared also in Lucia in London (1927), in which Lucia launched herself on London society; Mapp and Lucia (1931), in which, following Peppino's death, both Lucia and Georgie (who entered into a companionable marriage in Lucia's Progress, 1935), took holiday lets in the Sussex town of Tilling (based on Rye) where, at the end of the summer of 1930, they decided to settle. At Tilling Lucia unveiled her celebrated dish, Lobster à la Riseholme.   Lucia and Georgie visited Riseholme again in Trouble for Lucia (1939) where they stayed at the home of the operatic prima donna Olga Bracely and Lucia called on Poppy, Duchess of Sheffield, at nearby Sheffield Castle (which Benson located at "Sheffield Bottom"—unconnected to the Yorkshire Sheffield). It was revealed in Mapp and Lucia that Lucia's great rival in Tilling, Elizabeth Mapp (Miss Mapp, 1922) had once visited Riseholme and stayed at the Ambermere Arms. She also hijacked Lucia's au reservoir (for au revoir) and presented it to Tilling society as her own.  Sources of Riseholme Cynthia and Tony Revell (1984) Mr Benson remembered in Rye, and the world of Tilling cited Sir Steven Runciman (1903–2000), a Cambridge historian who knew Benson well, and Benson's manservant Charlie Tomalin (d.1981) for the assertion that Riseholme was based on Broadway. Benson was known to have visited the American actress Mary Anderson (1859–1940), long resident in England, who lived in Broadway at Court Farm. The name was probably derived from the village of Riseholme, near Lincoln, of whose Church of England cathedral, Benson's father, Edward White Benson, was Chancellor before becoming Bishop of Truro in 1877. Benson used Riseborough as the name of a town similar to Rye in his novel Mrs Ames (1912).   == References ==

Leslie Hood (13 September 1876 – 23 September 1932) was an English rugby union player. He competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics and won silver as part of the Great Britain team in what was the first rugby union competition at an Olympic Games. He also competed in amateur catch-as-catch-can wrestling competitions and played ice hockey at Manchester. He was born in York, the third son of William Hood, a general practitioner in practice at Castlegate, York. Along with his three brothers, he was educated at St Peter's School, York. He was a good all-round sportsperson but not as academically gifted as his siblings. In 1896, he joined Hammersmith rugby union club as a wing three-quarter back, completing two seasons with the club, before joining Rosslyn Park rugby club. In 1899, he entered Eugen Sandow's bodybuilding competition at Crystal Palace Park and won a gold medal. In 1901, he won the twelfth amateur Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling championships in the 12 stone (76 kilograms) category. He retained a life-long interest in winter sports and mountaineering, and in 1911, he competed in the Bott handicap on the Cresta Run at St. Moritz, Engadine in Switzerland. Hood excelled at ice skating, and in the 1910s, he would compete in ice dance competitions with Ethel Muckelt. He was a founding player in the Manchester ice hockey team that was based at the Ice Palace ice rink in Derby Street, Cheetham. By 1927, he was a director of the Ice Palace and Taylor Brothers & Co., a steel manufacturing company with works at Trafford Park, Trafford, Manchester, and by 1928, he was vice president of the company. He had always maintained a good level of physical fitness, however, in late 1929, he was diagnosed with progressive muscular atrophy and died of pneumonia at a nursing home in Whalley Range, Manchester.  Early life and family background Hood was born on 13 September 1876 at York. He was the third son of William Hood and Frances "Fanny" Horner, née Lockwood. His father studied medicine at St Bartholomew's, London, and after he qualified, he was appointed surgeon to the Koninklijke West-Indische Maildienst (KWIM, the "Royal West India Mail Service"). In 1863, he began general practice in York and was medical officer to St Mary's Hospital, York. His mother was the only daughter of Joseph William Lockwood, a veterinary surgeon practising at 21 Castlegate, York, the same street where William lived and held his practice. They married on 1 March 1870 at Christ Church, Harrogate. Hood's eldest brother, Noel Lockwood, was a general practitioner with a practise in York, and until his retirement, honorary surgeon at York County Hospital. He had been on the medical staff of the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, and the Royal Brompton Hospital, Chelsea London. Hood was best man when Noel married Margery Josephine Williams on 28 June 1911 at St Stephen's, South Kensington. He had captained the Yorkshire field hockey team and played rugby for York. He died on 16 August 1948 at his home in Acomb, York. Hood's youngest brother, William Wells, was an engineer for North Eastern Railway. He served in the Yorkshire Imperial Yeomanry during the Second Boer War and was commissioned a sub‑lieutenant in the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) at the start of World War I. In 1916, he was awarded the Order of Saint Anna (third class) by Russia, and in 1918, he received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Hood's younger brother, Clifford, was educated at St Martin's school, Castlegate, before winning an open mathematical scholarship to Exeter School. Around 1897, Clifford went to the United States to work on a ranch, and 1901, emigrated to New Zealand with Hood's elder brother, Williford. The two brothers went on to run a farm in Whangara, before selling and moving to separate farms in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia. On 10 January 1912, Clifford married Mary Fraser, third daughter of Thomas Fraser, at Pouawa, Gisborne, New Zealand. Around 1920, the family moved back to Gisborne, to run a sheep farm owned by Mary. On 1 June 1924, Clifford killed himself due to concerns over the farm's financial position. Williford continued to farm at Pittsworth in Darling Downs, Queensland, and married Fannie Filmer Ware, the second daughter of Arthur Ware, on 4 June 1913 at St Paul's Church, Maryborough, Queensland. Williford died on 26 March 1957 in Queensland. Hood's elder sister, Amy Louise Bower, was born on 18 June 1872 at Castlegate. She was a medical doctor, and on 27 October 1898, she married a general practitioner, Alfred Waugh Metcalfe, at St Mary's, Castlegate. Alfred was medical officer for the dispensary in York and a member of the York Medical Society. She died on 12 January 1954 at Southmead Hospital after she fell and broke her thigh at the home of her daughter in Alveston, South Gloucestershire.  Education Hood was first educated at St Olave's preparatory school in Marygate, York, before going to St Peter's School, York, where his three brothers were educated. He was a good all-round sportsperson, and played cricket and rugby union at wing three-quarter back for the school. Outside of school, he would compete in one-mile novice bicycle races organised by the York Star Cycling Club at the York Cricket Club. Although not as academically gifted as his siblings, in December 1893, he passed the College of Preceptors examination at St Martin's school in the first division of third class. On 6 October 1894, he returned to St Peter's to play in an Old Boys rugby union match against a mixed school team. He scored a try and the Old Boys won by fourteen points to six. In December of the same year, he played in a rugby union match against the school's first team. His brother, Noel, captained the Old Boys, and Hood played at wing three-quarter back. At the time, Hood was playing for the York rugby union second team.  Sporting career Hood played his first senior rugby union game on 3 October 1896 for Hammersmith Rugby Union Club in the opening match of the season against Twickenham. The match was held at Twickenham and he played at wing three-quarter back. He scored two tries and Hammersmith won by six tries and four goals for thirty-eight points to nil. In the following year, Hammersmith strengthened their side and began training several weeks before their first match. He played in the opening match between Hammersmith and Saracens. The match was held on 2 October 1897 at Saracens' home ground in Park Road, Crouch End, North London, and he played at wing three‑quarter back for Hammersmith. Hammersmith won by one goal with Hood close to scoring a try. Hood played his final game for Hammersmith in the last match of the 1897–98 season against Streatham on 26 March 1898. The game was played in a blizzard that hindered skilled play, and subsequently, Hammersmith lost by a try and goal to nil. In the following season, he joined Rosslyn Park Rugby Football Club at wing three-quarter back. His first reported game was on 1 October 1898 against Lennox Football Club at the London Athletic Club ground in Stamford Bridge. He played for Rosslyn Park until his final game on 4 January 1902 against Old Merchant Taylors' FC at the Old Deer Park in Richmond. Old Merchant Taylors won by three tries and two goals to nil. In October 1900, Hood was selected to play for a British rugby union team in a match against France at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. This would be the first rugby union competition at an Olympic Games.: 161  The French were represented by the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques (USFSA Union of French Athletic Sports Societies),: 162  while the British team was coordinated by Claud Whittindale with the help of a friend in the French Rugby Union. Claud was the son of an auctioneer, and at the time of the competition, he played for Coventry Rugby Football Club. Claud Whittindale had been a member of the Stade Français rugby union team in Paris since 1898, before joining Aston Old Edwardians Rugby Club at Perry Barr, Birmingham, in 1900. His elder brother, Karl, also played for the club. Some English language sources report that their younger brother, Raymond, was selected to play at the Vélodrome de Vincennes (Vélodrome), Paris. However, it was Karl that was chosen to play at one of the four three-quarter back positions, along with Hood, Claud, and Herbert Nicol (another Aston Old Edwardian). The team was named Moseley Wanderers but had no connection with the Moseley Rugby Club in Birmingham, although some current players at the club had been selected to play in the match.  The team travelled overnight for the match at 3:00 pm on Sunday 28 October 1900, after at least five team members had played for their clubs that day. France scored six tries in the first half and two in the second with Joseph Wallis scoring Britain's only try. Henry Birtles, Britain's captain, converted the goal kick and scored a penalty.: 164  France won the game twenty-seven points to eight in front of a six thousand strong crowd at the Vélodrome.: 163–164  The French press reported that Britain seemed exhausted and lacked the ability to play safe but praised Herbert Loveitt for his composure and skill on the ball. France, although skilled in attack, often failed to defend. Giroux and Reichel were criticised for being clumsy, and Rischmann, for failing to pass the ball.  The rugby matches were organised as a round-robin tournament where France, Germany, and Great Britain would play each other in turn. However, the Great Britain versus Germany match did not go ahead as planned on 21 October 1900, as neither team was able to stay in Paris for the entire fifteen days of the competition.: 161  France had beaten Germany on 14 October 1900,: 162  and consequently, France was awarded gold, and Germany and Britain were credited with silver.: 164  In the Olympic regulations, it was stated that "in each match, the winning team will receive an art object; in addition, all players who took part in one of the matches will receive a souvenir." The British team returned home straight after the match, and it is not known if Hood, or any of the team members, received a medal or souvenir. By April 1899, Hood was living at 30 Guilford Street in Russell Square, and attending strength training courses at Eugen Sandow's Ebury Street school in Belgravia. On 29 November 1899, he entered Sandow's bodybuilding competition at Crystal Palace Park and won a gold medal in a field of eighty-two competitors from Middlesex. In January 1900, he was listed to appear as a competitor in the annual amateur Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling (Cumberland) championships at Earl's Court. However, he failed to appear, as did a number of other competitors that had been listed in the 10.5 stone (67 kilograms) catch-as-catch-can category. In the following year, he entered the twelfth amateur Cumberland championships in the 12 stone (76 kilograms) category. The championships were held on 7 February 1901 at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden. Described as a "powerfully-built exponent", Hood beat Joe Baddeley, of the Polytechnic Athletic Club, by two falls to one.  In 1903, Hood and his brothers, Noel and William, were elected to the membership of the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club. They retained a life-long interest in winter sports and mountaineering, and in August 1905, they climbed the majority of the mountains in the Bernese Alps, that included the Wetterhorn, Jungfrau, Eiger, and Finsteraarhorn. In 1906 and 1908 respectively, Noel and Hood were elected to the Alpine Club. On 15 February 1911, Hood competed in the Bott handicap on the Cresta Run at St. Moritz, Engadine, Switzerland. The race was named after Arden Bott, who, in 1902, had refined the skeleton toboggan that was used in subsequent competitions. The competition attracted fourteen starters and took place over three courses. Kempton Cannon won the competition, beating Hood by just 0.2 seconds. Hood excelled at ice skating, and while staying in Engadine, would compete in ice dance competitions. In February 1911, Hood and his dance partner, Dina Mancio, won an ice waltzing competition organised by the St. Moritz Skating Association at the Kulm Hotel in St. Moritz. They beat Ethel Muckelt and her dance partner, Henry Landau. Mancio was a famed ice dancer who had won the Italian national cup many times with her dance partner Gino Voli. Landau, a South African, was recruited at the beginning of World War I by the British secret service, now known as MI6, to be a spy handler in the Netherlands.: 130  In the 1910s, Hood would partner with Muckelt for ice dance competitions and other social occasions. Hood was a founding member of the Manchester ice hockey team that was based at the Ice Palace ice rink in Derby Street, Cheetham. Robert Noton Barclay, a former Lord Mayor of Manchester, was also an original member of the team. One of their first matches was against the Prince's club from Hammersmith, London. He showed excellent form but received a cut to his nose, and consequently, missed some of the game. Manchester lost by four goals to nil. He would later become a director of the Ice Palace.  Later life and death Hood had a number run-ins with the law, including a fine in 1904 for "indecent bathing" in the River Wey at Pyrford, Surrey, and 1926 and 1927, fines for dangerous driving. By 1927, he was a director of Taylor Brothers & Co., a steel manufacturing company with works at Trafford Park, Trafford, Manchester, and by 1928, he was vice president of the company. Later that year, Taylor Brothers was merged with the English Steel Corporation. In November 1931, he resigned from the board of Darlington Forge, a heavy engineering company located at Albert Hill, Darlington, after it had gone into liquidation in 1930. He was also a director of, amongst other companies, the Blake Boiler Wagon and Engineering Company, Dumplington Estates, Miners Silica Quarries, North Lonsdale Tar Macadam, and Roberts & Maginnis. Hood had always maintained a good level of physical fitness, however, in late 1929, he was diagnosed with progressive muscular atrophy (PMA).: 663  He died of hypostatic pneumonia on 23 September 1932 at Doriscourt Nursing Home, Upper Chorlton Road, Whalley Range, Manchester.: 663  The funeral service was held on 26 September 1932 at Manchester Crematorium and his ashes later scattered.: 656  Formerly of Moss House, Trafford Park, he left an estate of £9,680 18s 3d, with net personalty £9,507 (equivalent to £833,600 in 2023). He left Ethel Muckelt, his former ice dance partner, £208 per year (equivalent to £18,200 in 2023) for the remainder of her life.: 661  An obituary appeared in the December 1932 issue of The Peterite, the magazine of his former school, and stated that "Hood was a very fine athlete and gymnast ... other sports at which he excelled were wrestling and skating, at both of which he won many trophies."

Mary recommends that Jane participate in a Black Mass with Mary's sect, which she does despite several misgivings. Afterwards Jane begins to experience nightmares of a strange man and starts seeing him in her waking life, making her increasingly unable to distinguish the dream world from the real one. Despite the rituals becoming more bizarre and sexualized, Jane continues to attend the sect's rituals. When the latest ritual results in Mary's death, Jane flees in horror. The strange man appears in front of her and reveals that her mother was part of the sect and that she was murdered because she wanted to leave. He also tells her that Mary was killed for bringing in a novice. Despite these warnings Jane again tries to flee by hiding out in the countryside, only for this to end with several more deaths. Ultimately Richard, along with the police, are able to discover that Barbara is behind the Black Masses. Not only a member of the sect, Barbara wanted to take control of their mother's legacy. Fearing for Jane's wellbeing, Richard kills Barbara and Jane is taken to the hospital. At the hospital Jane has a nightmare that Richard is killed by the sect and that it is covered up by the police, as their head is a sect member. When they return home they are attacked twice by people related to the sect, the second of which is by the leader. Richard throws him off the roof, seemingly ending the nightmare forever.

The 2012–13 Football League Championship (known as the npower Championship for sponsorship reasons) was the ninth season of the league under its current title and twentieth season under its current league division format. The season began on 17 August 2012 with promotion candidates Cardiff City hosting newly promoted Huddersfield Town at Cardiff City Stadium and finished on 27 May 2013 with the play-off final. Of the 24 teams which participate, eighteen of these remain following the 2011–12 Football League Championship. They were joined by Charlton Athletic, Sheffield Wednesday and Huddersfield Town from 2011–12 Football League One, and Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers and Wolverhampton Wanderers from the 2011–12 Premier League. The final place was decided on 26 May 2012, as Huddersfield Town defeated Sheffield United 8–7 on penalties, in the 2012 Football League One play-off final. Cardiff City won the league in their first season since a controversial rebrand; they achieved promotion to the top flight for the first time since 1960 and became the second Welsh club to play in the Premier League. The second automatic promotion spot was won by Hull City with a 2–2 draw against Cardiff on the final day after a dramatic finale to the season. Watford, just two points behind, had to settle for a place in the playoffs, joining Brighton & Hove Albion, Crystal Palace, and Leicester City, who secured their place with a last-minute goal over rivals Nottingham Forest. In the playoffs, Watford defeated Leicester City 3–2, Crystal Palace defeated Brighton 2–0, and in the final Watford was upset by Crystal Palace to gain the promotion. Bristol City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Peterborough United were relegated. Peterborough gained 54 points, the highest ever for a relegated team in Championship history. Wolves' relegation was the first time a team had been relegated from the top tier to the third tier in consecutive seasons since Swindon Town in 1994 and 1995. They also became the first team to achieve this feat twice.  Changes from last season Team changes Rules changes On 25 April 2012, it was announced that financial fair play rules would be introduced for teams within The Championship. This means that clubs have agreed to new rules on sustainable financing which includes:  Acceptable losses of £4 million in the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, reducing to £2 million in 2015–16 season Acceptable amounts of shareholder investment of £8 million in the 2011–12 season, £6 million in the 2012–13 season, reducing to £3 million in 2015–16 season New rules on providing accounts New penalties for teams that fail to abide by the rules Also the 2011–12 season saw Football League clubs vote for five substitutes instead of seven. However, on 1 June 2012, Football League clubs re-voted with the outcome of seven substitutes instead of five, ahead of the 2012–13 Football League season.

Watford and Hull City were both fighting for 2nd place and automatic promotion to the 2013–14 Premier League. Crystal Palace, Leicester City, Bolton Wanderers and Nottingham Forest were all fighting for 5th and 6th place, and for a play-off spot. However, on the final day, it was mathematically possible for any 2 of 7 teams to get relegated alongside already relegated Bristol City. These teams were Wolverhampton Wanderers, Peterborough United, Huddersfield Town, Blackburn Rovers, Millwall, Barnsley and Sheffield Wednesday. Late drama occupied all three battles, with the headlines inevitably going to Hull, who won promotion to the Premier League after a 2–2 draw with newly crowned champions Cardiff City and Watford being beaten 2–1 by Leeds United. Hull were 2–1 up and in the 91st minute when they were awarded a penalty which could have sealed their 2nd place spot. Hull missed their penalty and in the 93rd minute, Cardiff were awarded a penalty, which was converted by Nicky Maynard, bringing the score to 2–2. After a serious injury delayed the match, the Watford game was fifteen minutes behind the other games, so with the score at 1–1, Watford knew that a win would secure their promotion to the Premier League. In the 89th minute Leeds scored to make it 2–1. The scores stayed that way and promotion for Hull was assured. In the play-off battle between Leicester City, Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest and Bolton, there was a late goal for Leicester (vs Nottingham Forest) that secured a 3–2 victory, meaning that the 2–2 draw between Bolton Wanderers and Blackpool left them in 6th place. As the other results turned out, Crystal Palace would have remained in 5th place with a loss, but also scored late on to beat Peterborough 3–2. This left Bolton in 7th place, missing out on play-offs via goal difference. The relegation battle ended in disappointment for Wolves and Peterborough. The late goal for Crystal Palace against Peterborough meant that a 1–1 draw was enough for Blackburn, a 2–0 win for Sheffield Wednesday over Middlesbrough was enough to secure their safety, a 1–0 defeat for Millwall against Derby County was enough for them and a 2–2 draw between Huddersfield and Barnsley was enough for both teams. Wolves lost 2–0 to Brighton, having started the day in the most difficult situation of the threatened teams.   == References ==

Lookin' Italian is a 1994 American crime film directed by Guy Magar and starring Jay Acovone and Matt LeBlanc.  Synopsis Vinny Pallazzo (Jay Acovone) is a retired gangster who has left the mafia after a disastrous incident. Now working as a clerk in a dusty bookshop of Los Angeles, he has to look after his young, reckless nephew Anthony (Matt LeBlanc), who lives fast, spending his time between seducing girls at the bookshop, dancing in nightclubs and playing poker games with friends. Vinny tries to do everything so that Anthony doesn't cross paths with mafia and gang wars, as he is afraid that his brash and hot-blooded nephew might end up like his father - dead. But that may be a lot more difficult than it sounds, especially after Anthony's girlfriend is brutally killed with another friend of his, by a gang. Anthony wants then to be avenged, especially after learning the truth about his father.  Cast Jay Acovone as Vinny Pallazzo Matt LeBlanc as Anthony Manetti Stephanie Richards as Danielle John La Motta as Don Dinardo Ralph Manza as Manza Lou Rawls as Willy Daniel O'Callaghan as Buster Réal Andrews as Riva Tommy Morgan Jr. (credited as Tommy Morgan) as Leon Nichole Carter as Dominique Argentina Brunetti plays a grandmother.  Denise Richards (credited as Denise Lee Richards) portrays Elizabeth.  Production A low-budget independent movie, Lookin' Italian is meant to be, in director  Guy Magar words, "an hommage to Scorsese and to Italian-American culture ... To me, the words "Lookin' Italian" mean "lookin' good". Magar also mentioned in his autobiography about the good friendship between Acovone and LeBlanc as the first took the latter under his wing and helped him with his acting.  Critical reception The critical response was mixed. Variety said:  Vet TV director Guy Magar takes an able cast through the paces of a story that feels stitched together from too many well-worn sources. The story of an ex-Mafioso who tries to start a new life, but finds it difficult to shake family allegiances and his violent past, Lookin' Italian fails to overcome the script's familiar turns and hoary cliches. Inconsistencies in tone, ranging from Revenge of the Nerds humor to bloody Tarantino-style mayhem and A Bronx Tale domestic melodrama, further distance pic from theatrical contention. The attractive leads and colorful supporting characters may help only enough for a video spot. ... With solid tech support, pic looks and sounds fine, but could use some judicious editing, especially in the draggy first act. An excess of repetitive dialogue could use pruning as well. On the other hand, other newspapers gave some good reviews, especially for a low-budget and low-promoted film. The Press Enterprise remarked, for example, that Lookin' Italian was "A powerful, smart and sassy independently-made film that comes together so well – blending comedy and drama, issues and entertainment – is a tribute to Guy Magar who made it for the low Hollywood cost of under $1-million!"

Algonquin Provincial Park is an Ontario provincial park located between Georgian Bay and the Ottawa River, mostly within the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District. Established in 1893, it is the oldest provincial park in Canada.  Additions since its creation have increased the park to its current size of about 7,653 km2 (2,955 sq mi). The park is contiguous with several smaller, administratively separate provincial parks that protect important rivers in the area, resulting in a larger total protected area. Its size, combined with its proximity to the major urban centres of Toronto and Ottawa, makes Algonquin one of the most popular provincial parks in the province and the country.  Highway 60 runs through the south end of the park, while the Trans-Canada Highway bypasses it to the north. Over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of streams and rivers are located within the park.  Some notable examples include Canoe Lake and the Petawawa, Nipissing, Amable du Fond, Madawaska, and Tim rivers. These were formed by the retreat of the glaciers during the last ice age. The park is considered part of the "border" between Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario.  The park is in an area of transition between northern coniferous forest and southern deciduous forest.  This unique mixture of forest types, and the wide variety of environments in the park, allows the park to support an uncommon diversity of plant and animal species.  It is also an important site for wildlife research. Algonquin Park was named a National Historic Site in 1992 in recognition of several heritage values including: its role in the development of park management; pioneering visitor interpretation programs later adopted by national and provincial parks across the country; its role in inspiring artists, which in turn gave Canadians a greater sense of their country; and historic structures such as lodges, hotels, cottages, camps, entrance gates (the West Gate was designed by George H. Williams, Chief Architect and Deputy Minister of Public Works for the Province of Ontario), a railway station, and administration and museum buildings. Algonquin Park is the only designated park within the province of Ontario to allow industrial logging to take place within its borders.  History Early logging In the 19th century, the logging industry cut the large white pine and red pine trees to produce lumber for domestic and American markets, as well as square timber for export to Great Britain.  The loggers were followed by small numbers of homesteaders and farmers.  Even at that time, however, the area's beauty was recognized by nature preservationists. To manage these conflicting interests, the Ontario Government appointed a commission to inquire into and report on the matter.  The act to establish Algonquin Park was drawn up in 1892 by this five member Royal Commission, made up of Alexander Kirkwood (the chairman and Commissioner of Crown Lands), James Dickson (Ontario Land Surveyor), Archibald Blue (director of mines), Robert Phipps (head of the Forestry Branch), and Aubrey White (Assistant Commissioner of Crown Lands).  Their report recommended the establishment of a park in the territory lying near and enclosing the headwaters of five major rivers, those being: the Muskoka, Little Madawaska River (including Opeongo), Amable du Fond River, Petawawa River, and South rivers. The commissioners remarked in their report: "the experience of older countries had everywhere shown that the wholesale and indiscriminate slaughter of forests brings a host of evils in its train.  Wide tracts are converted from fertile plains into arid desert, springs and streams are dried up, and the rainfall, instead of percolating gently through the forest floor and finding its way by easy stages by brook and river to the lower levels, now descends the valley in hurrying torrents, carrying before it tempestuous floods."  Report of the (Ontario) Royal Commission on Forest Conservation and National Park, Mar. 8, 1893 Although much of the area within Algonquin had been under license for some time, it was intended to make the park an example of good forestry practices.  Only licenses to cut pine would be issued.  The commissioners had recommended that when the hardwood was mature, it too should be cut.  Dark Day fire Researchers believe that smoke from a forest fire in Algonquin Park was responsible for New England's Dark Day of May 19, 1780.  This is based on investigations into scar marks which are left in the growth rings of trees that survive forest fires.  Data obtained from such scar marks make it possible to approximate the date of a past fire.  Current logging Industrial logging continues in significant portions of the park's interior.  After 2013 amendments to the park management plan, 65.3% of the park (498,785 hectares) remains in the recreation/utilization zone where logging is permitted. Numerous methods of logging take place throughout the park including clear cutting, selection cutting and shelterwood cutting. As of 2009, the Algonquin Forestry Authority is currently reviewing an application that would allow for expansion of current logging roads and the addition of new ones. Forestry activities in Algonquin, including logging are carried out in accordance with a Forest Management Plan prepared according to Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry requirements. The planning process includes public consultation opportunities at several stages of preparation.  The 2010–2020 approved Forest Management Plan for the Algonquin Park Forest, the 2015–2020 Phase 2 Plan, and the associated Annual Work Schedules and Reports are available on the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's website.  Park formation An Act to establish "Algonquin National Park of Ontario" was passed by the Liberal government of Oliver Mowat in the Ontario Legislature, May 23, 1893 (56 Vic., c.8). The name "Algonquin" refers to the Algonquin people, indigenous inhabitants of the area. Although called a "national park", Algonquin has always been under the jurisdiction of the provincial government.  No provincial parks existed until Algonquin, but there was a new movement to create national parks since Banff's establishment in 1885.  The name was changed to Algonquin Provincial Park in 1913.  Notice regarding establishment of 'The Algonquin National Park of Ontario', Sept. 27, 1893, transcribed on Death On a Painted Lake: The Death of Tom Thomson Archibald M. Campbell, "The Algonquin National Park of Ontario-Its Resources and Advantages", The Ottawa Naturalist XV (June, 1901): 80-89, transcribed on Death On a Painted Lake: The Death of Tom Thomson  The boundaries of the park included 18 townships within the District of Nipissing, covering an area of 3,797 km2 (1,466 sq mi) of which 10% was under water.  The tract of land was to be set apart, as a public park, health resort and pleasure ground for the benefit, advantage and enjoyment of all the people of the province.  The year following the park's creation saw portions of six new townships added to the existing park's boundaries (Paxton, McCraney, Finlayson, Butt, Ballantyne, and Boyd).  The first four were  put up for auction that same year.  The production of the lumber companies operating in the park at the time increased from 680,000 m3 (288 million board feet) in 1886 to 809,000 m3 (343 million board feet) in 1896. Peter Thomson, the first chief ranger of Algonquin Park, was responsible for establishing park boundaries, constructing buildings, and posting notices to warn hunters and trappers against trespassing. He liaised with timber operators, oversaw the removal of settlers and their homes, and notified local Algonquin natives that they could no longer hunt, trap or live in the area.  Park rangers began patrolling the park, the game protected, and forest fires were suppressed.  By 1910 wildlife numbers were increasing.  Thousands of people had visited the great pleasure resort and it was said to be undeniably one of the most beautiful natural parks in the Dominion, if not on this continent. All this had entailed a large expenditure by the government, which was recovered chiefly through the maintenance of timber licenses.  There was no fee for camping permits, though a nominal charge was introduced for fishing and guides' licenses when "an Act to establish the Algonquin National Park of Ontario" was again passed by the legislature, March 19, 1910.  This new legislation included the original area as well as portions of ten townships annexed into the park since 1893, and allowed for further expansion by the addition of adjacent townships, should it become necessary. Another notable figure in park management was Frank MacDougall, the park's chief ranger from 1931 to 1941.  He was the first ranger to supervise the park by airplane, flying a Fairchild KR-34.  He eventually became deputy minister for the provincial Ministry of Lands and Forests, and the portion of Highway 60 which passes through Algonquin Park has been named the Frank A. MacDougall Parkway in his honour.  Railway, settlement, and the beginning of tourism Construction of the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway (O. A. & P. S.) through the park in 1896 provided the first easy access to the area.  While the park's purpose was to control settlement within its boundaries, the families of railway workers as well as those of the lumbermen took up residence in the park.  The village of Mowat on the west side of Canoe Lake was first established in 1893 as a logging camp for the Gilmour Lumber Company.  From there, logs were driven down the Oxtongue River towards Lake of Bays and eventually on to Trenton.  In the same year the park headquarters was established near the logging camp.  The arrival of the railway had provided easy access for the lumbermen as well.  The Gilmour firm decided to put up a sawmill closer to their source of timber.  By 1897 the village of Mowat had grown to 500 residents and there were 18 km (11 mi) of railway siding. The same year saw the official opening of the railway between Ottawa and Depot Harbour.  Park headquarters were also relocated in 1897 from Mowat to a point of land on the north shore of Cache Lake, adjacent to the railway.  The O. A. & P. S. put up a station there it named Algonquin Park.  The railway, taken over by the Canada Atlantic Railway in 1899, was in turn sold to the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) in 1905. In 1898 George W. Bartlett was appointed as the second superintendent of Algonquin Park, replacing the late Peter Thompson.  Placed under the direction of the Premier of Ontario to make the park self-sufficient, Bartlett worked to make the park more attractive to tourists by encouraging short-term leases for cottages, lodges, and camps.  Changes came about in 1908, when Hotel Algonquin was opened at Joe Lake.  The Grand Trunk Railway opened its first hotel, the Highland Inn, near Park Headquarters.  Built on a hill behind Algonquin Park station, the two-storey year-round resort was an immediate success.  Soon other guest lodges were established in the park.  To the west side of Highland Inn, land was cleared and raised wooden platforms erected, on which tents (supplied by the hotel), were put up to meet the requirements of the rapidly growing tourist trade. At the village of Mowat, abandoned by Gilmour Lumber Co. in 1900, the mill's former boarding house became Mowat Lodge in 1913.  The Highland Inn was enlarged, and new camps were built.  Nominigan Camp, consisting of a main lodge with six cabins of log construction, was established on Smoke Lake.  Camp Minnesing on Burnt Island Lake was created as a wilderness lodge.  Both, open only in July and August, were built by the GTR as affiliates of the Highland Inn. A second railway, the Canadian Northern (CNoR), was built across the northern portion of the park, opening in 1915. Both lines later became part of Canadian National Railway.  The beginning of the end of rail service in the park happened in 1933 when a flood damaged an old Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway trestle on Cache Lake.  The trestle was deemed too dangerous to use and too expensive to fix, ending through service on the southern line (old O.A. & P.S.).  Service from the west ended in 1952, and from the east in 1959.  Service on the old CNoR line through the north end of the park ended in 1995.  Many of the trails in the park still make use of portions of the old railway rights-of-way.  Administration and management As recreational use of the park increased during the 1950s and 1960s, it became clear that a long-term plan to manage the park was required.  Six years of consultation with park users resulted in the 1974 publication of the Algonquin Master Plan, a management plan that sought to ensure that the park could continue indefinitely to serve all of the competing park interests.  Three major changes came about as a result of the plan.  One, the park was divided into zones with different specified purposes and uses: Nature Reserve and Historic (5.7% of land area), Wilderness (12%), Development (4.3%) and Recreation-Utilization (78%) zones.  Logging in the park was limited to the Recreation-Utilization zones, but was separated as much as possible from users of the park interior in order to maintain the park's natural environment.  Each year only a small percentage of the park is being actively logged.  Two, all existing timber licenses were cancelled, and all logging in the park is now done by the Algonquin Forestry Authority, which supplies timber to 10 private mills outside the park.  Three, rules were put in place to limit the impact of recreational use of the park.  Almost all cans and bottles are banned in the interior, and limits are placed on the number of people per campsite, and the number of people who can enter the park interior per day at each access point.  Also, the use of boat motors is limited, both in power and to a few of the larger and more accessible lakes.  The master plan has been reviewed and updated four times since 1974, with the latest version being published in 1999.  Climate The park has a humid continental climate (Köppen Climate Classification Dfb) with long, cold, snowy winters and warm summers.  In winter, temperatures frequently drop below −20 °C (−4.0 °F) while in summer, temperatures can exceed 30 °C (86.0 °F) 9 days per year.  Precipitation averages 810 mm (32 in) per year, which is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with late summer/early fall being the wettest months and the winter months being the driest.  Legacy of landscapes As a result of its beauty, Algonquin Park became recognized by nature preservationists.  It quickly became popular with anglers, though hunting was prohibited. The landscapes of Algonquin Park attracted artists such as Tom Thomson along with members of the Group of Seven.  Thomson served as a guide in the park, often working from Mowat Lodge.  He did much of his painting at Canoe Lake, and a favourite campsite of his was behind Hayhurst Point, a peninsula overlooking the central portion of the lake.  Many of Thomson's most significant paintings are of Algonquin Park, including The Jack Pine and The West Wind.  He died under mysterious circumstances at Canoe Lake in 1917.  A plaque recognizing his national historic significance stands at the Visitor Centre dock on Canoe Lake, erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.  Friends of the painter erected a cairn and totem pole memorial on Hayhurst Point, near the north end of the lake.  Visitor activities Algonquin is popular for year-round outdoor activities.  There are over 1,200 campsites in eight designated campgrounds along Highway 60 in the south end of the park, with almost 100 others in three other campgrounds across the northern and eastern edges.  There is also the Whitefish Lake group campground with 18 sites of various sizes to accommodate groups of 20, 30, or 40 people.  Interior Camping is possible further inside the park at sites accessible only by canoe or on foot.  The Algonquin Visitor Centre features exhibits about the natural and cultural history of the park. A large and detailed relief map of southern Ontario is displayed to enable a visitor to be oriented to the size and geography of the park.  In a flow-through style, exhibits continue with many taxidermied species set in their native surroundings, then progresses, in a chronological manner, through an extensive collection of artifacts relating to human intervention in the park.  The centre also includes a video theatre, a gift shop, a panoramic outdoor viewing deck, and an art gallery—"The Algonquin Room"—with changing exhibits of art related to the park.  Other activities include fishing, mountain biking, horseback riding, cross country skiing, and day hiking.  The park has 19 interpretive trails, ranging in length from 1 to 11.7 kilometres (0.62 to 7.27 mi).  Each trail comes with a trail guide and is meant to introduce visitors to a different aspect of the park's ecology or history. Algonquin is home to a Natural Heritage Education program.  The most popular aspect of the program are the weekly wolf howls. These are held (weather and wolves permitting) on Thursdays in the month of August, and sometimes in the first week of September if there is a Thursday before Labour Day.  Park staff attempt to locate a wolf pack on Wednesday evening and, if successful, they announce a public wolf howl the next day. The park also publishes a visitor's newsletter, The Raven, six times a year – two issues in spring, two in summer, one in the fall, and one in the winter.  Algonquin Logging Museum Opened in 1992, the Algonquin Logging Museum is located by the park's east gate. A 1.3 kilometres (0.81 mi) trail features a recreated logging camp, a steam-powered amphibious tug called an "alligator", logging equipment and interpretive panels about logging industry activities in the park. Exhibits include a video presentation. The museum is open seasonally. One annual feature worthy of note at the museum is "Logger's Day", typically held in late July or early August each year. This festivity includes musicians, a logger's old style lunch, activities for children, interpretive actors, and forest industry representatives.  Canoe routes Canoe camping is one of the most popular activities. This wilderness experience, essentially, a pristine wilderness canoe journey through vastness of the park, allows the tourist to enjoy the interior of Algonquin Park in ways inaccessible by any other means. The "Friends of Algonquin Park" organization publishes an authoritative map and guide called Canoe Routes of Algonquin Park.  Aspects of interior camping Although there are numerous drive-in campgrounds in Algonquin, the park is better known for its interior camping; that is, campsites which are only accessible by canoe or hiking in the summer, or ski or snowshoe in the winter.  Algonquin Park provides some of Canada's best canoeing, with hundreds of navigable lakes and rivers forming a 2,000-kilometre-long (1,200 mi) interconnected system of canoe routes. The two main access points to start a trip are located on Canoe Lake and Lake Opeongo.  The further a camper proceeds from these access points, the more wild the park becomes, and it is possible to spend several days in the interior with few or no sightings of other campers.  Park staff maintain portages between all major and even smaller lakes, and interior campsite reservations can be made through the main Ontario Parks reservation system. There are also three areas of back-country hiking trails, with sub-loops ranging from 6 to 88 kilometres (3.7 to 54.7 mi) long.  These hiking trails have their own dedicated campsites, typically located on the shores of small lakes.  Although some lakes have sites for both canoe and hiking access, the sites are designated by type of use. Interior camping can provide excellent wildlife viewing opportunities. The eerie call of the common loon can be heard from every campground and loons can be seen on almost every lake.  Moose, deer and beaver can often be seen, especially along waterways, given sufficiently quiet campers.  Otters are also present, but less frequently seen.  Black bears, although present in the park, are seldom seen, especially if appropriate precautions to avoid attracting them are taken.  Wolves may be heard, but will likely remain distant from campers.  Fishing Fishing is allowed in the park for holders of valid Ontario fishing licences, with the purchase of a daily or seasonal vehicle permit as well available through the Ministry of Natural Resources.  Fish such as bass, yellow perch, trout and pike can be found in the waterways of the park.  The further an angler is willing to travel from an access point, the better the fishing.  The backcountry lakes do not receive heavy fishing pressure.  Services The non-profit Friends of Algonquin Park operate a tourist information station, CFOA-FM.  A direct bus shuttle from Toronto is being run by Parkbus, a non-profit initiative, which is supported by the park.  Research Algonquin Park has been an important arena for research since the 1930s.  Four research facilities exist: Harkness Laboratory of Fisheries Research, Wildlife Research Station, Timber Research Station, and the visitor centre.  Over 1800 scientific papers have been published on research done in the park, covering almost every aspect of the park: wildlife, geology, forestry, history, human impacts, etc. In addition, the Park forms a radio quiet zone for the Algonquin Radio Observatory (ARO).  Summer camps Algonquin Park has been home to many historic summer camps including:  Algonquin Experience Camp, a now-defunct YMCA camp that was on the north shore of Whitefish Lake; Camp Ahmek (boys) and Camp Wapomeo (girls) (The Taylor Statten Camps), on Canoe Lake Camp Arowhon (boys and girls) on Teepee Lake;  Camp Pathfinder (boys) on Source Lake; Northway Lodge (girls) and its affiliate Camp Wendigo, a tripping outpost for boys, on Cache Lake; Camp Tamakwa (boys and girls), on South Tea Lake; Camp Tanamakoon (girls) on Tanamakoon Lake (linked to Cache Lake); Camps are members of the Ontario Camping Association.  Geology and soils Algonquin is almost entirely underlain by the Precambrian-era metamorphic and igneous rock of the Canadian Shield.  Quartz-feldspar gneiss and granite are among the most common types.  More mafic rock such as hornblende-biotite gneiss and gabbro are occasionally found. The Brent Crater has Ordovician period sedimentary rock, chiefly limestone and sandstone.  Glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch left a mantle of glacial till plus sandy and gravelly outwash deposits. Soils in the park are mostly coarse-textured and of poor quality, typical of the Canadian Shield.  The hilly western side (which includes all of the Highway 60 Corridor) has a stony fine sandy loam glacial till which holds water better than the very coarse outwash soils which dominate the eastern side.  The dominant soil classification on well drained forest soils is Orthic Humo-Ferric Podzol.  The most common soil series on till upland is Monteagle, while Wendigo dominates the outwash area.  Classic podzol profile development with a well-defined eluvial (Ae) horizon is the rule; however, in some areas this horizon has been obliterated by disturbance such as earthworm activity.  Concerns about effects of non-native earthworms on park soil ecosystems have not led to the banning of worm bait, but anglers are urged to dispose of unused worms in garbage containers. Gleysolic and organic soils are common where drainage is poor.  Rivers The park contains and protects the headwaters of these rivers:  Amable du Fond River Barron River Bonnechere River Gull River Madawaska River Magnetawan River Muskoka River Petawawa River York River  Flora and fauna Within the boundaries of the park, the following number of species are known to live: 53 species of mammals, 272 species of birds, 31 species of reptiles and amphibians, 54 species of fish, about 7000 species of insects, over 1000 species of plants, and over 1000 species of fungi. Animals that inhabit Algonquin include moose, black bears, white-tailed deer, Canada jays, beavers, red foxes, great grey owls, and Eastern wolf. Old growth sugar maple, hemlock and yellow birch forests are common in Algonquin Park. Researchers have aged trees in Algonquin's old-growth forests at up to 430 years old using ring counts, and up to 610 years old using estimation techniques. Some of Algonquin Park's old-growth forest occurs in the recreation-utilization zone and is available for logging.

"Edge of the Ocean" is a song by the American band Ivy for their third studio album, Long Distance (2000). Lead singer Dominique Durand wrote the song with band members Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase, who both produced it. It was released as the album's lead single in the United States in June 2001, through Nettwerk. Various physical singles were distributed throughout the following year, in addition to an adult alternative airplay release in the US. The song is an electronic-inspired trip hop pop ballad with minimal and simplistic lyrics. Durand's vocals were described as childlike and compared to those of Karen Carpenter. American musician Michael Hampton, a member of Durand and Chase's other band Paco, contributes to the track's instrumentation. "Edge of the Ocean" has received generally positive reviews from music critics, who called it a highlight from Long Distance. Following Schlesinger's death in 2020, the song was revisited by critics and frequently labeled as one of his finest works. It became Ivy's only single to chart, reaching number 160 on the UK Singles Chart and number 86 in Scotland. An accompanying music video for "Edge of the Ocean" was released in 2001 and directed by Schlesinger. It features Ivy relaxing at the beach and singing along to the song. "Edge of the Ocean" was featured in various television advertising campaigns, including for Holland America in 2002 and American Airlines in 2011, and has since been referred to as Ivy's signature song.  Background and release Following the release of their second studio album, Apartment Life, in 1997, Ivy was dropped from their record label Atlantic, and signed to 550 Music. Around the same time, the band's New York City recording studio burned down and was replaced with a new one, founded by Schlesinger and other member Andy Chase. After reissuing Apartment Life, member Adam Schlesinger released his second studio album with American band Fountains of Wayne, Utopia Parkway (1999). The album commercially underperformed, resulting in a second release from Atlantic and Schlesinger resuming work with Ivy. "Edge of the Ocean" first appeared on Long Distance, as the album's third track, which was initially released in Japan on November 8, 2000. It also appears on a Nettwerk-sponsored sampler album that was handed out during Coldplay's Parachutes Tour concert series in 2001. The song was written by Schlesinger, Chase, and Durand, while the production was handled by the latter two artists. Ivy recorded the song at Stratosphere Sound in New York City while mastering occurred at nearby Sony Music Studios and was handled by Vlado Meller. Schlesinger and Chase both are credited as mixers on the song and, additionally, Chase engineered the track with assistance from Geoff Sanoff. Chosen as the album's lead single in the United States, "Edge of the Ocean" was released in various formats as a single. In June 2001, when Ivy's cover of the Blow Monkeys' "Digging Your Scene" was sent to US modern rock radio stations as a single, "Edge of the Ocean" and Long Distance track "Disappointed" were distributed to adult alternative radio stations in the US for airplay. The US then received a limited edition, individually numbered 10" vinyl release, which occurred on July 10, 2001. It features an alternate version of "Hideaway" as the B-side and their previously unreleased cover of Steely Dan's "Only a Fool Would Say That" (1972). An extended play for "Edge of the Ocean" was distributed in the United Kingdom and released by Nettwerk. The promotional version was released in 2001, while the commercial versions were released on May 27, 2002 on 12" vinyl and compact discs; it features the Alpha's 'On the Beach' Mix, DuoTone Mix, Analog Bronca Mix, and album versions of "Edge of the Ocean" in two different orders, depending on the release. Also in 2002, the Filterheadz Dub Mix of the song was released as a 12" promotional single in the UK. Nettwerk digitally released the EP and Filterheadz Dub Mix to music retailers on July 19, 2011.  Composition and lyrics Musically, "Edge of the Ocean" is a "shimmering [and] contemporary" electronic-inspired trip hop pop ballad. In a 2011 interview with Magnet, Chase explained that the song balances "between the uplifting music and the bittersweet lyric," which he stated was also his preferred musical style. He continued,  saying that while writing the song, they tried "to go 100 percent" with creating a lyrical balance that "[came] from a specific place and yet remain[ed] general, even vague, enough that they can apply to anyone". In his weekly musical column, Bradford Brady from Star-News called Durand's vocals "haunting" and compared them to American singer Karen Carpenter. Chuck Campbell, writing for the same publication, called the chorus shimmering and described Durand's vocals as childlike. Tom Topkoff from Hybrid magazine referred to "Edge of the Ocean" as a "captivating and escapist tune" that sets the album's tone. According to its sheet music, "Edge of the Ocean" is set in the time signature of common time, and has a moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of D-flat major and it follows the setup of an instrumental intro, followed by two verses, each succeeded by a chorus and another intro. The first verse begins using the chord progressions of G♭–E♭m–D♭–G♭, which are replicated during the other verses and choruses; during the pre-chorus and bridge, the progressions transition to a E♭m–D♭–G♭–G♭ structure. American musicians Jeremy Freeman and fellow Paco member Michael Hampton are credited with providing additional loops and sounds to the song. The lyrics to "Edge of the Ocean" are rather simple, and were described as romantic. Durand opens the song explaining: "There's a place I dream about / Where the sun never goes out"; the chorus contains more minimalistic lyrics, with Durand harmonizing to "sha la la la la la la" repeatedly.  Reception and promotion "Edge of the Ocean" has received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Noel Dix from Exclaim liked it and album tracks "Worry About You" and "While We're in Love" for "com[ing] across as genuine rather than a pop band trying to cross over to the electronic scene". A reviewer from Resonance magazine provided a positive review of the song, calling it "a cool summer song", while a critic from The Boston Globe labeled it as a gem on Long Distance. In 2014, Mashable featured "Edge of the Ocean" on a list of "21 Songs to Help You Keep Calm". An AllMusic critic awarded the song 2.5 out of 5 stars in 2001. In a negative review, a critic from Alternative Press grouped "Edge of the Ocean" with the tracks that are "improbably edgeless, all love-me-do/love-me-don't plaints that evaporate on impact" on Long Distance. Following Schlesinger's death in 2020, several critics re-analyzed his discography retrospectively. Rob Tannenbaum from The New York Times compiled a list of his 30 most essential songs; "Edge of the Ocean" was Schlesinger's only Ivy song to appear on the list, and Tannenbaum described it as a highlight on Long Distance. Following the song's release in the United Kingdom in 2002, "Edge of the Ocean" became the group's first and only single to reach the Official Charts Company's UK Singles Chart. For the issue dated June 15, 2002, the song entered the chart at number 160 and fell off the following week. It also charted in Scotland in August 2008, debuting at number 86. According to Nettwerk, the song is Ivy's most commercially successful single, and they consider it to be their signature song. Variety's Charlie Amter noted that it was the group's most streamed song on Spotify and had been prominently used in several film and television appearances. According to John C. Hughes from Pop Dose claimed that because of how many media appearances the song had made, "chances are [most have] heard it and didn’t even know it". Ivy appeared as themselves on the American scripted television series Roswell to perform the Duotone Mix of "Edge of the Ocean" on the season 3 episode "To Have and to Hold" (2001). It later appeared on the series' official soundtrack, which was announced on December 13, 2001, and released on February 26, 2002. Additionally, "Edge of the Ocean" has been notably featured on Grey's Anatomy, and in 2011 it was used in American Airlines' television advertisement campaign. Ivy also lent the song to Holland America in 2002 for their then-upcoming ad campaign, in a move that Chase thought would be beneficial to the band. He explained: "At our level, this commercial can mean the difference between making our next album or not. Now, maybe there's people who look at us and that as a sellout. But I pose the question, would you rather hear another Ivy record or never hear another record again but we won't do any commercials?" An accompanying music video for "Edge of the Ocean" was filmed and directed by Schlesinger. It was released in 2001 and was the second video developed for Long Distance, after the release of "Lucy Doesn't Love You" in 2000. The "Edge of the Ocean" clip features the usage of the shorter Duotone Mix, as opposed to the album version. The video begins with Durand casually walking around a sandy beach and occasionally lip syncing to the song. Location shots of nearby boats, cliffs and landscape are interwoven with scenes of Durand, Schlesinger, and Chase adventuring oceanside.

William Goodridge Roberts  (1904–1974) was a Canadian painter known for his landscape paintings, still lifes, figure paintings and interiors. He was also a teacher.  Career Goodridge Roberts was the son of poet and novelist George Edward Theodore Goodridge Roberts and Frances Seymour Allen. Roberts was born in Bridgetown, Barbados, in 1904 while his parents were on holiday from their New Brunswick home. Roberts studied at the École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal and at the Art Students League of New York with John Sloan, Boardman Robinson and Max Weber (1926–1928). He moved to Ottawa in 1930, where he exhibited his work, and opened a summer school for painting in nearby Wakefield, in the Gatineau Valley. In 1932, Roberts held his first solo exhibition at Montreal's Arts Club, where he came to the attention of John Lyman. From 1933 to 1936 he was the resident artist at Queen's University, afterwards moving to Montreal. In 1938, Roberts, joined the Eastern Group of Painters as a charter member, and in 1939, again as a charter member, joined the Contemporary Arts Society, as well as exhibiting at the New York World's Fair. He taught at the Art Association of Montreal from 1940 to 1952. During the period from 1943 to 1945 he was an Official Second World War artist for the Royal Canadian Air Force, stationed in England. In 1952, works by Roberts along with those of Emily Carr, David Milne and Alfred Pellan represented Canada at the Venice Biennale. A scholarship was awarded (in 1953) by the Canadian government to allow Roberts to study painting in France. Then in 1959 he won the Glaxebrook award at the National Gallery of Canada for a landscape painting. This year (1959) until 1960 Roberts was the first resident artist at the University of New Brunswick. In 1964, he won the A. J. Casson Award, the annual "Open Water" competition organized by the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour (CSPWC). In 1969, he was a recipient of the Order of Canada and was given a traveling retrospective exhibition by the National Gallery of Canada, an unusual honour for a living artist at the time. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts (1956). He was also a member of the Canadian Group of Painters. Among the people who praised Roberts` work was the well-known American art critic, Clement Greenberg, who, in 1963, said that his work had been the portal through which he became interested in Canadian art. Following his death after a lengthy illness, his work was the subject of several museum solo exhibitions with publications, including a touring retrospective in 1998 titled Goodridge Roberts Revealed, curated by Sandra Paikowski.

In the Kingdom of Kandy in Sri Lanka, the Kings maintained a harem that consisted of a chief queen and one or two secondary queens. In addition to the queens, the harem also included concubines, who were divided into three categories based on their rank. The highest-ranking category was Randoli, which consisted of consorts of royal blood who held the position of chief queen. The second category, Rididoli, consisted of consorts from either noble families of royal lineage or sisters of Randoli. The lowest ranking category was Yakadadoli, who were from the Radala (Elite) castes. The names Randoli, Rididoli, and Yakadadoli are believed to have originated from the palanquins used by the different ranks of consorts of the Kings of the Kingdom of Kandy in Sri Lanka. The Randoli consorts used a palanquin made from gold, which is reflected in their name. The Rididoli consorts used a palanquin made from silver, and the Yakadadoli consorts used a palanquin made from iron. This naming convention was likely used to differentiate the different ranks and levels of status among the royal consorts.  Rank I - Randoli (Sinhala: රන් දෝලිය) Rank II - Rididoli (Sinhala: රිදී දෝලිය) Rank III - Yakadadoli (Sinhala: යකඩ දෝලිය)  Queen Consort Queen Consort (Sinhala: අග බිසව) was the highest-ranked position in the Randoli category, and her biological or adoptive children were the only ones qualified to succeed to the throne. Children of both Rididoli and Yakadadoli were disqualified from kingship. In the Kandyan Kingdom, the position of Queen Consort did not hold political power but enjoyed equal status as the king. In the first dynasty to rule the Kingdom of Kandy, the House of Siri Sanghabo, the kings married Sinhalese royal blood lineage (Gampola, Keerawalle) as the Queen Consort. However, in the second dynasty, House of Dinaraja, the kings married South Indian princesses of the Madurai royal family, except for the first and the second king, who married the only successor of the previous dynasty, Siri Sanghabo. In the last and the third dynasty, Nayakkar, the kings married South Indian princesses of Madurai. In this dynasty, the position of Queen Consort was more significant. They did not have any direct political powers, but they had the right to appoint the next successor to the throne, and their families had influence in the court of the Kandy.  Pramila Devi One of the most famous queen consorts in the history of the Kandy Kingdom was Pramila Devi, who hailed from the Nayakkar Dynasty of Madurai. However, her association with the second adigar of the court, Daskon, who was of Portuguese and French descent and a close friend of the king, was frowned upon as a forbidden affair. Despite being a consort, Pramila Devi was childless and refused to adopt the king's only son from a Yakadadoli (royal concubine), leaving the question of succession to the throne in doubt. In the end, she appointed her brother as the Apa (ඈපා, Great Duke), a powerful position, to be the next king of the kingdom, thereby establishing a new dynasty.  Kusumasana Devi Kusumāsana Devi, also known as Don Catherine of Kandy, was a significant figure in the history of the Kingdom of Kandy. As the only heir to the throne of Kandy from her father's lineage, she briefly ruled the kingdom as queen regnant backed by the Portuguese army in 1581. However, she was deposed by Vimaladharmasuriya I of Kandy due to political reasons. Kusumāsana Devi eventually married Vimaladharmasuriya I, becoming a queen consort. Due to her unique position as the heir to the throne, she enjoyed more significant political powers than any other queen consort in the history of the kingdom. However, after Vimaladharmasuriya I's sudden death, she decided to become the regent of the kingdom to pass the throne to her son, Mahastane Adahasin. Unfortunately, her plans were disrupted when Senarath of Kandy forcefully married her to establish himself as the king of Kandy. Despite being a queen consort, she was relatively inactive in politics during the reign of Senarath due to her physical and mental illness, which was most likely caused by forced marriage. Kusumāsana Devi fell ill after her son Mahastane Adahasin died in 1612, and she passed away on 10 July 1613 at the age of 35.  Venkata Rangammal Devi Venkata Rangammal was the mysterious queen consort who held the title in the final years of the Kingdom of Kandy. Not much is known about her life, but it is said that she lived a secluded life in the queen's quarters (Meda Wasala). Only her closest servants were able to catch a glimpse of her. After she was deposed from her position, she did not live much longer and passed away childless in the Vellore fort. Her life remains shrouded in mystery, leaving historians and curious minds to wonder about her story.  Queens' Chambers The Queens' Chambers, also known as the Meda Wasala (Sinhala: මැද වාසල), is located to the north of the Palle Vahale, which was used as quarters for the royal concubines and is similar in architectural design. It consists of a small open courtyard with verandahs and a single bedroom, constructed of valuable timber with a bed placed on four stone understructures. The entrance to the middle hall is made of large logs, and the door lid is small, attached to the tile with wooden hinges. The building is designed to be locked only from the inside, and the corridor near the courtyard carries frescoes, a unique feature for a residence. Many features of Kandy era architecture can be seen in the Meda Wasala, including wooden pillars with carvings, piyassa with pebbles, a central courtyard with padma boradam, and a drain system built around it. According to historical records of the Kandy era, King Sri Vikrama Rajasingha secluded Queen Rangammal in this building, and only her closest servants had the chance to see her. Despite its size, the Meda Wasala has only one room, and four copper sheets in the archaeological museum are believed to have been used as a protective spell buried in pits in the four pillars of the bed. These mantras were likely used for the protection of sexual affairs. Some flower patterns drawn on a red background have also been found under the plaster on the surface of the wall.  The Wedding Ceremony of Queen Consort The wedding ceremony of the queen consort of Kandy, as detailed in "An Account of the Interior of Ceylon, and of Its Inhabitants" by John Davy, was a grand and elaborate affair. The Adikars first determined a lucky day and hour for the celebration and lavishly decorated the queen's apartment, Meda Wasala (Sinhala: මැද වාසල). On the wedding day, the king arrived and was presented with flowers by the chiefs while the ladies rubbed sandal powder and other perfumes on his arms. The same attention was given to the bride upon her arrival. The ceremony continued for several days, during which the bride and groom underwent various traditional customs. They were bathed, dressed in saffron robes, and blessed by each member of the company as two necklaces were carried around on a gold plate. The father or nearest male relative of the bride poured water on betel leaves from a gold pot and declared that he relinquished his daughter to the king. The mother was asked if she assented, and upon answering in the affirmative, the king put a necklace around the bride's neck and clasped it. The curtain was then removed, and the bride and groom saw each other for the first time, joining their little fingers and tying the ends of their clothes together. This part of the ceremony was repeated for four successive days, and on the fourth day, the king put the second necklace on the bride and clasped it, completing the entire marriage rites. The following day, the king and queen engaged in a playful activity of throwing perfumed balls and squirting scented water at each other. Even the wives of the chiefs were allowed to participate in this activity. Afterward, the chiefs and their ladies were invited to the palace for a grand supper, during which they were entertained with performances by dancers, singing girls, and musicians. The king presided over the entertainment, seated in an elevated chair, encouraging mirth and facetious conversation. Separate dishes, including two or three hundred different kinds of curries, were served, and milk or a sweet beverage resembling lemonade was offered as a drink. The chiefs had the duty of making presents to the king and queen the following month, according to their respective ranks, situations, and means. The presents consisted of trinkets, jewels, and embroidered cloths, with each offering divided into two portions, one for the king and the other for the queen. The chiefs and their wives were invited to another supper and entertainment, during which they presented their gifts with all possible respect and attended by musicians, dancers, and singers. Overall, the wedding ceremony of the queen consort of Kandy was a joyous occasion filled with festivities and an unusual exchange of civilities, as described by John Davy. It was an extraordinary relaxation of court discipline.  Royal Consort Rididoli (Sinhala: රිදී දෝලිය), also known as secondary queen consorts or Royal Consorts, were women who held the second-highest rank among the concubines in the harem of the Kings of the Kingdom of Kandy. They were either sisters or relatives of the Randoli, the queen consort. Their sons, however, could not ascend to the throne, but their offspring were often appointed as high officials of the royal court. If the queen consort adopted their sons, they could have a chance to become the king, although in history, no son of a Rididoli was appointed as a king. Favorite consorts of the king frequently received land grants, and they used a palanquin made from silver that reflected their level in the royal household. Muttu Kannamma Devi Degal Sami and Venkata Ammal Degal Sami were the last Rididolis in the Kandyan court. During the reign of Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha of Kandy, the royal court was greatly influenced by several royal consorts, known as Rididolis. Among these influential consorts were Upendra Ammah, also known as Opiantia Ammah, and Renganaikie Ammah, who was the sister of the queen consort Alamaloo Ammah and also the sister of Ramasamy. Upendra Ammah, the cousin of Ramasamy, had a son named Coomarasamy Raja. Coomarasamy Raja was jointly adopted by Queen Consort Alamaloo Ammah and Royal Consort Renganaikie Ammah. He went on to have a son named Muttusamy Raja, who would become an important figure in the Kandyan court. The relationships and influence of these Rididolis, particularly Upendra Ammah, Renganaikie Ammah, and their adopted son Coomarasamy Raja, highlight the complex political and social dynamics of the Kandyan court during Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha's reign.  Royal Consorts Quarters The Royal Consorts Quarters, also known as the Lower Palace or Palle Wahale (Sinhala: පල්ලේ වාසල), is a historical building constructed during the Sri Vickrama Rajasingha era. It was primarily used as the quarters for the king's royal concubines, known as Ridi dolis and Yakada dolis. The main doorway leads to a small hall in front of the central building, flanked on either side by two wings. Inner verandahs on all four sides face an inner central courtyard. The windows are made of wooden poles with cracks, and legend has it that King Kirti Sri Rajasingha first resided in this building. In 1942, the building was converted into the National Museum of Kandy and is currently maintained by Department of National Museums.  Royal Concubine Yakadadoli (Sinhala: යකඩ දෝලිය) were a group of royal concubines who belonged to elite castle families known as Radala. Many of their fathers served as officials to the king, and they lived in separate mansions (Walawwa) near the royal palace. Some of them also resided in Palle Wahale, the royal consort quarters. However, their children were disqualified from inheriting the throne. Favorite concubines frequently received land grants, and their offspring were appointed as high officials of the royal court. If the queen consort, Randoli, adopted their sons, they had a chance to ascend to the throne. In one rare case, Muthukuda Devi, a Yakadadoli from Vimaladharmasuriya II of Kandy, had her son, Prince Kundasale, adopted as the son of the Madurai queen consort. He succeeded the throne on June 4, 1707, as Vira Narendra Sinha of Kandy. However, another prince from a different Yakadadoli, Prince Pattiye Bandara, who was not adopted by the queen consort, was disqualified from inheriting the throne when his brother, Prince Kundasale, was crowned as the king. One of the Yakadadoli in the harem of the Nayakkar King Kirti Sri Rajasinghe (AD 1747 - 1782) was the daughter of the Bintenne Disawe and the granddaughter of Mámpitiye Disawe. She had a very capable and popular son by the king, named Mámpitiya Bandára. However, Mámpitiya Bandara was not considered an heir to the throne. This Yakadadoli was later selected as a mistress of Kirti Sri Rajasinghe's successor, Rajádhi Rajasinghe (A. D. 1782 - 1798). As per customary law, anyone seeking refuge in the house of a Yakadadoli could not be arrested.  References  Pon Kulendiren. Sufferings of Innocent Souls: Short Stories on Human Rights Violations.

Abūʾl-Murajjā Sālim ibn al-Mustafād al-Ḥamdānī (died 1034) was the commander of Aleppo's ahdath (urban militia) during the reigns of the Mirdasid emirs Salih ibn Mirdas (r. 1024/25–1029) and Nasr ibn Salih (r. 1029–1038). He was executed by the latter in 1034 for stirring a local Muslim uprising against Aleppo's vassalage to the Christian Byzantine Empire.  Life Salim ibn al-Mustafad was the son of a ghulam (slave soldier; pl. ghilman) of Sayf al-Dawla, the Hamdanid emir of Aleppo in 945–967. Ibn al-Mustafad was a leader of the surviving Hamdanid-era ghilman when the Fatimids directly ruled Aleppo in the early 1020s. Though of foreign origins, Ibn al-Mustafad was assimilated into the Aleppine populace and resided in the al-Zajjajin (glassmakers) quarter where he likely cultivated close relationships with craftsmen, minor traders and laborers. Ibn al-Mustafad defected to the Bedouin rebel Salih ibn Mirdas when the latter besieged Aleppo in 1024. Ibn al-Mustafad rallied the ghilman and local residents and opened the Bab Qinnasrin gate to Salih's Kilabi forces on 18 January 1025. In turn, Salih guaranteed the residents' safety and appointed Ibn al-Mustafad as ra'is al-balad (municipal chief) and muqaddam al-ahdath (commander of the local militia). The ahdath consisted of young armed men from Aleppo's lower and middle-class neighborhoods. Salih then entrusted Ibn al-Mustafad and Sulayman ibn Tawq with overseeing the siege of the Aleppo Citadel where the Fatimid garrison was holed up. The latter surrendered on 30 June and all of Aleppo came under Salih's Mirdasid emirate. After Salih died, his sons Nasr and Thimal succeeded him, until the former seized complete control of Aleppo in 1030 following the Mirdasid victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Azaz. Ibn al-Mustafad remained in charge of the ahdath, but he opposed Nasr's move to make the Emirate of Aleppo a formal vassal of the Byzantine Empire in 1031. He stirred up the city's poor and middle class Muslims to protest the alliance with Byzantium, prompting the Byzantine governor of Antioch to demand Nasr execute Ibn al-Mustafad. Accordingly, he was captured and executed in 1034. It is not apparent in contemporary sources if anyone succeeded Ibn al-Mustafad as commander of the ahdath.  References   == Bibliography ==

Henry Prentiss Armsby (September 21, 1853 – October 19, 1921) was an American agricultural chemist, animal nutritionist, and academic administrator. He served as Vice Principal and Acting Principal of the Storrs Agricultural School (1881–1883), associate director of the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station (1883–1887), and director of the Agricultural Experiment Station (1887–1907) and the Institute of Animal Nutrition (1907–1921) at the Pennsylvania State University.  Early life and education Armsby was born in Northbridge, Massachusetts, on September 21, 1853, the only child of cabinetmaker Lewis Armsby and Mary A. Prentiss. Armsby earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science in 1871 and taught chemistry there for a year. He studied for two years at Yale University's Sheffield Scientific School, graduating in 1874 with his Bachelor of Philosophy degree. Following his studies at Yale, Armsby taught natural sciences at Fitchburg High School for one year. He spent the subsequent year conducting intensive research in the German city of Leipzig. Following his return to the United States, Armsby taught chemistry at Rutgers College in New Jersey from 1876 to 1877. In 1877, Samuel William Johnson hired Armsby to work as a chemist at the newly formed Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - the first in the nation - in New Haven. Armsby worked alongside Johnson's other assistant, Edward Hopkins Jenkins. Armsby worked at the Station for four years, earned his PhD from Yale in 1879, and wrote the textbook Manual of Cattle Feeding (1880), which became a staple in the field of animal nutrition.  Career In August 1881, Armsby accepted the position of Vice Principal and Professor of Agricultural Chemistry at Storrs Agricultural School, established by the Connecticut General Assembly earlier that year. Following Solomon Mead's retirement in 1882, Armsby was appointed acting principal. During a speech to the Connecticut Board of Agriculture that year, he championed the civic, scientific, and economic value of the school as a venue to produce successful farmers and community leaders. The school, he declared, was not an "asylum for incapables." His short tenure was "somewhat in the nature of marking time," according to one biographer. In 1883, Armsby resigned and Benjamin F. Koons was appointed principal beginning the winter term of 1883.  Immediately following his departure from Storrs Agricultural School, Armsby served as Professor of Agricultural Chemistry and Associate Director and Chemist of the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station from 1883 to 1887. In 1887, Armsby accepted the position of Director of the newly formed Agriculture Experiment Station at Pennsylvania State College. He remained director until 1907, when at his request he was relieved of most administrative duties to focus on research, becoming director of Penn State's new Institute of Animal Nutrition. He led the Institute until his death in 1921. Between 1895 and 1902, he pulled double duty as dean of the College of Agricultural Sciences. According to the American Journal of Nutrition, "he and Penn State grew up together." Armsby was a prolific researcher, authoring more than 115 scientific publications. Armsby was internationally renowned for creating an animal respiration calorimeter, which increased efficiency of cattle feeding, in 1901. This nutrition experiment station enabled Armsby to determine how much energy beef cattle and sheep derived from a given food source, measuring respiration, feed intake, water intake, and excrement. The device was based on a design by Wilbur O. Atwater, originally intended for human nutritional research. The first device of its kind in the world, the Armsby Calorimeter attracted visitors from all over the world and bolstered Penn State's reputation. Active in professional associations, Armsby served as the first president of the American Society of Animal Production (1908–1911), president the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations (1899), and president of the Society for the Promotion of Agricultural Science (1905–1907). He served on the editorial committee of the Journal of Agricultural Research (1914–1919). He also served on the Inter-Allied Scientific Food Commission during World War I.  Awards Armsby received widespread recognition during his lifetime. He received honorary doctorates from the University of Wisconsin (1904), Yale University (1920), and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (1921). He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society of Arts, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry. He was awarded a gold medal at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915 for his model of the calorimeter he had designed at Penn State. A U.S. Department of Agriculture report called him "the foremost exponent of research in the field of animal nutrition in the country and an international authority." Built in 1905 and named in 1956, the Armsby Building on Penn State's campus was named in his honor. Armsby's papers are held at Penn State.  Personal life Contemporaries described Armsby as reserved, modest, conscientious, gracious, and hardworking. His hobbies included bridge whist, golf, tennis, and horseback riding. He worked long hours even when his health suffered in consequence. He was a researcher first and foremost and felt administrative responsibilities to be irksome. Armsby married Lucy Atwood Harding of Millbury, Massachusetts, on October 15, 1878. The couple had five sons: Charles Lewis, Ernest Harding, Sidney Prentiss, Henry Horton, and Edward McClellan, all of whom eventually graduated from Pennsylvania State University and several of whom became academicians themselves. Armsby died of a stroke at his home on October 19, 1921. He was interred at Pine Hall Cemetery near State College. He was survived by his wife and sons.   == References ==

Douglas Croft (born Douglas Malcom Wheatcroft, August 12, 1926 – October 24, 1963) was an American teen actor who is best remembered for being the first person to portray the DC Comics character Robin, the Boy Wonder, as well as his secret identity Dick Grayson, in the 1943 serial Batman when he was 16 years old.  Early life Croft was born Douglas Malcolm Wheatcroft on August 12, 1926, in Seattle, Washington. His mother, Beatrice Hayden, married the silent film actor Stanhope Nelson Wheatcroft. They divorced in 1922, and his mother moved to San Francisco. His parents' divorce was a bitter one, and about the time he was born in August 1926, Stanhope Wheatcroft attempted to have Beatrice declared dead so that he could stop paying alimony.  Acting career Croft was living with his mother in Los Angeles in 1941. Fascinated by movie stars, a talent agent spotted him loitering near a studio and signed him up. About September 1941, he began using the stage name "Douglas Croft". He also shaved several years off his age, claiming in July 1941 and again in March 1942 that he was 11 years old. A December 1941 newspaper report listed his age as 12, when he was by then actually 15. His first role was as the pet pupil of teacher Claudette Colbert in Remember the Day. His second role was a small part in the 1942 film Kings Row, with his first major part and notable performance coming the same year in Not a Ladies' Man. His breakout role was that of the young George M. Cohan in 1942's Oscar-winning Yankee Doodle Dandy. The year 1942 also saw Croft in a substantial role as the young Lou Gehrig in The Pride of the Yankees and as Raymond in George Washington Slept Here. then as Skip in Harrigan's Kid and as Davey in Presenting Lily Mars. Croft was the first actor to play the comic book character Dick Grayson/Robin in a movie, doing so in the 1943 15-chapter movie serial Batman. As of 2024, Croft remains the youngest person (aged 16) to portray Robin in live-action, who at that time was depicted in comic books as being a young teenager. The producers made one change to the character, and that was to give Croft a wig of untamed curly hair.  Later life Croft served in the United States armed forces during World War II.  In February 1947, he was critically injured in a motorcycle accident which killed 19-year-old driver John J. Masterson. His final movie role in 1947's Killer McCoy was filmed in June or July 1947.  Death Croft died on October 24, 1963, in Los Angeles of acute alcohol intoxication and liver disease, aged 37. He was buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery near San Diego, California.

Delegates Unbound is an American non-profit political organization established in 2016. According to the organization, the group is "working to bring long term reform to the Republican Party."  Purpose The group states that its "primary focus" is educating delegates to the 2016 Republican National Convention "that they are unbound and free to vote as they see fit on all matters before the Republican National Convention, including whomever they wish to be the Republican nominee for President" in the 2016 presidential election.  Overview In June 2016, activists Eric O'Keefe and Dane Waters formed Delegates Unbound, which CNN described as "an effort to convince delegates that they have the authority and the ability to vote for whomever they want." The group is a 501(c)(4) non-profit organization. Delegates Unbound published a book, Unbound: The Conscience of a Republican Delegate, written by Republican delegates Curly Haugland and Sean Parnell. The book, funded by the Citizens in Charge Foundation, argues that "delegates are not bound to vote for any particular candidate based on primary and caucus results, state party rules, or even state law." According to the group, "There is no language supporting binding in the temporary rules of the convention, which are the only rules that matter" and "barring any rules changes at the convention, delegates can vote their conscience on the first ballot." The group's co-founder, Eric O'Keefe, said, "Our goal is simple, to ensure the delegates are not misled to believe they must follow orders or rules set by others." O'Keefe added that he believes state laws and state party rules purporting to bind delegates to a particular candidate based on primary or caucus results are unenforceable and would lose a court challenge. Delegates Unbound began airing national television advertisements in late June 2016. The group's first advertisement spliced together clips of President Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump and urged Republican delegates to follow their consciences. The group planned to spend $2.5 million to $3.5 million on education and anti-Trump efforts.

The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) Stanier Class 2 0-4-4T was a class of 10 light passenger locomotives built in 1932.  Ostensibly designed under new Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) William Stanier, they were in fact the last new design of the Midland Railway's school of engineering.  Overview The Midland Railway had a large number of 1P 0-4-4T and this was a larger version of the larger wheeled design, classified 2P.  The ten built were numbered 6400–6409 by the LMS and renumbered 1900–1909 shortly before nationalisation, freeing the numbers for new LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0s.  British Railways adding 40000 to their numbers making them 41900–41909.  Although the last new Midland-style design, as subsequent Stanier engines incorporated much Great Western Railway practice, they were not the last MR-designed locomotives built with some 4Fs appearing as late as 1940. The class was originally built with stovepipe chimneys, apparently due to an oversight by Stanier due to the design for future LMS locomotive chimneys not being finalised. All were later fitted with Stanier chimneys. Two of the locomotives were fitted with vacuum control gear in 1934 for working the motor trains on the St Alban's branch, and allocated to Watford Junction shed. The remainder were fitted in the BR period and used at a number of different sheds including Warwick and Longsight. (Motor trains was the terminology used by the LMS although they later became popularly referred to as push-pull trains. The suitably modified stock was marked as pull-push).  Details Withdrawal All were withdrawn in November 1959 except 41900, which was withdrawn in March 1962. None were preserved.  References James, Fred; Essery, Bob (2001). "The LMS 0-4-4T Engines".

Blood of Heroes is a superhero role-playing game published by Pulsar Games. It was a successor to DC Heroes and used that game's Mayfair Exponential Game System, or MEGS. Blood of Heroes is set in its own fictional world, rather than the DC universe.  Game mechanics The system features a comparative style of mechanics in which Acting Attributes are compared to Opposing Attributes on one chart, then Effect Attributes are compared to Resistance Attributes on a linked chart. It is a point-based system starting with a base of 450 Hero Points to create a character, which allows the player to design a character typical to sidekick power levels. In the system there is the option to increase this amount by 450 point amounts to make more powerful characters. Unlike the DC Heroes game, this increase does not also increase the costs of Advantages and Drawbacks.  Setting The actual world included with the game is a 1990s style superhero world with a heavy influence of occult and magical beings, which accounts for the much more detailed magic system included in the game.  Publication history After Mayfair Games stopped publishing DC Heroes, the rights to the game's mechanics were licensed to the new company Pulsar Games, who had been seeking to acquire the rights since before Mayfair went out of business.: 171  Pulsar published the superhero role-playing game Blood of Heroes (1998), which was very close to the third edition of DC Heroes without using any of the DC characters.: 171  The original Blood of Heroes was criticized for using poor artwork.: 171  A second edition, titled "Blood of Heroes: Special Edition" (pictured above) was printed in 2000 and featured expanded rules and new artwork, including cover art by Dave Dorman. Pulsar Games went out of business in 2003.: 171  In 2004 Pulsar Games was sold to new owners. Since then, nothing has been done official with the game, leaving it inactive.

Challenge square dance, also known as Challenge dancing, is modern western square dance focused on the puzzle-solving aspects of square dancing at the most difficult or "challenging" levels. In modern square dancing, the dancers interpret the caller's directions (calls) to determine whom to act with, where to go, and how to get there. All square dancers learn standard "definitions" of calls, which they recall and use when the caller issues a given command. Most square dancers learn about 100 calls. Challenge dancing involves many more calls, and the definitions and choreographic combinations are more abstract and difficult to process. The same physical movements (e.g. arm turns, passing by) are employed, but deciphering the complex commands and figuring out what you're supposed to do is much more challenging.  Levels and lists Modern western square dancing is organized into a hierarchy of standard syllabus programs (also called "levels"). Each level is described by a list of the calls that will be used, inclusive of all the material from the lower levels. The higher the program, the more material (i.e. calls) on that list, and the greater ability to recall and handle complexity is required of the dancers. The levels preceding Challenge are: Mainstream, Plus, and Advanced (A1 and A2).  There are five Challenge levels: Basic Challenge (C1), Extended Challenge (C2), Extended Challenge (C3A), Challenge 3B (C3B) and Challenge 4 (C4). The first three of these are maintained and organized by Callerlab, while the last two exist on a more ad hoc basis, maintained by a small set of interested callers.  As a result of this there are a few different C4 lists, mostly the same, but with various differences.  What makes Challenge dancing challenging? C1 dancers must be familiar with about 250 calls (including those from Mainstream, Plus, and Advanced).  By C3, the dancers must be familiar with more than 400 calls.  C4 dancers typically know at least 700 calls. Challenge square dancing not only involves knowing many more calls, but is typified by the extensive use of Concepts, abstract and physical formations,  "Phantom" dancers, and call deconstruction (such as Fractionalization). Some square dance calls are more complex than others, involving more series of actions and more abstract identifications of whom to do the action with. Challenge lists include more of these complex calls, but none are by themselves more complex than calls at the Advanced level. Much of Challenge dancing uses basic calls (such as "Right And Left Thru", or notably, "Circulate"). However, Challenge demands that the dancers have precise understanding of the call definitions, and combines and modifies calls in a way that yields more complex interpretations.  Concepts In addition to the calls which denote a particular dance action, Challenge dancing makes extensive use of "concepts" which denote modifications to calls – either how they are executed or to whom they apply. There are only a few concepts before C1, e.g., the "As Couples" concept in Advanced. Each Challenge level adds about another ten new concepts.  As with calls, the number of concepts at C4 is not as well defined. In addition, concepts can be nested, so that a call is modified by more than one.  For example, "Tandem" means that two dancers one behind the other act as one dancer, while "Stable" means that the dancers are to move from place to place as the call would normally require but without changing their facing direction as they normally would.  The caller can ask that a call be done "Stable Tandem" which means that pairs of dancers must act together to execute the call, but as they do this none of them turn.  Formations Just as Plus adds Diamonds and Advanced adds Hourglasses, Challenge dancing adds new formations which have their own rules for circulation as well as calls that apply specifically to them.   Additional formations include Butterflies, Galaxies, Triangles, Xs, and Zs. Also, many formations used at lower levels are extended to include cases where they are "distorted" – while they have the same number of dancers and the dancers follow the same rules of interaction, they are not spaced the same way.   For example, a wave may be "offset" so that the two halves are not lined up with each other, or a "parallelogram" consisting of two lines offset from each other can be considered to be two "boxes" even though the dancers in each box are not adjacent to each other.  Irregular distortions, e.g., where four arbitrary dancers not lined up in any obvious way are asked to act as a wave, may also be used.  In each case, the dancers must follow the rules of the basic call, but adjust their actual movements so that they correspond to the positions of the distorted formation.  Phantoms Challenge dancing makes extensive use of "phantoms" – imaginary dancers who hold positions in a formation that is only partially filled by real dancers.  Challenge dancers must learn to do their part of a call in a particular formation even though many of the other dancers – possibly all of them – are missing.   This requires both a clear understanding of the call definition and the ability to remember where the positions of the formation are without the usual visual and tactile cues. Calls which cause the dancers to change from one formation to another ("shape-changers") are especially challenging to dance with phantoms because the positions themselves will be changing and the entire formation may have to move to make room for other formations (even ones that have no real dancers at all to mark their position).  Fractionalization Frequent use is made in Challenge dancing of fractionalized calls, both explicitly (e.g., the caller asks the dancers to do half of something) and implicitly through concepts.   Many calls are defined to have specific "parts".   Other calls can be broken down naturally based on the nature of the movement involved (e.g., a Hinge is half of a Trade). Starting at the C1 level, concepts are introduced which operate on call parts.   For example, the "Finish" concept means to do all of the call except for the first part.  At higher levels there are meta-concepts which involve applying concepts to only certain parts of a call (e.g., "Evenly" means that only the even-numbered parts of a call should be affected by the specified concept). To properly apply these concepts, the dancer must have both an excellent understanding of the definitions of the basic calls, including how the parts are defined, and the ability to keep track in real-time of what concepts are being applied to which parts.  Challenge dancing organizations and events Clubs Some Challenge dancing is done in clubs similar to those at lower levels.  In general, because of the limited number of dancers and callers, the higher the level the fewer clubs there will be.  There are only a few cities that have clubs, with a live caller, dancing higher than C1 on a weekly basis.  Tape groups Dancers who are interested in learning or dancing a particular Challenge level often form private groups and dance using recordings.  Regional events In addition to local clubs, in many places there are events organized to offer Challenge dancing to the dancers of a larger geographic area on a less-frequent basis (e.g., monthly).  These often feature callers from other areas. Some general square dance conventions and festivals at the regional or state level include a Challenge hall, but they typically have very limited offerings above C1.  National and international events The largest Challenge event currently operating is the multi-level Academy for Advanced and Challenge Enthusiasts (AACE), held annually in June.  This event has dedicated halls for C1, C2, C3A, C3B, and C4.  (It also includes an A2 hall.) Challenge dancing is included in the much larger National Square Dance Convention (NSDC), but there is typically only one hall for Challenge and the emphasis is on the lower Challenge levels. The annual convention of the International Association of Gay Square Dance Clubs (IAGSDC) has a much more extensive Challenge program that is attended by many non-gay dancers. In Europe, the biennial iPAC (International Plus, Advanced, and Challenge) convention offers dedicated halls for all the Challenge levels. Many other events held annually at various dance facilities attract Challenge dancers from a wide area who are interested in particular levels or callers.

Lars Bjønness (born 27 July 1963) is a former Norwegian competition rower and Olympic medalist. He received a silver medal in quadruple sculls at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, together with Alf Hansen, Vetle Vinje, and Rolf Thorsen. He also received a silver medal in quadruple sculls at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, together with Kjetil Undset, Per Sætersdal, and Rolf Thorsen.  Career In 1983, Bjønness joined the Norwegian quad scull. He participated in several World Rowing Championships, and won gold in 1985, bronze in 1986 and silver 1987. The crew, which also consisted of Alf Hansen, Vetle Vinje and Rolf Thorsen, also participated at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. In that competition, the Norwegian team won both the opening and the semi-final, lost the final to Italy, and secured the silver medal by winning against the East German team. After the 1988 Olympics, Bjønness turned to double scull, where he rowed together with Thorsen. They won the World Rowing Championships in 1989. For the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, the pair returned to quad scull and was joined by Kjetil Undset and Per Sætersdal. The Norwegian team won their opening and qualified for the final with a second placed in the semi-final behind Italy. They finished behind the German team, and thus gained the silver medal. After the 1992 Olympics, Thorsen and Bjønness turned again to double scull, where they won a silver medal in 1993 World Cup and a gold in 1994. Bjønness ended his international career after winning the gold medal with Thorsen in the 1995 World Cup.

The Corn Exchange is a commercial building in the High Street in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, England. The structure, which is now used as a bookshop and as the offices of Ross-on-Wye Town Council, is a Grade II listed building.  History In the mid-19th century, a group of local businessmen decided to form a private company, known as the "Ross Corn Exchange and Public Buildings Company", to finance and commission a purpose-built corn exchange for the town. The site they selected was on the north side of the High Street. The new building was designed by Thomas Nicholson in the neoclassical style, built in ashlar stone and was completed in 1862. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of six bays facing onto the High Street. The left-hand bay contained a round headed carriage entrance with voussoirs on the ground floor, and a round headed window with an elaborate surround on the first floor. The right-hand section of five bays contained round headed openings with voussoirs and keystones on the ground floor and sash windows with segmental pediments supported by brackets on the first floor. The first-floor windows were separated by Ionic order pilasters supporting an entablature and a dentilled cornice. Internally, the principal rooms were a market hall on the ground floor and an assembly room on the first floor. The use of the building as a corn exchange declined significantly in the wake of the Great Depression of British Agriculture in the late 19th century. However, it continued to be used for public events: performers at that time included the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. It was converted for cinema use, under the branding of "The New Theatre", in 1922, and hosted performances the Ross Operatic and Dramatic Society, before it was badly damaged by a fire in 1939. After the Second World War, the interior of the building was restored by Ross-on-Wye Town Council which converted part of the structure for use as its meeting place and offices. The ground floor was re-purposed for retail use and, in 2010, became the first branch of a new chain of bookshops, Rossiter Books. A structure at the rear of the main building, which had been used as a workshop and garage, was converted into a restaurant and wedding venue by the management of the King's Head Hotel in 2022. Notable works of art in the building include a portrait by an unknown artist of the local philanthropist, John Kyrle, sometimes referred to as The Man of Ross.

Isabella Plains is a suburb in the Canberra, Australia district of Tuggeranong. The postcode is 2905.  The suburb is indirectly named after Isabella Maria Brisbane (1821–1849), who was the daughter of Sir Thomas Brisbane, the colonial Governor of New South Wales when the area was first explored by white settlers in 1823. Joseph Wild was employed by Brigade Major John Ovens and Captain Mark Currie to guide them to the Murrumbidgee River. They travelled south along the river and named the area now known as Tuggeranong "Isabella's Plain". This name was adopted, with a slight change of spelling, for the name of the new suburb.  It was gazetted on 5 August 1975. Streets are named after New South Wales parish names. It is next to the suburbs of Monash, Bonython, Richardson and Calwell. It is bounded by Isabella Drive, Drakeford Drive, Johnson Drive and Ashley Drive. Located in the suburb are a small group of shops, the senior campus of St Mary MacKillop College, Isabella Plains Primary School, the Tuggeranong automatic weather station and Isabella Plains neighbourhood oval.  Facilities Shops A small shopping centre is located on the corner of Ellerston Avenue and Galloway Street. This includes a small supermarket, a hairdresser, a Chinese restaurant, a pathology clinic, a chemist and a takeaway shop. There is also an Isabella Plains Neighbourhood house, and a small doctors surgery opposite and to the right of the shops.  Schools Government schools  Isabella Plains Primary School, a P-2 school. Isabella Plains Primary School was changed from a full primary school to a Prep - Year 2 school in 2009, due to low population. Isabella Plains residents get preference for:  Isabella Plains Early Childhood School A shared Priority Enrollment Area (PEA) of Bonython Primary, Monash Primary, and Richardson Primary Calwell High School Lake Tuggeranong College Non-government schools  St Mary MacKillop College  Community facilities An early childhood centre exists next to Isabella Plains Primary School on Ellerston Avenue, offering day care and children's health services.

Wilamowice (Polish: [vilamɔˈvit͡sɛ]; earlier Willamowice; German: Wilmesau; Wymysorys: Wymysoü [ˈvɨmɨsɔy̯]) is a rural town in southern Poland, situated in the Bielsko County, Silesian Voivodeship. The town is inhabited by a Germanic ethnic group of Vilamovians, who speak the highly endangered Wymysorys language.  History According to historians, after the desolation of Polish lands by the Mongol invasion in 1241, the then Silesian Piast rulers of the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz decided to bring settlers from the West to the deserted and destroyed lands around the Silesian Foothills, to revive agriculture, industry and trade. The area was settled in the course of the German eastward colonization of Slavic lands. In this way, around 1250, a group of colonists from the area of former Flanders came to the region, specifically from Friesland, near Bruges and established the settlement Wilamowice. The settlement was first documented in 1325, in the Peter's Pence register as the parish Novovillamowicz (New-Wilamowice) in medieval Latin, among the Catholic parishes of Oświęcim diaconate, in the Diocese of Kraków. The place name is seen as a demarcation to the older settlement Antiquo-Willamowicz (Old-Wilamowice, today named Stara Wieś). In 1529, the two place names were recorded respectively in medieval Latin as Vilamovice Nova and Antiqua Vylamovicze. In the course of history, the area has been part of several territorial border changes. Politically, both settlements—old and new, belonged to the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz, and the castellany gord of Oświęcim ceded from Lesser Poland around 1177 by duke Casimir II the Just to the duke of Opole—Mieszko I Tanglefoot, which in 1315 was formed in the process of the feudal fragmentation of Poland into the Duchy of Oświęcim, ruled by the local dukes of the Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327, the Duchy of Oświęcim became a fiefdom of the Kingdom of Bohemia within the Holy Roman Empire.  In the 15th century, Jan Długosz lists the settlement in the diocese of Kraków benefactors register Liber beneficiorum dioecesis Cracoviensis in Old Polish language Wylamowycze, in allodial lordship of the nobleman Andreas of Wilamowic (aka Wilamowski) and the heirs Johannes and Nicolaus Wilamowski. From 1527, owners of the lordship mentioned include: the nobleman Jakob Saszowski of Gieraltowic and Wilamowic, and in 1533: the nobleman and chief judge of Oświęcim Nicolaus Saszowski of Gieraltowic (aka Gierałtowski), in 1633: Christopher Korycinski (castellan of Wojnicz), between 1707 and 1719 Władysław Morsztyn and his wife Helena née Kalinowska; to the end of the 19th century the owner Psarski sold his land and rights to residents, and from there on Wilamowice became a small rural town. In 1457, duke Jan IV of Oświęcim agreed to sell the Duchy of Oświęcim to the Polish Crown, and in the accompanying document issued on 21 February the settlement was mentioned in Old Polish language Wylamowycze. It was not, however, until 1564, at the General sejm, that King Sigismund II Augustus issued privileges of incorporation, recognizing the Duchy of Oświęcim as part of the Polish Crown into the Silesian County of the Kraków Voivodeship. Since the 15th century, the names used in official chronicles were the German versions Wilmeshau and Wilmesdorf for both the new and old Wilamowice respectively. The place name was subject to several vernacular changes over the course of history, and since the 18th century the name Wilmesau in High German prevailed under the ruling Habsburg monarchy; when in 1772, upon the First Partition of Poland, it became part of the Habsburg's Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, a semi-autonomous protectorate of the Austrian Empire. After World War I and the dissolution of Austro-Hungarian monarchy, it became part of the newly independent nation of the Second Polish Republic. In 1939, after the joint Invasion of Poland by Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Free City of Danzig, the area was annexed by Germany (see Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany) in the Occupation of Poland. After the end of the Second World War, Polish territories seized by the Red Army as it advanced westward, were restored to the post-War Polish People's Republic.  Archaic dialect Due to endogamy and geographical isolation of the settlement in a Polish language region near the German linguistic enclave around Bielsko-Biala, Wilamowice formed an independent language or dialect (see: Wymysorys language) since the Late Medieval Period, which was in use in everyday life until the end of the Second World War. At the end of the War, whilst almost all Germans in the region were expelled (see Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II), in Wilmesau—the ancestral population were able to remain. The local language, however, was banned in the Polish People's Republic under the Soviet Occupation Forces and Soviet-backed communist regime, and the local population were partially Polonized. Although the language ban was lifted in 1956 during the "Polish October" revolution, attempts continued however to suppress the Wymysorys dialect from public life. Today, the Wymysorys dialect is still spoken by less than 70 native speaking residents—the elderly being the majority. The status of the Wilamowice ethnolect is complex, because according to the traditional classification it is broadly understood as a East Central dialect of High German. Nevertheless, based on the self-identification of its users as a separate group from the Germans and the existence of a literary Wymysorys language (or, to be more exact, micro-language), this ethnolect can be considered a separate language.  Notable people Florian Biesik (1849–1926), writer Józef Bilczewski (1860–1923), archbishop of Lwów Józef Gara (1929–2013), former miner turned author and poet who was the creator of the modern alphabet of Wymysorys and a collector of Wymysorys songs  Twin towns – sister cities See twin towns of Gmina Wilamowice.

Sakya Trizin Ngawang Kunga served as the 41st Sakya Trizin, the throne holder of the Sakya Lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, from his appointment in 1952 until his retirement in 2017. His religious name is Ngawang Kunga Tegchen Palbar Trinley Samphel Wangyi Gyalpo (Tibetan: ངག་དབང་ཀུན་དགའ་ཐེག་ཆེན་དཔལ་འབར་འཕྲིན་ལས་བསམ་འཕེལ་དབང་གྱི་རྒྱལ་པོ།, Wylie: ngag dbang kun dga' theg chen dpal 'bar 'phrin las bsam 'phel dbang gyi rgyal po). After passing the throne of the Sakya lineage to his elder son Ratna Vajra Rinpoche who became the 42nd Sakya Trizin on 9 March 2017, he is now known as Kyabgon Gongma Trichen Rinpoche.  Biography Ngawang Kunga was born on September 7, 1945 in Tsedong, near Shigatse, Tibet. From his father, Vajradhara Ngawang Kunga Rinchen, he received important initiations and teachings in the Sakya lineage. He began intensive religious study at the age of five. In 1952, he was officially designated as the next Sakya Trizin by the Fourteenth Dalai Lama. He continued intensive training from his main teacher Ngawang Lodroe Shenpen Nyingpo and many other famous Tibetan scholars, studying extensively in both the esoteric and exoteric Buddhist traditions. In 1959, at the age of fourteen, he was formally enthroned as head of the Sakya Order of Tibetan Buddhism. In the same year, due to the violent take over by China and the ensuing political situation in Tibet, Sakya Trizin Ngawang Kunga, his family, and many lamas and monks from the Sakya Monastery relocated to India. To maintain the unbroken lineage of the Khon family, in 1974 he consented to requests that he accept Tashi Lhakee, daughter of a noble family from Derge in Kham as his consort. In the same year his first son, Ratna Vajra Rinpoche, was born. In 1979, a second son, Gyana Vajra Rinpoche was born. After leaving Tibet, in 1964, Sakya Trizin Ngawang Kunga re-established the seat of the Sakya in Rajpur, India, building a monastery known as Sakya Centre. Since that time, he has worked tirelessly to preserve the thousand-year-old religious heritage of the Sakya Order and to transmit its teachings to succeeding generations. He founded and directly guides a number of institutions, including Sakya Monastery in Rajpur, Sakya Institute, Sakya College, Sakya Nunnery, Sakya College for Nuns, Sakya Tibetan Settlement, Sakya Hospital, dozens of other monasteries and nunneries in Tibet, Nepal, and India, and numerous Dharma Centers in many countries. Kyabgon Gongma Trichen Rinpoche is regarded as one of the most highly qualified Buddhist lineage holder respected by all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism and teaches widely throughout the world. He has bestowed the extensive Lam Dre teaching cycle, which is the most important teaching of the Sakya Order over 18 times on various continents, and also transmitted major initiation cycles such as Collection of all the Tantras, and the Collection of all the Sādhanās, which contain almost all of the empowerments for the esoteric practices of the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism to hundreds of lineage holders in the next generation of Buddhist teachers. He has trained both of his sons as highly qualified Buddhist masters, and they both travel widely, teaching Buddhism throughout the world. The year 2009 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the 41st Sakya Trizin's leadership of the Sakya Order. The occasion was celebrated as a Golden Jubilee with extensive celebrations and tributes to his success in preserving and maintaining the Sakya school.  References Bibliography Penny-Dimri, Sandra.

Royal Raymond Rife (May 16, 1888 – August 5, 1971) was an American inventor and early exponent of high-magnification time-lapse cine-micrography. Rife is known for his microscopes, which he claimed could observe live microorganisms with a magnification considered impossible for his time, and for an "oscillating beam ray" invention, which he thought could treat various ailments by "devitalizing disease organisms" using radio waves. Although he came to collaborate with scientists, doctors and inventors of the epoch, and his findings were published in newspapers and scientific journals like the Smithsonian Institution annual report of 1944, they were later rejected by the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Cancer Society (ACS) and mainstream science. Rife's supporters continue to claim that impulses of electromagnetic frequencies can disable cancerous cells and other microorganisms responsible for diseases. Most of these claims have no scientific research to back them up and Rife machines are not approved for treatment by health authorities in the world. Multiple promoters have been convicted of health fraud and sent to prison.  Life and work Little reliable published information exists describing Rife's life and work. In the 1930s, he made several optical compound microscopes and, using a movie camera, took time-lapse microscopy movies of microbes. He also built microscopes that included polarizers.  Rife claimed magnifications of 17,000× or more for some of these microscopes. A report published by the Smithsonian Institution described one of these microscopes as equipped for "transmitted and monochromatic beam dark-field, polarized, and slit-ultra illumination, including also a special device for crystallography". It added that several doctors had attended a demonstration of another of Rife's microscopes and had been impressed by its clarity and high magnification. Some of the observations Rife claimed to have made with his microscopes are, however, contradicted by modern findings. For instance, he reported that under certain conditions typhoid bacteria changed into a much smaller form, and claimed that most cancerous tumours contained a microbe that had no less than five forms, one of which was indistinguishable from E. coli while another resembled a fungus. Rife also reported that a 'beam ray' device of his invention could destroy microbial pathogens. Rife claimed to have documented a "Mortal Oscillatory Rate" for various pathogenic organisms, and to be able to destroy the organisms by vibrating them using radio waves of this particular frequency. According to the San Diego Evening Tribune in 1938, Rife stopped short of claiming that he could cure cancer, but did argue that he could "devitalize disease organisms" in living tissue, "with certain exceptions". In a 1931 profile, Rife warned against "medical fakers" who claim to cure disease using "electrical 'vibrations'", stating that his work did not uphold such claims.  An obituary in the Daily Californian described his death at the age of 83 on August 5, 1971, stating that he died penniless and embittered by the failure of his devices to garner scientific acceptance. Rife blamed the scientific rejection of his claims on a conspiracy involving the American Medical Association (AMA), the Department of Public Health, and other elements of "organized medicine", which had "brainwashed and intimidated" his colleagues.  Health fraud after his death Interest in Rife's claims was revived in some alternative medical circles by the 1987 book by Barry Lynes, The Cancer Cure That Worked, which claimed that Rife had succeeded in curing cancer, but that his work was suppressed by a powerful conspiracy headed by the American Medical Association.  The American Cancer Society (ACS) describes Lynes' claims as implausible, noting that the book was written "in a style typical of conspiratorial theorists", and that Lynes "... cites names, dates, events and places, giving the appearance of authenticity to a mixture of historical documents and speculations selectively spun into a web far too complex to permit verification by any thing short of an army of investigators with unlimited resources."  After this book's publication, a variety of devices bearing Rife's name were marketed as cures for diverse diseases such as cancer and AIDS. An analysis by Electronics Australia found that one typical 'Rife device' cost AU$105 for a rudimentary circuit that simply produced a tiny pulsed electrical current (at a single fixed frequency of about 40kHz).  It consisted of a nine-volt battery, wiring, a switch, a standard 555 timer chip and two short lengths of copper tubing meant to act as handheld electrodes, delivering a current which the author estimated at 1 milliamp at most.  Its design was, in fact, almost identical to the "zapper" device promoted by Hulda Clark, rather than having much in common with Rife's original devices.  He described this as "the tip of an enormous iceberg", with a wide range of more elaborate devices also on sale from different suppliers, varying widely in design and ranging in price from AU$1,500 to AU$34,000.   Such 'Rife devices' have figured prominently in several cases of health fraud in the U.S., typically centered around the uselessness of the devices and the grandiose claims with which they are marketed. In a 1996 case, the marketers of a 'Rife device' claiming to cure numerous diseases including cancer and AIDS were convicted of felony health fraud. The sentencing judge described them as "target[ing] the most vulnerable people, including those suffering from terminal disease" and providing false hope. In some cases cancer patients who ceased chemotherapy and instead used these devices have died. A Washington State couple Donald and Sharon Brandt, who operated a clandestine health-care clinic from their home in Mount Vernon based on Rife's inventions were convicted for a short imprisonment period. Rife devices are currently classified as a subset of radionics devices, which are generally viewed as  pseudomedicine by mainstream experts. In Australia, the use of Rife machines has been blamed for the deaths of cancer patients who might have been cured with conventional therapy.  In 2002 John Bryon Krueger, who operated the Royal Rife Research Society, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for his role in a murder and also received a concurrent 30-month sentence for illegally selling Rife devices. In 2009 a U.S. court convicted James Folsom of 26 felony counts for sale of the Rife devices sold as 'NatureTronics', 'AstroPulse', 'BioSolutions', 'Energy Wellness', and 'Global Wellness'.  Legacy In 1994, the American Cancer Society's journal CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians criticized Rife's methods and devices in an article titled "Questionable Methods of Cancer Management: Electronic Devices". The ACS reported that Rife machines were being sold in a "pyramid-like, multilevel marketing scheme". A key component in the marketing of Rife devices has been the claim, initially put forward by Rife himself, that the devices were being suppressed by an establishment conspiracy against cancer "cures". Although 'Rife devices' are not registered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and have been linked to deaths among cancer sufferers, The Seattle Times reported that over 300 people attended the 2006 Rife International Health Conference in Seattle, where dozens of unregistered devices were sold.  Cancer Research UK, the world's largest independent cancer research charity, has stated: "There is no reliable evidence that the Rife machine works as a cure for cancer.... There is also no evidence that it doesn't cause harm.... Many websites promote the Rife machine as a cure for cancer. But no reputable scientific cancer organisations support any of these claims." A 2000 article in The Sydney Morning Herald warned: "Cancer sufferers have died after putting their faith in a device with electrical parts worth just $15" (equivalent to $27 in 2023), further reporting that Rife machines are "unanimously condemned as worthless by mainstream scientists and banned in at least two American States."

ASIL Lysi (Greek: ΑΣΙΛ Λύσης) is a Cypriot football club which was established in the town of Lysi, Famagusta. After the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, ASIL became a refugee team and is temporarily based in Larnaca. The club plays in the Second Division.  History The club was founded in Lysi, Famagusta on June 26, 1932. Club founders were Ch. Fokaides, Ch. Panayides, K. Rousi and N. Petrou. The choice for the club's name is attributed to Demetris Lambrou. The club had its own stadium in Lysi. The stadium was called «Grigoris Afxentiou Stadium» as a memory of EOKA hero Grigoris Afxentiou who was born in Lysi and he was a player of ASIL. ASIL stadium was one of the first stadiums in Cyprus with grass. After the 1974 Turkish invasion, ASIL used Tsirion Stadium in Limassol as its ground and since 1978 the club is based in Larnaca. Since 1984 ASIL has a new stadium in Larnaca called «Grigoris Afxentiou Stadium». In 2019–20 season ASIL used AEK Arena as its ground and since 2020–21 season ASIL uses GSZ Stadium. The best season for the club was 1968–69 in which they finished 6th in the first division.  Colours and badge The club colours are yellow and black.

Élie (or Elias) Bouhéreau (1643 – 19 March 1719) was a French Huguenot refugee in Ireland and the first librarian of Marsh's Library in Dublin.  Career Bouhéreau, according to the burial register of the Conformist Huguenot churches in Dublin, was a "distinguished medical doctor and zealous Protestant of La Rochelle, very knowledgeable and very highly regarded."  He was also a scholar, and published a French translation of the third century Christian work Contra Celsus.  After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes Bouhéreau fled to England.  He travelled in Europe between 1689 and 1692 as personal secretary of Thomas Coxe, the king's envoy to the Swiss cantons, and again between 1694 and 1696 as personal secretary to the Marquis de Ruvigny, commander-in-chief of English forces in Piedmont. He served in Ireland with Ruvigny (then earl of Galway) when the latter was Lord Justice of Ireland, 1697-1701. In 1701 he was made librarian of Marsh's Library.  From the time of his first journey in 1689 to his death he kept a diary, which is kept in the Library.  Conservation work Bouhéreau had with him documents from the Reformed Church of France, which he had brought from La Rochelle to save them from destruction.  They were deposited at Marsh's library, the governors stipulating "that they were to be kept until such time as the same shall be demanded by the said Reformed Church."  In 1760 John Wynne, the third librarian, expressed himself "apprehensive lest the papists might have access to make bad use of or destroy them."  They were finally returned to the Consistory of La Rochelle in 1862.  There are still many works in Bouhéreau's collection in the library that deal with French Huguenot history, including the manuscript of Joseph Guillaudeau's Journal of What Passed at La Rochelle 1584-1643.  Personal life Bouhéreau was married to a cousin, Marguerite Massiot.  They had ten children, of whom eight survived. His son John was ordained a minister, became a Doctor of Divinity and was the first assistant librarian of Marsh's Library.  Marguerite died on 22 May 1704.  Her death occasioned an emotional entry in an otherwise factual diary. One of the sons, Richard was Town Major (police chief) of Dublin. His son Richard changed his surname to Borough. That Richard's son, of the same name, was the first of the Borough baronets, from 1813.   == References ==

The Church of the Holy Innocents is a heritage-listed Anglican church at 130 Rossmore Avenue West, Rossmore, City of Liverpool, New South Wales, Australia. It was designed by Richard Cromwell Carpenter and Edmund Blacket and built from 1848 to 1850 by William Munro. The property is owned by Anglican Church Property Trust Diocese of Sydney, though it was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 August 2018.  History Traditional owners The original inhabitants of the Liverpool area were the Gandangara people. The pre-European landscape of the area consisted of open eucalyptus woodland. Across this country the Gandangara people utilised many of the flora and fauna resources during everyday life. Many aspects of the local landscape would have held spiritual importance for the Gandangara people. It is unknown if the land upon which the Cabramatta village or the church lands associated with the Church of the Holy Innocents was used for any specific economic, settlement, or spiritual/sacred purposes by the Gandangara.  British settlement From the early 1800s European settlers began to encroach on Gandangara lands and settle on what they named the Liverpool plains. Directly organised British colonisation of the area commenced in the 1810s during the governorship of Macquarie (1810–1821) through the alienation of land and the imposition of the rule of British law. Land alienation proceeded through the issuing of large land grants to prominent settlers who had the means to establish extensive stock runs. This resulted in the area being sparsely settled with family estates dotted throughout the landscape. These stock runs were often quite isolated with the main meeting and social places being the few local churches or other public amenities such as stores, pubs, and post offices situated along the main thoroughfares of the region. Colonisation of the area continued during the 1820s and 1830s under Governors Brisbane (1821–1825) and Darling (1825–1831). However, by the mid-1820s there was a change in the surveying system of the colony undertaken under the orders of Lord Bathurst, which took a more progressive outlook to the future of the colony. This was in response to difficulties in the land surveying department in the early and mid-1820s where the surveying of the numerous grants allocated by Governors Macquarie and Brisbane had not yet been carried out. Lord Bathurst's plan required that the colony be systematically surveyed and split up into counties, hundreds, and parishes and that township, village, public road, school, burial ground, and church reserves be situated in appropriate locations for future need as the local population increased and more free settlers immigrated to the colony. This systematic survey of the entire colony, the Nineteen Counties or the Limits of Location, was eventually carried out by Major Thomas Livingstone Mitchell, Surveyor General from 1828.: 196–197  Overall, the imposition of this settlement model on the Australian landscape was one of the early attempts by the British authorities to recreate a British agricultural landscape, dotted with small farms and villages, in the colony. Lord Bathurst's also ordered that one-seventh of the land of each county, according to extent and value, was to be put aside as the Clergy and School Estate. The purpose of this estate was to fund and support the Established Church of England and its clergy in the colony, as well as the education of the colony's youth in Anglican principals. To manage these grants, Lord Bathurst detailed that a Clergy and School Lands Corporation should be established to manage their sale, which would then provide funds for the religious and educational development of the colony.: 197  During the surveying of the colony a township reserve was situated in the Parish of Cabramatta, within the County of Cumberland, located to the southwest of Liverpool on the east bank of South Creek. This township was also named Cabramatta and formed the only township reserve allocated to this parish, as the remainder had been granted away during the 1810s and early 1820s. This township reserve was close to the estates of Horningsea Park (Joshua John Moore) and Cow-de-knaves (John Jamieson) and in 1830 the Bellfield Farm estate was established to its north. A school and church reserve was allocated to the Cabramatta village reserve when it was created around 1827. This reserve was one acre in size and came, over time, to comprise an eastern half for a school and church and a western half for a burial ground. Due to the excesses of Governor Macquarie with regard to the construction of public buildings in Sydney and other areas of the colony during his period in office, Colonial officials in London dictated that public needs be met more modestly by Governor Brisbane during his tenure. As a result of this and Lord Bathurst's new plan for the surveying of the Colony, Brisbane established the Clergy and School Lands Corporation in 1826 to manage the provision of education and religious needs to the colony. This corporation was run by a committee of Anglicans which included Archdeacon Thomas Hobbs Scott, the Reverend Samuel, and three prominent Anglican laymen. One of its goals was to provide simple schools and rectories for the local populations in rural areas. It was to have been financed by the sale of the Clergy and School Estate lands, as well as other investments, but funds were slow to be amassed via this method since no land was allocated to the corporation until 1828 (due to issues in the colonial surveying department). As a result, the corporation had only limited funds to operate during its early years. Thus, they operated by building modest, often timber, vernacular buildings in places of need that could serve as both schools and churches. To facilitate this the architects, Joshua Thorp and William Aird, provided the corporation with some designs for simple chapels and school-church buildings. Ultimately, the Clergy and School Lands Corporation was not a success and its activities were suspended in 1829, before its charter was finally revoked in 1833, following complaints from the other denominations about the dominance of the Anglicans.: 68–69, 71–75  In 1827 the Clergy and School Lands Corporation built a simple slab timber school/church hall on the southeast corner of the church reserve in Cabramatta township. This small building was typical of those constructed by the corporation in rural areas to serve the educational and religious needs of these small communities. The hall had a capacity of 100 people and from its opening the acting school master was the Reverend A. Lideliard. This new hall was located in the vast parish of the Cow Pastures which was under the stewardship of the Reverend Thomas Hassall (1794–1868) from its conception in 1826. It is likely that Hassall occasionally visited this hall to perform services as he toured his parish, with regular services being conducted by a local curate. Soon after the construction of the school/church hall in 1828 the building required further additions and repairs. These works were carried out by an Edward Pender and consisted of laying flooring and skirting, providing church furniture (sofas, a table, and seating for children), and lining and jams for the windows and doors. By 1829 the building was being used once every Sunday for services and in 1830 Reverend Hassall was noted as being the rector or officiating minister of Cabramatta which still had a population of a 100. This suggests that in the years following its construction the hall was used by the populations of the surrounding estates regularly for worship and teaching, along with perhaps other community purposes. Education was the purview of the Church of England during this period and it is likely that the local minister, Reverend Hassall, arranged for the appointment of a qualified headmaster or mistress of the school. After the school/church hall at Cabramatta was erected a cemetery was established at the rear of the school and church reserve. The first recorded burial in this cemetery was a four-month old baby boy, William Fox, on 22 November 1829. This burial and several others during the 1830s and 1840s were registered at surrounding churches (such as St Lukes, Liverpool). It is possible that earlier burials from 1825 or 1827 onwards occurred in the church grounds, but these were unregistered. From 1848, when new lands were granted to the Anglican Church under the Church Act for the construction of the Church of the Holy Innocents, this cemetery was officially granted as a burial ground and a register of burials kept from 1851. Despite the repairs made in 1828, by 1832 the slab timber school/church hall was beginning to fall into disrepair and Archdeacon William Broughton advised Reverend Hassall that the building needed to be repaired or demolished. Consequently, in December 1832, Hassall commissioned substantial repairs to the hall by Joseph Heron to improve the buildings suitability as a church. The documentation for these repairs reveals that the building had a school room and two small "back" rooms. At this time there was still one chaplain (Hassall) servicing Cabramatta and the surrounding region, which was now described as the Cook district and also included Mulgoa, South Creek, Camden, and Stone Quarry Creek. The following year (1833) Robert Bell, the owner of the estate to the north adjoining the Cabramatta town reserve, petitioned the government to finally establish a township and offer the town allotments at auction. Bell hoped to add to his estate through this process and provide himself with a road access to his property via Bringelly Road. Following this request the government further investigated the site, but the Surveyor General reported to the Colonial Secretary that the reserve was not on the great road, was "ill-watered" and, therefore, not suitable for the establishment of a town. Consequently, it was not until 1840 that the town allotments were put up at auction and Robert Bell was able to purchase the majority to add to his estate.  Plans for a permanent church at Cabramatta In 1836 the local Anglican community were using the hall (log built school house) for services on a fortnightly basis with its capacity being recorded as 60 people. The passing of the Church Act this year encouraged Bishop Broughton to begin plans to construct a permanent and substantial church at Cabramatta for this district. At this time the populations of the surrounding estates were growing and a need was seen for a more permanent and auspicious church. Two hundred pounds was soon subscribed, mainly by the local population, for the cost of this church. The local community felt that this new church should be dedicated to the Holy Innocents. This name indicates the "high church" leanings of the local congregation and their designs for the church. In contrast "low church" churches are normally named after saints. The Feast of the Holy Innocents, after which the church is named, is more of an orthodox catholic tradition. Governor Burke's (1831–1837) 1836 Church Act granted state recognition and support for the main denominations operating in Australia: the Church of England, Presbyterian Church, and Catholic Church. It provided extra funding through a pound for pound subsidy for new churches costing between 600 and 2000 pounds. However, before a church could be built the local area was required to prove, through a petition, that at least 150 residents of the particular denomination were present and would use and support the church. This Act was designed to forward the construction of churches of these denominations across the colony while also providing funding for the stipends of ministers and, generally, improve the moral condition of the still largely convict population. To further encourage new church construction the Act also made additional land grants available for churches and schools. However, it required new churches to be designed by a professional architect and approved by the colonial architect. Through recognising and assisting other denominations this Act served to diminish the power of the Church of England in Australia, which had previously been the de facto Established Church of the colony. This was especially so after Bourke later extended the Act to include the Methodist, Wesleyan, and Baptist Christian denominations, as well as Judaism. In this manner, the Act helped to foster a religious pluralism in the colony.: 58 : 99–101  Broughton had arrived in Australia in 1829 to fill the post of Archdeacon of NSW. He was a High Churchman and firm supporter of the Church of England and would not countenance deviation from its established rules in the colony. At the time of his arrival there were only eight parish churches in the colony (of which the majority had been constructed by Macquarie) and Broughton soon sought to remedy this situation. When back in England in 1835–1836 he organised for an annual 1000 pound grant from the English Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, as well as other immediate gifts, that allowed him to bring clergy to Australia and begin the work of building churches and rectories throughout the colony. As an amateur architect and enthusiast in ecclesiological architecture Broughton also procured suitable drawings and working plans for churches. While the 1836 Church Act gave considerable impetus to church expansion, great organisation was required to see a church constructed, and Bishop Broughton was a tireless and long travelling organiser who helped see the construction of many churches. He consecrated or dedicated almost a hundred church buildings throughout his long episcopate career demonstrating his organisational skills and dedication to this cause.: 100–101  In 1836 Broughton was elevated to the Bishopric of the new see of Australia. Just prior to this, in 1835, he had been exposed to the work of the Oxford scholars that came to be known as Tractarians. Although Broughton never considered himself a Tractarian, he was influenced by their work and sympathised with and supported them by giving them appointments where possible. This support of the Tractarians, and by extension the Cambridge Camden Society, led Broughton to establish Gothic architecture as the most suitable for ecclesiological architecture in the colony. Prior to the mid-1830s gothic ornamentation had only been used on the exterior of new churches in an amateur fashion and it was only just beginning to be seen as a suitable style for "modern" ecclesiological architecture. This state of affairs continued into the early 1840s due to a lack of skilled tradesmen and competent and knowledgeable architects, despite the incentives of the Church Act. It was not until the mid-1840s that an influx of Scottish tradesmen and architects such as Edmund Blacket began to alleviate this situation. Prior to this the Anglican Church Act norm had been small symmetrical churches with almost double cube proportions, symmetrical north and south porches placed midway along the length of the church, western bell-cotes, and detailing such as buttresses, hood-moulds, and pinnacles. From the 1840s there was a definitive move toward medievalism in Anglican ecclesiological architecture as the Gothic Revival movement took hold in the colony and by the mid-1840s there was a definite commitment to archaeological fidelity (a commitment to correct medieval detail) in gothic architecture.  The construction of the Church of the Holy Innocents Throughout the early 1840s efforts continued towards the construction of a permanent church at Cabramatta, but it appears that funds were slow to be raised due to the collapse of the colonial wool industry. This is likely as many of the local large estates holders were among those who subscribed towards the construction of the church, including the holders of "Vermont (J. J. Riley Esq)", "Berling (Mrs S. Lowe)", "Bellfield (Robert Bell Esq)", "Retreat Farm (Alfred Kennerley Esq)", "Newstead", "Eastwood", "Wilton Park (A. J. Lidingtone)", and "Exeter Farms". In 1845 when the Reverend George Vidal was appointed to the Parish of Denham Court and the Cabramatta area was subsumed into this parish it was reported that services at the school/church hall were held fortnightly and attended by an average of 20 people. However, while services were held as Cabramatta regularly, confirmations and marriages were held at St Mary's Denham Court. Despite the incentive of the Church Act and the assistance of Bishop Broughton it took the local congregation and the Anglican Church until 1846 before the necessary funds (311 pounds) were gathered to commence the design and construction of the new church at Cabramatta. Bishop Broughton chose a Gothic Revival design produced by one of the Cambridge Camden Society's leading architects, Richard Cromwell Carpenter. Carpenter had designed and built St John the Baptist Church at Cookham Dean in Berkshire, England in 1844–45 and it was a copy of this design that Bishop Broughton had acquired through Reverend William Horatio Walsh, a correspondent of the Society's journal. Reverend Walsh had met Edmund Blacket when he had been appointed to finish Christ Church St Laurence in 1843 and been introduced to Gothic architecture by him. They, subsequently, became close friends as Christ Church was Blacket's parish church and Reverend Walsh, therefore, his Rector and one of his great supporters. The finished design of Christ Church in 1845 was unapologetically High Church and Tractarian and caused a great scandal among the Evangelical Anglicans in the colony . Reverend Walsh became a leader among the colonial Tractarians, which explains his promotion of Carpenter's Gothic Revival inspired church design to Bishop Broughton. The Church of St John the Baptist, Cookham Dean, had been described and lauded in the societies' journal "The Ecclesiologist" when it was completed in 1845, to which Bishop Broughton and other members of the colonial clergy subscribed. In this article it was described as a fourteenth century style church of "a very simple" and "most satisfactory design" but "not mean or starved" and "of unpretending but solemn character". It is highly likely that it was these properties of the design that brought it to Broughton's attention and inspired him to acquire copies of the drawings. Previously a copy of this design had been acquired by Bishop Nixon of Tasmania and it was used to construct a church at Buckland, Tasmania between August 1846 and January 1849.: 58 : 29 : 10, 43  Edmund Blacket, soon after his arrival in the Colony in 1842, had come to the attention of Broughton. He subsequently made use of Blacket's knowledge of Gothic architecture to further his plans to provide proper ecclesiological buildings within his diocese. Blacket, as Diocese Architect, amended and drew up the construction plans for the new Cabramatta church based on the Carpenter design provided to him by Bishop Broughton. The dictates of Gothic Revival architecture at this time commended and encouraged the authentic replication of medieval designs. In this tradition Blacket kept most of the prominent elements of Carpenter's design, while decreasing the size of the church, changing its construction materials from stone to brick, adding to some aspects of the design, and designing the interior nave and chancel furniture and trimmings. He likely also set out the tracery geometry for the building. Blacket also definitely designed the beautiful fourteen century style stone font as this design is extant within his papers at the Mitchell Library. In this manner, the Church of the Holy Innocents remained an authentic Carpenter design while being adapted to an Australian location and landscape. In December 1849 Blacket became the Colonial Architect and in this capacity had the responsibility of supervising the continued construction of the church.: 9  Prior to the construction of the church, a survey was undertaken of the church lands in March 1848 in association with the granting of additional lands for the new church under the Church Act (this included the original church reserve). Following this grant the church lands now comprised three acres which were described as: two roods for a school house associated with the United Church of England and Ireland; two roods for a dwelling house, garden, and other appurtenances for the clergyman; and one acre for a burial ground. The trustees of these church lands were John Campbell, James John Riley, and Edward Lummas Moore. Two road reserves were also added to the Cabramatta town plan to the east and west of the new church lands at this time. The foundation stone for the Church of the Holy Innocents was laid on 28 December 1848 (Holy Innocents Day) by Bishop Broughton with an accompanying ceremony. Holy Innocents Days or the Feast of the Holy Innocents is a festival held by the Christian Churches that commemorates or mourns the massacre of male children by King Herod during his attempts to kill the infant Jesus (the Slaughter of the Innocents). These children were considered to be the first martyrs by the early church. For some years prior to this the local congregation had continued having services in the school/church hall and on this day a service was held in the building that was officiated by the Reverend George Vidal. Bishop Broughton's speech at the ceremony was somewhat political in tone, referring to recent events that had eroded the position of the Church of England as the colony:  'We have here the rudimens [sic] of a mighty empire. But what would be its greatness, or how could any country be great except so far as the national character was formed and directed by Gospel truth. If they looked to England, which at this moment exhibited a spectacle of order and firmness which excited the wonder of the surrounding nations, to what were they to attribute this. It might be said to the excellency of the national institutions. But they ought to go back to a cause which lay deeper than this to that upon which those institutions themselves rested: to the continued adherence of England to the fear of God, and to the principles of the reformed catholic faith which still lived in the affections of the people and ruled their hearts, and influenced their conduct, and similar results must not be expected in this country, unless attachment to the Church were as extensively disfussed [sic] among its inhabitants.' It is likely that Broughton was making a statement with the design and construction of this church about the status of the Church of England in colonial society and what its future directions should be (i.e. High Church and Tractarian). Its first reverend, George Vidal, was a recognised "High Churchman" and Tractarian and was sympathetic to the ideals of Bishop Broughton and the Camden Cambridge Society.: 41  Construction of the church began immediately afterwards and was overseen by the builder William Monroe. Monroe was a local Liverpool builder already with some experience in church construction within the local area. He had immigrated to the colony in the early 1840s as part of a scheme to encourage tradesmen to settle in the colony. Munro's detailed accounts of the building works are extant at the NSW State Archives, which shows that he was a skilled and experienced builder and able to produce a first rate result with minimal drawings and supervision. His later building work included a Catholic church at Berrima that brought him to the attention of Bishop Polding who became his patron. Throughout the 1840s and 1850s he steadily gained in experience so that he could act as an architect and by the late 1850s he had been appointed Diocese Architect of the Sydney Catholic Church, a position he served throughout the 1860s. Later in 1873 he also acted as the architect for the Presbyterian College of St Andrew at Sydney University. However, he has been described as a poor architect, despite his experience in building a number of churches designed by prominent architects.: 91–92, 204, 257  According to the common procedures of the Church Act the construction work was regularly inspected by Edmund Blacket acting as Colonial Architect. His inspections allowed him to certify the accounts for the construction and report to the Colonial Secretary so the government funds for the work, 350 pounds, could be paid out. The church was completed in October 1850, just under two years after the commencement of construction, and it was consecrated by Bishop Broughton on 7 November 1850. The following year a brief report appeared in the Ecclesiologist, authored by Canon Horatio Walsh, describing its small nature but commenting that "its forms and details within and without show[ing] a most satisfactory example of ecclesiological development".: 58  Operation of the Church of the Holy Innocents Throughout its life the Church of the Holy Innocents at Cabramatta, and then Rossmore, has been situated in two Parishes: Denham Court and Cobbitty. It was attached to the Parish of Denham Court up until 1877 when it was moved into the boundaries of the Parish of Narellan-Cobbitty. It was then moved back into the boundaries of the Parish of Denham Court in 1901. From 1901 to 1925 this "parish" was known as the Mission District of Denham Court and Rossmore (which included Minto until 1916). In 1926 Denham Court and Rossmore were made a parish. At the time of the construction of the Church of the Holy Innocents the incumbent for the Parish of Denham Court was the Reverend George Vidal (1815–1878) who became one of the High Churchmen of the colony. He is known to have had some sympathy for the ideals of the Cambridge Camden Society and Tractarianism. Reverend Vidal was ordained by Bishop Broughton as a Deacon in 1840 and as a Priest in 1841 before being appointed to the Parish of Denham Court in 1846. He remained in this parish, serving at St Mary the Virgin Church at Denham Court and the Church of the Holy Innocents at Cabramatta until 1855 when he was transferred to the parish of Mulgoa (near Penrith). In 1867 he was appointed incumbent of Christ Church, St Laurence, Sydney and soon after appointed a canon. He remained in this position until his death in 1878.: 204 : 41  After the construction of the Church of the Holy Innocents the original timber slab school/church hall continued to be used as a community hall (and possibly a school) until c.1886 when a new weatherboard and galvanised iron hall was built. This was during the early years of the Parish of Cobbitty's management of the church. This new Church Hall was intended to serve as a place where community gatherings could be held and funds raised for the upkeep of the church and church yard. From 1902 the hall was also used as a school until 1920 when Rossmore Public School was established on the opposite side of Bringelly Road, During WWII the hall was again used as a government school for a brief period from 1939 onwards. Community gatherings continued to be held in the hall until 1982 before the building was demolished in 1987. The current brick rectory to the southeast of the churchyard was constructed in the same year with the Reverend Ross Nicholson serving as the first curate. The old school/church hall was not demolished when the new church hall was built in the 1880s and it appears to have continued in some form of use up until 1931 when it was destroyed by bushfires according to oral tradition.  Appendix 1: The Tractarian Movement and Cambridge Camden Society The early nineteenth century was a time of revolution in doctrine and liturgy for the Church of England as it faced challenges to its dominance and a curtailment of its privileges in Britain as the UK moved more towards secularism and religious pluralism. These changes led many Anglicans to fight back against what they saw as unjust attacks against the proper English Church and attempt to revitalise it to restore its prominence. The Oxford or Tractarian movement, named after their publication "Tracts for the Times", was formed at Oxford in 1833 as a new school of churchmanship. Initially, it was a focussed on ascertaining the rightful position and nature of the Church of England within contemporary society. It had been formed as a protest against the State and liberal pressure being directed against the Church of England at the time and was part of the Church taking stock of its purpose and mission. However, as it rapidly grew and was influenced by the Romantic Movement it morphed into a widespread affirmation of the spiritual and historical integrity and apostolic character of the Church of England. It insisted that the sacramental character of the Church be given proper reverence. The movement argued for the reinstatement of some older Christian traditions of faith and their inclusion into Anglican liturgy and theology. Overall, Tractarianism focussed on the Catholic heritage of the church and the apostolic succession, espoused that the liturgical emphasis should be on the sacraments, and was strongly opposed to any segregation in church based on social differentiation. At this time the liturgical emphasis of the Church of England was on the spoken word with the pulpit being the focus of attention and there was commonly social segregation through the use of rented pews for the wealthy and open galleries for the poor.: 25–26 : 29–30 : 29  The emphasis of Tractarianism on the sacraments reflected the devotion of the movement to the supernatural. For them the sacraments acted as "an outward sign of an invisible inward happening" where the minister was the magical link between the congregation and God.: 26  Symbolism served as the means by which the link between the real and supernatural worlds were expressed. In this manner the following architectural forms symbolised or represented: the nave the Church Militant; the rood the Church Expectant; the chancel the Church Triumphant; three steps the Trinity; the octagonal form Eternity; the eagle for St John; the alb purity; and the stole as the priest's reminder of the yoke of his responsibilities.: 26  The Tractarians also incorporated the Gothic (or medieval) spirit into their movement. This involved both the incorporation of this spirit into theology, but also the interrelating of Gothic architecture with "historical Anglican thought and practice".: 30  Tractarianism was, overall, a divisive movement, as among its supporters it generated much excitement, but at the same time it brought about resolute and firm opposition among its, often Evangelical, opponents. The nature of the movement to look towards the medieval past for inspiration led its liberal critics to label it as retrogressive and its Evangelical opponents as pro-Roman Catholic and a threat to the Protestant Church. Indeed, several of the movement's leaders seceded to the Roman Catholic Church. There was some focus by this movement on colonial spheres where a lack of establishment allowed greater scope for change, particularly in contrast to the restrictive conditions in England. This was especially the case during the earlier phases of the movement when its ambitions were Empire wide in scope. The early nineteenth century was a period of expansion of the British Empire and in each new colony the Church of England was forced to establish itself. The Tractarians perceived this to be an excellent opportunity to create models of their new order to demonstrate to their British audience and acted to provide support for colonial bishops in terms of clergy, funds, and designs, just when they were most needed. In NSW the reduction of the Church of England to denominational status after the 1836 Church Act garnered the movement some sympathy among colonial clergy. It became established in the colonial church in the 1840s under the patronage of Bishop Broughton and invigorated the local church, but at the cost of more than a century of conflict within its circles. Generally, "High Churchmen", such as Bishop Broughton were persuaded by the Tractarian arguments, but the older, usually Evangelical, colonial clergy were opposed to and infuriated by it.: 24, 52 : 29 : 29–30  The Cambridge Camden Society, later the Ecclesiological Society, was originally established to study the design and execution of ecclesiastical ornaments and buildings. This organisation was closely allied with the Tractarian movement as their goal was to provide structural expression for the liturgical and doctrinal ideals they developed. They eventually settled on Gothic architecture as being the most fitting for church construction and promoted these designs in Britain and across her colonies. In accordance with their goals they had very stringent architectural standards and design requirements. The society advocated an architectural form known as "symbolic sacramentality" which was a system where the material fabric of the structure was designed to symbolise or embody some abstract meaning and through which an expression of liturgy could be articulated structurally. In essence the society aimed to develop a style that could best embody "both liturgical and architectural beauty without striving for effect". This society aimed to implement the reformations of the Tractarian Movement through igniting a change in ecclesiological architecture in England. The favoured design or icon of the society ultimately came to be an idealised version of the 14th Century English country parish church and particularly the designs modelled after this type by its favoured architects in the 1830s and 1840s. This design stressed the proper definition and separation of the nave and chancel; the allocation of the chancel with fair proportions; the placement of the font at the entrance to the church; the addition of an exterior porch; the provision of aisles with the subsequent threefold division of the nave symbolising the holy trinity; the provision of an un-galleried nave furnished with open benches; the establishment of the chancel, sanctuary, and altar as the focus of the congregation through their elevation with steps (ideally three each); the sub-division of the chancel into a chorus cantorum and sacrarium; and the alignment of the church so that it faced east. Church design should also encourage the exclusion of the congregation from the chancel. A tower was not considered an essential element, but if provided should be at the west end or at the crossing of the church if it featured transepts. The most ideal gothic style was the Decorated dating to between 1260–1360 (13th–14th Centuries) and building materials stone, or less so flints, with bricks only being used as an alternative when neither was available. In this manner, a church should emphasise auditory and hierarchal values in its architecture. This design was in contrast to the traditional early nineteenth century style that featured high box pews, triple-decker pulpit, and a western gallery containing harmonium and choir.: 25–28, 50–52, 145 : 105  The society's development during the 1830s–1850s coincided with an intense period of church building in England which was often rationalised as being a response to population growth associated with the Industrial Revolution. At this time the society was optimistically encouraging the building of churches and growth of the faith in anticipation and in response to population growth, as well as a means of re-converting much of the wayward rural population that were in need of redemption. As such, many of its members held a missionary zeal to spread the word of Tractarianism and develop a common faith across the Empire. This period lasted until the early 1860s (after 50 years of intense church building) when the emergence of a secular alternative eroded the power of the church and led to a decrease in church attendance and patronage.: 24, 28  In accordance with the interest of the Tractarian movement in Colonial spheres the Cambridge Camden Society also attempted to spread their influence in this direction. This took the form of dispersing acceptable drawings for a range of ecclesiological correct church designs, including most prominently those of the rural country parish church design, through clerical networks and their own publications to assist in educating and training colonial clergy and architects in ecclesiology. This was particularly achieved through colonial clergy gathering appropriate designs and information on their visits back to England. There was some attempt to provide suitable designs for different climates, but usually faithful English designs were favoured by local populations, despite their unsuitability in some cases.: 52–54 : 202–203  Ultimately Tractarianism and the Cambridge Camden Society brought about a gradual move towards a more sacramental form of worship and the introduction of a separate choir within the Church of England over the second half of the nineteenth century. This resulted in most churches across England being converted in accordance with the Cambridge Camden Society's requirements (through the construction of new churches or the restoration or remodelling of existing churches) and the substitution of music for speech in common doctrine in accordance with the shift from the word and the pulpit to the altar and the sacraments. Consequently, over this time Tractarianism gradually replaced Evangelicalism as the norm in the Church of England in Britain.: 121  In the colony Tractarianism, despite some crises, continued to develop under Bishop Broughton up until his death in 1853. The new Bishop of Australia was the Evangelical Bishop Barker and he encouraged the Anglican Colonial Church to move towards an Evangelical revival that generally preferred the Low Church approach to Anglican worship.: 31 : 187  Appendix 2: Richard Cromwell Carpenter (1812–1855) Richard Cromwell Carpenter throughout his career rose to become one of the most prominent ecclesiastical architects in England. He was strongly associated with the Gothic Revival Movement, Victorian High Church, and Cambridge Camden Society. Carpenter was born in Clerkenwell, London, in 1812 and educated at Charterhouse School. His professional career began in 1827–1828 when he was apprenticed to John Blyth and it was soon discovered that he had an inclination for ecclesiastical architecture. His architectural career began to take off in the 1830s with his first executed commissions being for secular projects. In 1840 he married Amelia Dollman (1821–1891) and together they had four children. Carpenter's career as an ecclesiastical architect blossomed during the 1840s. Between 1840 and 1841 he was introduced to the Cambridge Camden Society by A. W. N. Pugin, a leading architect of the Gothic Revival movement, and became a convert to the movement and soon one of the society's favoured architects. He was strongly associated with the "High Church" and the Cambridge Camden Society over his career with these connections providing a great many of his firm's commissions. Over his career he designed 28 churches, of which half were built, and several cathedrals, which all remained unexecuted. He also restored 36 churches, two cathedrals, and an abbey. Among his church designs were characteristic plans for town and rural churches that came to mark a "Carpenter" church. His "town" churches were usually substantial hall churches that were intended to be accompanied by a dominant spire. His "rural" churches were an idealised reproduction of a fourteenth century country parish church. They were small and simple and featured a separate chancel and nave and western bell cote, as well as an emphasis on mass in their design. They had the following characteristics: a dominant nave and chancel that featured a structurally evidenced division; aisles that were subsidiary spaces; a bell-cote to summon the laity to worship and which signified the consecration; nave and chancel featuring sharply pitched roofs and aisles with lean-to roofs and a lack of a clerestory; an elevated chancel and raised altar; buttresses serving structural and symbolic purposes; the use of local and honest building materials; and the overall style being first or second pointed.: 51–52  Towards the end of his career several of Carpenter's designs were included in the Cambridge Camden Society's second edition of the Instrumenta ecclesiastica, which was the premier design book of the society. This edition was published in 1856, a year after Carpenter's death from tuberculosis at the age of 42 at his home in London. At his death some members of the society considered Carpenter architectural skill to be superior to that of Pugin as he was "safer and more equable" and had an exquisite eye for colour. His success was deemed to lie in his ability to ensure the keeping of "the harmony of parts and general unity of proportion" within his designs.: 2, 20, 22, 45  The Church of the Holy Innocents is based on Carpenter's "rural" church design. In particular the design of St John the Baptist, Cookham Dean, Berkshire (1844–1845) which was exported to Australia and resulted in the design of the Church of the Holy Innocents and St John the Baptist, Buckland, Tasmania (1846–1848). Specifically, the followings aspects of the Church of the Holy Innocents are characteristic of this design: the steep roofs (unnecessary in the Australian climate), dominant bell cote and gable cross, symbolic buttresses, wooden porch, and geometric widows. In this manner, the Church of the Holy Innocents is strongly associated with this strand of Carpenter's ecclesiastical career and demonstrative of his notable designs and his connections with the Cambridge Camden Society and Tractarianism.: 59  Appendix 3: Edmund Thomas Blacket (1817–1883) Blacket is recognised as one of Australia's leading architects of the nineteenth century, especially in the field of ecclesiological architecture. He was an innovator in ecclesiological architecture from the 1840s through to the 1880s, who, over his long career, produced a large number of high quality churches. Blacket was born at St Margaret's Hill, Southwark, Surrey, England on 25 August 1817. His father was the merchant James Blacket and his mother was Margaret Harriet (nee Ralph). He was educated at Mill Hill Congregational College and then spent three years in the family trade business before deciding to pursue a different calling. Initially he found employment in his brother's mill in Yorkshire before joining the Stockton and Darlington Railway Company around 1837 as a surveyor and engineer. While working for this company he became a skilled draftsman and surveyor, which were skills that were to serve him admirably later in life. His success as an engineer prompted his father to reward him with the funds to undertake a year travelling England sketching and recording details of medieval architecture. Between 1838 and 1841 he undertook many similar smaller journeys during which he produced many picturesque sketches of medieval architecture. After leaving Yorkshire in 1841 Blacket spent a year in London employed in inspecting schools for the Archbishop of Canterbury.: 8, 13  Blacket married Sarah Mease (1818–1869) on 21 May 1842 at Holy Trinity Church, Wakefield, Yorkshire, after overcoming considerable opposition to the match amongst both families. His father's reluctant approval allegedly required that Blacket leave the country, but it is also possible that the new couple sought the opportunities of the new Australian colony for their own purposes. Soon after they married, Edmund and Sarah sailed to Sydney, arriving on 3 November 1842. Blacket is thought to have carried letters of introduction to Bishop Broughton and Charles Nicholson, which allowed him to be appointed valuator to Bourke ward, Sydney and, most importantly, the inspector of the Church of England schools in the colony at the start of 1843. This position required that he design and supervise the construction of many school buildings, parsonages, and churches, and he was allowed to establish a private practice in May 1843. This role allowed him to present his architectural skills to Bishop Broughton who at the time was undertaking a rigorous campaign of church building and required someone with good architectural skills to assist him. Therefore, Blacket was soon able to establish a modest architectural practice and become known colloquially as the "Church Architect". Over the following years, he won respect for his sound work on a number of commissions and demonstrated his outstanding knowledge of Gothic styles through the construction of a number of new churches, as well as the redesign and completion of a number of unfinished cathedrals. This led him to be officially appointed Diocese architect by Bishop Broughton in 1847.: 8–9  On 1 December 1849 Blacket was appointed Colonial Architect, replacing Mortimer Lewis, and he remained in this position until September 1854. During this time he remained Diocese architect and continued to oversee work on a number of cathedrals and churches he has begun previously to this appointment. However, generally, this period was a time of stagnation in the colony's building industry due to the gold rushes that drew away the local workforce. On 30 September 1854 Blacket became The University of Sydney official architect, while retaining the right of private practice, and he subsequently designed many of its original buildings. From this time his reputation spread and grew throughout the colony and his architectural practice thrived accepting commissions on schools, colleges, banks, hospitals, commercial buildings, domestic buildings, and numerous Anglican churches. This diversity of work allowed him to be more creative architecturally and further develop the Gothic style in his ecclesiological work, while also experimenting with the Italianate style for commercial buildings.: 10–11  Sarah Blacket died in 1869 leaving Edmund with four sons and four daughters to raise and provide for. Three of his sons, Cyril (1858–1937), Arthur, and Owen, spent time in Blacket's practice. Cyril had joined the practice in 1872 and afterwards spent time travelling Britain, Western Europe, and North America, before returning in 1880 and becoming a partner. This caused the firm to become Blacket & Son. Edmund passed away only a few years later, on 9 February 1883, at his home in Petersham. Blacket was a stout and steadfast Anglican known for his good public character. He was respected and admired across the colony for his honesty, diligence, accuracy, fortitude, and propriety. Through his architectural career he scattered the colony with many handsome gothic churches and fulfilled one of his life's great ambitions.: 10–11  Blacket was a self-taught architect and dedicated adherent of the "archaeological" or correct school of Gothic architecture and was in this way not a Tractarian, but an Anglican of the Established Church. Archaeological gothic was the Early Victorian fashion, as publicised by the Camden Cambridge Society, and required strict adherence to and understanding of medieval gothic styles. As an archaeological gothicist Blacket's goal when building new churches was to create replicas of English medieval parish churches. To accomplish this during the early portion of his career (up to around 1860) Blacket operated by basing his designs on existing English churches (usual contemporary Gothic Revival churches) and then incorporating published medieval details available in copy or pattern books, magazines, newspapers, or his own note books. This was the approach any colonial architect had to use when designing a gothic building in Australia. While operating in this manner Blacket created some beautiful and imposing churches and he was particularly well known for his meticulous detailing and how he exploited good craftsmanship to reveal the intrinsic qualities of building materials. Blacket had a deep knowledge of gothic architecture and he continued to keep abreast of developments in the Gothic Revival movement and this allowed him to consistently, knowledgably, and effectively piece together the stylistic motifs of his churches.: 30  During the early stage of his colonial career Blacket's ecclesiological work was dominated by Bishop Broughton and his amateur architectural desires and motivations for the colonial church based on his High Church ideals and support for the Cambridge Camden Society and Tractarian movement. Broughton's connections in England (and his trips back there) allowed him to keep abreast of ecclesiological advances which influenced his designs for ecclesiological architecture in the colony. Blacket's youth, inexperience, and social obligations required that he submit to Broughton's architectural designs and the requests of other clerics and influential laymen that he design exact replicas of notable English village churches. Consequently, between 1843 and 1845 Blacket was merely involved in drawing up designs developed or provided by Bishop Broughton and ensuring that they were faithfully and competently built. The trend for English replicas in ecclesiological architecture continued through the 1840s and 1850s due to the English and Anglican backgrounds of Blacket's clients. This was in order to recall the glories of medieval England, as well as demonstrate the manner of proper Anglican worship. In time Blacket became the leading colonial architect specialising in catering to this Anglomania.: 9, 13 : 17  The 1840s was Blacket's time of major experimentation. It is possible to view his early ecclesiological works as experiments with the wide range of forms and styles permitted within the strict English tradition and precepts of the Gothic Revival. This was despite the fact that the majority of the churches he designed during this period were replicas of English designs. These churches and cathedrals were created by following specific designs sent from England or available in magazines, newspapers, and pattern books. This was in accordance with the dictates of the premier Camden Cambridge Society architects, such as Pugin, who encourage the following of English tradition in church design and not personal originality. Overall, Blacket's work during this period allowed him to develop a series of prototypes for specific styles he would consistently use throughout his career.: 13  After Blacket became Diocese architect in 1847 and Colonial Architect in 1849 he grew in confidence and assurance and began to be more resolute with relation to his design choices for new buildings, allowing him to express his own voice. His time as colonial architect did not produce many public buildings, but it was successful in terms of routine maintenance and administration. Bishop Broughton died in 1853 and his successor Bishop Frederic Barker abhorred Tractarians and ecclesiologists and had no interest in architecture which gave Blacket free rein on further church designs. However, he still heavily favoured Gothic designs over the rest of his career according to his conviction that Early English styles were proper for small churches and Perpendicular styles for collegiate buildings. During the 1850s and 1860s Blacket moved beyond imitation utilising his experience from the 1840s to create his own vision of the English medieval parish church based on his own repertoire of designs and building details. This resulted in him refining a type of small stone rural church that was to be reproduced a large number of times across different areas of the colony throughout the remainder of this career. These churches were based on the medieval English ideal and featured "separately-roofed parts, little bellcotes, gabled roofs, and pointed windows" and Blacket's variant was perfect for the predominately rural NSW colony. This became the archetypal Victorian Church of NSW and it was continually requested by Blacket's clients. The 1860s also became the era of the Blacket town church which became archetypal among Anglicans throughout the rest of Blacket's Career. By this time, as ecclesiological architecture moved away from Pugin's strict emulative medievalism, more innovative and original Gothic Revival churches were beginning to be produced in the High Victorian style. Blacket kept up with this architectural trend throughout the late 1860s and 1870s actively bringing in the High Victorian style into his ecclesiological work. Unfortunately, Blacket's later churches are less inventive or varied than his early ones as once he became the dominant authority on ecclesiological architecture in the colony he tended to safely reproduce churches of particular styles based on the design repertoire he developed in his youth.: 13 : 21  In conclusion, Kerr (1983:13) has characterised Blacket's architectural career as containing three periods: the 1840s experimental period which created the most important churches for the development of church architecture in the colony of the time; the 1850s–1860s period of individual expression and development of a repertoire of designs for specific building types and features which resulted in the construction of his most loved churches; and the late 1860s to early 1880s experimentation with High Victorian Gothic styles which created his major ecclesiological works.  Description This item comprises the Church of the Holy Innocents (and its original furnishings), its associated cemetery and churchyard, and the archaeological site of the original slab timber school/church hall. These features are situated on four lots which were granted to the Church of England in 1848 under the 1836 Church Act. They are nonsequentially arranged from north to south as 1, 4, 2, and 3.  Archaeological site of the original school/church hall The original slab timber school/church hall was constructed in 1827 by the Clergy and School Lands Corporation. It was located in the southeast corner of the original 1825 Church Reserve and is thought to have been a simple, cheap, multipurpose building like others constructed by the corporation.: 73  According to oral tradition it was destroyed by a bushfire in 1931 after it had been replaced by a new Church Hall in c. 1886. Its archaeological remains are potentially extant within the churchyard in the southeast corner of the current Lot 4. This area comprises an indistinct flat platform area adjacent to two pepper trees. Unfortunately, no archaeological features or artefacts are evident besides this platform. However, this site could feasibly contain archaeological resources such as foundation remains and preserved construction materials including post-holes, hearths, or wall-base slots. Other occupational deposits, such as underfloor layers or rubbish pits, may also be present within, and surrounding, the site.  Cemetery The cemetery was originally contained within the western half of the original church reserve (the present Lot 4) to the rear of the original school/church yard. The first known burial in the cemetery was conducted in 1829 and it continued to be used throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A few burials are present from the twenty-first century, with the most recent being from 2007. The cemetery continues in use today and is mostly confined to Lot 4, but intrudes slightly into Lot 2. Due to how the cemetery was originally located at the rear of the original church reserve, burials have spread from the rear fence of the churchyard towards the Church Street frontage over time. After the construction of the Church of the Holy Innocents in 1848–1850 this involved the burials spreading along its south side in the area that provided access to the church (via the porch). Some burials are located directly behind the church, and a few are present on its north side (where the vestry entrance is located). As such, the oldest burials in the cemetery, which comprise a typical variety of Georgian and Early Victorian graves and monuments, with some featuring fine detailing, are located in the rear section. This section includes graves for a number of members of the original pioneer families of the local area such as the Bells from nearby Bellfield Farm. Burials from the early twentieth century are located closer to the west side of the church and around the current path from the church porch to the parking area. The most recent burials are located on the east side of the cemetery. In all, the cemetery comprises approximately 100 extant graves or memorials. Those with visible inscriptions date from the 1840s through to the recent past. However, there are several sandstone graves that are now too eroded for their inscriptions to be made out. Around a dozen headstones have also fallen over and become disassociated with their original graves. Some of these are lying across the cemetery and others have been rested up against the north side of the church. The remaining graves and headstones range in condition from poor to good with subsidence being a major issue. A fair number of headstones are listing to one side and are in danger of collapsing. However, there are plans in 2017 for conservation works by the Diocese of Sydney to stabilise these headstones. Remarkably the cemetery has suffered little to no vandalism likely due to its semi-rural location. According to available historical records there must be a fair number of unmarked graves in the cemetery, particularly those dating to the earliest periods of use (late 1820s–1840s). An unusual hardwood engraved gravestone is preserved in the vestry that possibly belongs to John McKaughan and dates to 1848. It is unknown where this gravestone was originally located. As of a site inspection on the 28 November 2016 the cemetery has recently been subjected to good gardening maintenance following the acquisition of the property by the Diocese of Sydney. This has resulted in the removal of much of the previous vegetation overgrowth at the rear of the cemetery and the general cleaning-up of the whole area.  Churchyard The churchyard is confined mostly within Lot 4 (but perhaps partially within Lot 2) and is generally well kept and features scattered various tree plantings, but mostly eucalyptus. However, due to a lack of fencing around this feature it blends into the undeveloped Lot 1 to the north and the carpark and modern buildings to the south in Lots 2 and 3. As such, today the Churchyard is to some degree indistinct and difficult to demarcate, where in the past it featured fences to separate it from the surrounding lots. The church property only features a complete fence along its west and south boundaries: on the west side this consists of a modern wire fence and on the south side a modern corrugated metal fence. However, there are elements of an older fence along the east boundary which is evident as a long low mound. Other extant fence elements include corner posts at the north and south ends and four matching posts and a surviving panel of a white picket fence in poor condition around the driveway entrance to the churchyard. These large hardwood posts have decorative "onion dome" carved tops and their associated picket fence features turned timber pickets. Square wooden posts from a former picket gate are also located at the rear of the cemetery along the west boundary of the property where a former grass pathway from the church porch to the rear of the property was located. A modern driveway leads from the front gate of the churchyard to the south side of the church. A few remnant pine and cypress trees from former more extensive plantings along this feature are extant along its length. Another paved path leads from the church porch to the dirt carpark on Lot 2 adjacent the new Church Hall. It bisects the early 20th Century section of the cemetery. One or two pine trees from former extensive plantings along the Church Street frontage are also extant. The southern Lots 2 and 3 contain the dirt carpark, brick rectory (1987), and stone and brick church hall (1980s). The rectory is currently leased out to tenants and the Church Hall is leased to the local Baptist Church for services and other community uses. The brick rectory, stone and brick church hall, and dirt carpark do not add to the significance of the place and are considered to be non-contributory features. The northern Lot 1 is undeveloped and is covered in a small stand of immature eucalyptus trees (dating to after the 1940s). Recently the grass beneath them has been mowed back and cleaned up removing any high grass or low bushes. This lot is considered to add to the significant setting of the church and is a contributory feature.  The Church of the Holy Innocents The following is summarised from the 1989 Conservation Study by Noel Bell, Ridley Scott & Partners except where otherwise noted. It includes comparisons of the Church of the Holy Innocents with the available historical drawings of Carpenter's design for the Church of St John the Baptist, Cookham Dean that illustrate how Blacket reinterpreted and amended this design adding his own distinct flavour to the church.  Exterior The Church of the Holy Innocents is a small rural church with a two-bay nave, a disproportionally large chancel/sanctuary, a north vestry, a south open timber porch, and a simple brick bell-cote at the western end of its steep shingled gabled roof. It is orientated in the traditional manner, east-west, with the sanctuary at the east end. The layout of the church is of the English type (rather than the antipodean) with the porch on the south side of the nave, the vestry on the north side of the chancel, and the pulpit in the northeast corner of the nave. Usually in Australia these features are on the opposite sides.: 204–205 : 59  The church is founded on clay or slate and is built on brick foundations. It features a sandstone plinth course with a chamfered weather which projects out from the walls. Above this is a slate damp proof course. The church walls are constructed of fine-quality red-blue mottle sandstock bricks within a soft lime mortar in English bond face brickwork. They are reinforced with engaged brick buttresses placed at all the corner returns and along the wall length at regular intervals. At sill height along the nave walls and the east wall of the chancel is a continuous projecting sandstone string course. The entire church also features sandstone tracery and trimmings on the doors, windows, and buttress caps. The brickwork at the top of the walling is corbelled out to form the eaves detail and support the thrust of the roof framing. Overall, the buttress and string courses of stone trim break the wall at regular intervals and create a pleasing contrast . The bricks used in the church construction are of a very regular gauge (230 x 65mm) showing that they are of good quality. The sandstone dressings on the building have been tooled to a very high standard, but the very fine grained sandstone if of an inferior quality. It was quarried locally at Cobbitty. The use of brick, highlighted with sandstone, to construct the church is illustrative of Blacket's adaption of the Cookham Dean design (which was built in stone) to suit local conditions. All six church windows are of a gothic style and feature elaborate stone tracery. The four nave windows and the single example in the vestry all have two lights and simple quatrefoil tracery in the heads. The large east chancel or sanctuary window is far more detailed with three lights and a very elaborate tracery panel (varied quatrefoil) and features a brightly coloured geometric glass design. This glass design was funded by the women of the parish in 1850. Research by Robin Hedditch suggests that the stained glass east window was likely locally made by a glazier using a restricted palette of coloured stained glass. These types of windows are characterised by the use of plain, unpainted coloured (stained glass), a restricted colour palette, and simple geometric patterns favouring straight lines. During this period it was costly to import stained glass windows from Britain and there were no trained stained glass artists in the colony until the early 1840s. Consequently, many churches built during this time conquered this situation by employing a local glazier (lead and plumbing tradesmen) to make a "stained glass" window using local materials. These materials consisted of sheets of imported stained glass in a limited range of colours (generally crimson, purple, green, blue, yellow, and amber) that the glazier would cut into simple, non-figurative, geometric designs. This naive style was shortlived as by the 1850s the goldrushes brought wealth to the colony and the ability to commission windows from Britain or from newly arrived British trained stained glass artists. This research is ongoing and when completed could prove that this style of stained glass windows represents a rare, local response to the fashionable Gothic Revival movement by non-trained glass artists using locally available materials. This could mean that the east window is one of the earliest known surviving examples of "stained glass" in Australia while also being a rare example of naive 1840s locally-made stained glass windows. The east window is also likely an excellent example of this naive style as the local glazier when to great lengths to create a suitably rich, gothic design with the limited means available. The glazier was also largely successful in devising simple lead lines to showcase the rich, but limited, colour range of available stained glass. The design also appears to be attempting to emulate the highly prized "mosaic" effect that was a hallmark of Gothic Revival windows combined with a Victorian love of "crazy" design. The glazier's skills is also apparent in the use of clear glass in the background to highlight the bright colours and the repeating geometric pattern. This creates an effect of restless colour within a strong vertical repeating framework that is impressive within the church given its size and the east window being its main decorative object (submission provided by Robin Hedditch). Another element of the church design elaborated by Blacket is the well-shaped hood moulds terminating in an uncarved label stop which each window features. This is a common Blacket detail that was designed to allow the carving of bosses or decorative features in the future. Blacket's reinterpretation of the design is also evident in the internal form of the windows as each features chamfered stone reveals that follow the external gothic pointed arch. In contrast, the windows on Carpenter's drawings have revealing arches. All the church windows feature wire mesh security fittings on the exterior. One of the north windows in the nave and the vestry window have been modified and fitted with a small rectangular hinged section to allow air flow into the building. The church features three doors: two external and one internal. All are constructed of solid cedar (60mm thick) and are ledged and hung internally and close boarded externally and retain their original Gothic style hardware. The external arched porch entry door is of a double door type, and hung on hard forged decorative "gothic" strap hinges and features catches and a rim lock. It originally was grained in imitation of oak but is now painted. The single type external vestry door is of a similar design but is square headed. Due to its greater exposure to the elements this door is showing signs of weathering and is deteriorating. It appears to have had one panel replaced in the recent past in an unsympathetic manner. The single type interior arched vestry door is similar to the other doors, but its external face is different with it featuring alternating higher and lower panels (a ribbed design). Each of the gabled roofs of the church (nave, chancel, vestry, and porch) are pitched at 60 degrees in order to give perfect balance to the proportion of the wall below. The nave roof is the highest indicating its importance as the home of the congregation. Each of the three other roofs break down far below the line of the nave roof indicating their subordinate function. The roofs were originally covered in hardwood shingles, but those on the nave were replaced in the 1940s with asbestos shingles. The nave roof is capped with a rolled ridge capping and features a fine stone capped bell cote at its western end. The east end of the Nave roof originally featured a stone cross that was removed sometime after the 1970s.: 204  In contrast to Cookham Dean this bellcote is provided with added emphasis by being separated from the main wall plane by the gable verge. This change is further evidence of the refinement of the design by Blacket as he commonly used this design feature on smaller churches throughout his career. Otherwise the bell cote is in keeping with the Carpenter "Rural" church design of the church. The bell cote was restored in 1991 as part of works on the west facade. The hardwood (cedar) shingles covering the chancel, vestry, and porch roofs were removed during restoration work between 1991 and 1993 and replaced with hardwood "she oak" shakes. Unfortunately, this replacement lining on these roofs has now become weathered and is deteriorating. However, there are plans by the Diocese of Sydney to undertake conservation works in the near future. The chancel roof appears to be in good condition except for its guttering on the north side which has become dislodged at the east end and is caught on the vestry roof. The timber framed open porch is finely detailed and features a sharply pitched timber shingled roof and stone flagging. It leads straight into the southern entry of the nave. While today this feature is open its lower panels were originally filled in with cedar planking to make this structure half-open. It was completely restored in 1992–1993 which involved it being dismantled and rebuilt with any deteriorating elements being replaced with appropriate replacements. This restoration process also involved re-levelling and re-aligning the porch with the chancel entrance. This porch is different from the Carpenter drawings and marks another refinement or amendment of the design by Blacket. It is markedly different in terms of proportion (being far larger in relation to the church proportionally than its Cookham Dean counterpart) and is far less elaborate as it lacks the carvings and cusping of Cookham Dean. Comparatively this feature of the church is likely unique for this period (late 1840s) in NSW/Australia.  Internal The church interior is generally plain or restrained in detail and economical in style, but is well proportioned and fitted out. Originally, the internal walls were lime washed and the stone window reveals bare, but both these surfaces have been painted in the recent past. The interior walls of the nave have also been rendered to create a dado to counteract rising damp. The exposed, stained, hammer beam truss roof ceiling and the dark Australian red cedar interior furnishings provide a pleasing contrast to the otherwise white interior of the church. This interior design of the church would have almost wholly been the responsibility of Blacket as the Cookham Dean drawings to not provide any details or instructions on how the church interior was fitted out. The entire interior space of the church is floored with sandstone flagging. On top of this in the nave are two banks of open timber seating on raised timber platforms. Open pews on raised timber boxes such as these are common in Blacket churches and are evident of his addition to Carpenter's design. This design also results in the centre of the nave featuring a narrow stone flagged aisle leading to the chancel. On the north and south sides of the nave exterior small modern ventilation holes have been created to air the space beneath these timber platforms. At the rear of the nave in the southwest corner is a large sandstone font designed in a fourteenth century style by Blacket directly adjacent the interior entrance from the porch. This beautifully carved feature has in the past been considered to be over elaborate when compared to the general plain and economical nature of the church interior. A simple Australian red cedar pulpit is located in the northeast corner on a raised sandstone platform and is accessed by possibly concrete steps (these may be a modern addition). The pulpit has been lowered sometime in the recent past by around 50 cm as indicated by marking on the surrounding walls. The nave contains several memorials fitted on to its walls including: An honour roll inscribed with the names of 23 men from the district who served in both World Wars (north wall). A marble plaque sacred to the memory of Lieutenant William Brown who fell at Mouguet, France, on 3 September 1916 (north wall). A marble plaque sacred to the memory of Henry Robert Lowe, born 2 November 1831 – died 19 October 1880, of "Briling" Farm (east wall); and A marble plaque scared to the memory of Laura Lowe, born 1830 – died 9 July 1902 (south wall). The chancel is separated from the nave by a brick chancel arch. This section of the church is narrower than the nave and two steps higher. The sanctuary is separated from the chancel by another step and a low cedar communion rail (sacred to the memory of Mr and Mrs A. V. McCann – 1962). Within the sanctuary there is a decorative carved stone sedilia on its southern wall and decorative plaster dados on the walls. During the site inspection on 28 November 2016 a small range of furniture was arranged throughout the chancel and sanctuary, including four chairs, an alms box, a pray kneeler, and a rectangular timber altar along the east wall of the sanctuary, beneath the window. Generally the existing furniture, with the exception of the modern communion table, is similar to that described in Munro's accounts suggesting that they are original. In 1989 the original communion table was known to survive, but its location was not mentioned. As of 1989 the original High Victorian Gothic design communion set survived and was still in use. They comprised a solid silver Chalice and Pattern housed in a wooden carry case and were of English manufacture and possibly of an A. W. G. Pugin design. Within the chancel are also two small brass vases and a brass cross that lack any subscriptions and a book of common prayer scared to the memory of Charles Henry Thorsby. The alms dish, bible, and prayer book in the church are all thought to be original furnishings. The vestry opens off the north side of the chancel and during the site inspection (28 November 2016) was used partially as storage. It is decorated in the same manner as the nave and chancel, but its sandstone flagging appears to be subsiding in the northwest corner and the walls in the southwest corner have been water damaged from a leak in the roof. The church ceiling consists of a simplified hammer beam roof with close butted boarding and an arched brace and collar tie. This design is considered to be extremely fine and is evidently more elaborate than Carpenter's drawings indicating that it is another refinement of this design by Blacket.  Condition As at 10 July 2017, The Church of the Holy Innocents retains most of its original fabric and has not been modified in an extensive manner. However, poor maintenance during the recent past has resulted in the deterioration of some of the wooden elements of the structure, such as the porch, chapel, and vestry roofs, and external vestry door. This has in turn resulted in some water and pest damage to the church interior, particularly along the south wall of the chancel and the southwest corner of the vestry. However, recent efforts by the Diocese of Sydney at improving maintenance of the church has enhanced its condition and there are plans to conduct restoration works on the church and its grounds in the near future. The Church of the Holy Innocents has good integrity and intactness as the majority of its original fabric is extant. The churchyard has fair integrity and intactness as it retains most of its original fabric, but is in need of maintenance works. The churchyard has only poor integrity and intactness as its boundary fence has been removed, although it still exists as an open space.  Modifications and dates The Church of the Holy Innocents features no major modifications – it is still largely original in form – although there have been some small alterations to different aspects of the building (i.e., removal of the stone cross on the nave roof, lowering of the pulpit, replacement of the original cedar shingles on the nave roof with asbestos shingles, etc.). Previously, there have been three renovation projects undertaken to restore the church: one in the late 1940s, one in the 1960s, and the other in the early 1990s. In 1946, prior to the celebrations for the centenary of the church, a refurbishment project was undertaken. This involved restoring the roof, repairing the stone flagging, and re-varnishing the ceiling The third phase of restoration works proceeded from the conservation study undertaken in 1989. It had identified several elements of the building that required urgent attention, and consequently, between 1990 and 1993, work was undertaken to:  Replace damaged stonework on the bell turret; Repair or replace damaged flashing; Repair or replace damaged eaves material; Repair the pointing to damaged brickwork to a high level; Level the font to avoid further damage or collapse; and Relay uneven stone flagging and remove cement pointing. These works were undertaken with the assistance of a financial grant from the Heritage Council (Heritage Assistance Program) and were conducted in a sympathetic manner. Until recently, this item existed in an open rural setting, but the surrounding landscape has been progressively becoming semi-rural over the past few decades as development has extended along Bringelly Road associated with the proposed second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek.  Heritage listing As at 28 July 2017, The Church of the Holy Innocents, churchyard, and cemetery is of state heritage significance because of its historical, associative, technical, aesthetic, research, rarity, and representative values. The church is the result of an unusual partnership of two prominent ecclesiastical architects: Richard Cromwell Carpenter, one of the leading English architects of the Cambridge Camden Society, and Edmund Blacket, the most prominent Australian ecclesiastical architect of the nineteenth century. It is the only church in NSW based on a design by Richard Cromwell Carpenter and only one of three in Australia. This church is one of the earliest Gothic Revival churches in NSW recognised as being correct in its medieval detail and thus, an important, rare and representative example of this new wave of church architecture. Its highly detailed, Gothic Revival design renders it remarkable in a state context as a small rural church. The church is also designed according to the principles of the Tractarian Movement, facilitating a change in liturgical emphasis from the pulpit and the spoken word, to the altar and the sacraments associated with a separate choir. The application of a Tractarian design in this small rural church embodies wider debates within the Church of England under Bishop Broughton. The church is also strongly associated with the main group of proponents of the Gothic Revival and Tractarian Movements operating in, or in association with, the Church of England during the 1840s in NSW: Bishop Broughton, Edmund Blacket, Reverend Horatio Walsh, and Reverend George Vidal. The church, churchyard, cemetery, and archaeological site are associated with several important pieces of legislation relating to the governance and position of religion, and specifically the Church of England, in colonial society during the early nineteenth century. As such, these original features and the church land is able to tell a story about the changing nature of religion and the position of the Church of England in the early colony. The retention of the semi-rural nature of the church, churchyard, and cemetery into the twenty-first century also demonstrates the historic rural landscape and isolation that made the finely designed Gothic Revival Church of the Holy Innocents a remarkable and rare place of worship. Church of the Holy Innocents was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 August 2018 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Church of the Holy Innocents is of State historical significance due to its Tractarian design that forms an important early example of this type of architecture in NSW. Bishop Broughton's decision to use the English Tractarian design of Richard Cromwell Carpenter illustrates the progressive changes in the Church of England during this period associated with the Tractarian Movement and Cambridge Camden Society, which controversially promoted a change in liturgical emphasis from the pulpit and the spoken word to the altar and the sacraments associated with a separate choir. Through its design, this church reflects contemporary debates within the Church of England under Bishop Broughton. The Church of the Holy Innocents is an important early example of the Colonial Church's participation in the Gothic Revival movement, which was Empire wide in scope. The Gothic Revival movement, under the influence of Edmund Blacket, was to dominate ecclesiastical architecture in the colony for the majority of the nineteenth century. This item is of State historical significance as the site and its development materially demonstrate a range of early nineteenth century legislation related to church building, religious development, and the provision of education within the colony of NSW. The original small reserve for the church, cemetery, and school within the Cabramatta village reserve from 1825 is linked to the restructuring of the colonial surveying system carried out by Governor Brisbane. The archaeological remains of the slab timber church/school hall and the early portion of the cemetery are linked to the Clergy and School Lands Corporation (1826–1833), and the Church of the Holy Innocents and the land from the second land grant are linked to the 1836 Church Act. In this manner, the item illustrates the attempts by Colonial authorities during this period to develop and improve the colony's moral condition through the establishment of strong religious institutions that had a widespread presence throughout society. It also demonstrates the slow loss of pre-eminence of the Church of England in the colony during this period. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Church of the Holy Innocents and its stone font potentially have a strong historical association of State significance with Edmund Thomas Blacket (1817–1883), a prominent ecclesiastical architect renowned for his contributions to the Gothic Revival movement. As Diocesan Architect, Blacket adapted and executed Richard Cromwell Carpenter's design for the Church of the Holy Innocents, and he oversaw its construction as Diocese and then Colonial Architect. While it is still recognisably a rural "Carpenter" church, Blacket's elaboration of Carpenter's design is clearly apparent. This church belongs to the experimental period of Blacket's career when he was still developing his design repertoire and confidence in Gothic Revival architecture. It could be considered to be one of his early successes in Gothic Revival architecture as it has been described as "perfect a mediaeval replica as was ever realised in the colony". Blacket also designed the church's stone font, as well as potentially all the internal fittings and furniture. This item is one of the finest small rural churches Blacket built over his long career. The church is also strongly associated with the main group of proponents of the Gothic Revival and Tractarian Movements operating in, or in association with, the Church of England during the 1840s in NSW. This group included Bishop Broughton, the main promoter of the Gothic Revival; the Reverend Horatio Walsh a leading Tractarian in the Colonial church; Edmund Blacket, the leading architect of the Gothic Revival; and the Reverend George Vidal, the first minister of the church and a well-known Tractarian and promoter of the Gothic Revival. These clergy and architects encouraged the use of Carpenter's design for this church and oversaw its successful completion as part of a wider effort of promoting these two movements within the Church of England. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Church of the Holy Innocents is of technical significance at a state level due to its Tractarian design which was cutting edge at the time. This design was approved by the Cambridge Camden Society, and prepared by one of their favoured architects, Richard Cromwell Carpenter. While many of the other churches Blacket designed early in his career were based on English designs in the same manner, they do not have the architectural precedents of the Church of the Holy Innocents, which is recognisably a "Carpenter" church embodying the principles of the Tractarian Movement. Thus, it is archetypal of the early stages in NSW of the Empire-wide Gothic Revival movement that was to dominate ecclesiastical architecture in the colony for the next several decades. Its architecture and its high level of detailing for a small rural church renders it exceptional within the state context – the vast majority of small churches were built to vernacular designs with much less exacting attention to construction. Historically the Church of the Holy Innocents was also exceptional aesthetically for its rural location and picturesque backdrop that finely expressed its isolation, and made this a remarkable and rare place of worship. Over recent decades this rural landscape has been gradually developed to the stage that it is now semi-rural in nature, but the historic rural and isolated nature of this place is still appreciable at the site through the undeveloped lot to the north. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As the only church associated with Richard Cromwell Carpenter within NSW, and only one of three in Australia, the Church of the Holy Innocents has great research potential within the context of Gothic Revival architecture, and the state's ecclesiastical architecture in general. It can also contribute positively to the study of the Tractarian Movement and High Church within the Church of England in the colony during the early nineteenth century. The archaeological site of the slab timber school/church hall potentially has good research potential due to its connection with the Clergy and School Lands Corporation. The corporation primarily built plain, cheap, and multi-purpose school/church buildings during its existence between 1826 and 1833 and reportedly only one of these is extant. This archaeological site potentially provides an important resource to investigate the simple wooden buildings erected during this program through any foundation remains or construction materials preserved at the site (post-holes, hearths, wall base slots, etc.). Through other occupational deposits (underfloor layers or rubbish pits) it also has the potential to provide information on activities undertaken within the structure throughout its lifetime. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Church of the Holy Innocents is rare in NSW as an early small scale rural Gothic Revival church and a small rural church of a Tractarian design. It is also rare in the context of NSW ecclesiastical architecture as being the only church in NSW, and one of three in Australia, based on a design by Richard Cromwell Carpenter. This design had been purposefully imported to the Colony by the adherents of the Tractarian movement to stimulate the construction of ecclesiastically correct churches in the Australian context. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Church of the Holy Innocents is representative in the state context as a small rural church of Gothic Revival design of good integrity and intactness. It is representative of a well-designed and executed small rural church, innovative in its application of Tractarian design principles. Most other small rural churches of this period were of vernacular design. Its design is also representative of the early stages of the Gothic Revival and Tractarian Movements in the Church of England in the colony during the 1840s and the expression of the values and goals of these movements in the context of a small rural church.

The 362nd Signal Company ("Deuces Wild") is a military communications company of the United States Army subordinate to the 41st Signal Battalion, 1st Signal Brigade and located at Seoul Air Base in South Korea.  Vietnam War The 362nd Signal Company was deployed in Vietnam from 23 March 1962, to 15 March 1973, as part of the 39th Signal Battalion. The 362nd was deployed from the Delta to the DMZ, providing long range Tropo-Scatter radio telephone communications throughout South Vietnam, with one site in Udorn Air Force Base in Thailand.  In early 1964, the site in Ubon was no longer part of the 362nd Signal.  By mid 1964, the 362nd operated Microwave Communications sites in Soc Trang, Vinh Long, Phulam (near Saigon), Nha Trang, Quinhon, Danang, Hue, Quang Ngai, Pleiku, Ban Me Thuot and Gia Nghia.  In July, 1964, the 362n Signal Company had 216 Enlisted Men and 12 Officers.  Operation Back Porch was the use of AN/MRC-85 Troposphere Scatter Microwave Communications Systems linking Saigon, Nha Trang, Quinhon and Danang, and linking Nha Trang to Pleiku and Ubon.  The 362nd Signal also operated TRC-90 Microwave links joining Soc Trang to Vinh Long and Phulan, linking Phu Lam with Gia Nghia, Ban Me Thuot and Pleiku, linking Danang with Hue, Chu Lai and Quang Ngai.  The 362nd Signal was just about the first in and the last out of regular US Army company sized units deployed to South Vietnam.  The final mission was turning over the communications sites to the International Control Commission following the signing of the Paris Peace Agreement.  The motto during that period was "Hang Loose With the Deuce." During my period of service in Vietnam with the 362nd Signal Company, June 1967 to June 1968, we were under the 73rd Signal Battalion.  South Korea to the modern day On 1 July 1974 the company was activated in the Republic of Korea under the 1st Signal Brigade. The company's mission in South Korea is to Install, Operate, Maintain, Protect and Restore Joint and Combined Theater Strategic Command and Control Communications Systems in Support of United Nations Command (UNC), Combined Forces Command (CFC), United States Forces Command-Korea (USFK), Eighth United States Army, and their subordinate commands, in order to defend the Republic of Korea, to deter enemy aggression and, if necessary, to defeat enemy forces in the event of war.

Clara Muhammad (born Clara Evans; also known as Clara Poole; November 2, 1899 – August 12, 1972) was born in Macon, Georgia, the daughter of Mary Lou (Thomas) and Quartus Evans. She was the wife of Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad. They married in Georgia in 1917, when she was 20 and he was 22 years old, before he changed his name from Elijah Poole. Between 1917 and 1939, Elijah and Clara Muhammad had eight children: six boys and two girls, including Warith Deen Muhammad. Known as the First Lady of the Nation of Islam, Muhammad is credited with introducing her husband to the teachings of Nation of Islam founder W.D. Fard, whom they met after leaving Cordele, Georgia. They had to relocate to Detroit because of the financial hardship caused by prejudice and low earnings. Despite moving to Detroit, Clara suffered with her marriage, since Elijah was an alcoholic and a gambling addict. This worsened the family’s financial predicament. However, their lives changed dramatically once they met W.D. Fard.  Clara Muhammad started attending W.D. Fard’s lectures, where he introduced his interpretation of Islam to African Americans during the Great Depression, attracting followers by promising a way out of racial misery and suffering. Through Clara’s interest in his lectures, she became the reason that her husband Elijah became the minister in the Allah Temple of Islam (ATOI). Sister Clara Muhammad played a crucial role in supporting her husband’s ministry. She was akin to the “preacher’s wife” in Christian churches, fulfilling various duties such as playing the piano during services, teaching Sunday school, and accompanying her husband during his trips. She guided the organization during her husband's absence from 1935 to 1946 as he fled death threats from rival temple leaders and was then incarcerated for sedition during World War II. In the NOI's earliest days she helped establish and run the University of Islam and Muslim Girls Training schools, which provided education for NOI members' children, considered one of the nation's early versions of religious homeschooling. Like Fard Muhammad, the founder of the Nation of Islam, Sister Clara understood the importance of their follower’s education as a vehicle for success in a predominantly white society. She had more schooling than her husband, Elijah Muhammad, and assisted him in his studies in order for him to better understand assigned teachings and engage in activities that required literacy skills.   Within the University of Islam, both Fard and Clara supported the idea of wanting to protect their children from the racism experienced by black students in public schools, providing high level teaching in subjects such as math, science, and english, along with teachings on proper hygiene, astrology, and health. Many parents of students within the school expressed admiration for the school because it promoted values such as companionship, brotherhood, and aversion from trouble with the law. As for the students, they too valued the school's teachings, as it provided more information on their ancestors, spiritual teachings, and social difficulties experienced by blacks in the US- all of which helped to broaden their perspectives and learn more about their place in society.  However, children's attendance at the schools was considered truancy and resulted in prosecutions and violent confrontations between Temple members and police in Detroit, Michigan and Chicago, Illinois. Sister Clara faced challenges, including legal harassment when authorities tried to force her children back into public schools. She defended her decision to educate her children at the University of Islam, even at the risk of facing legal repercussions.  Death and legacy  Clara Muhammad died on August 12, 1972, after a long bout with stomach cancer. She was buried at Mount Glenwood Memory Gardens South in Glenwood, Illinois. Her son, Warith Deen Mohammed, who assumed leadership of the Nation of Islam in 1975, renamed the University of Islam schools the Sister Clara Muhammad Schools in her honor. There are now roughly 75 Clara Muhammad Schools across the country, including the Sister Clara Muhammad School in Boston, Massachusetts and in Atlanta, Georgia.   == References ==

Harold Frederick Switzer (January 16, 1925 – April 14, 1967) was an American child actor, most notable for appearing in the Our Gang short subjects series as an extra. He was the older brother of gang member Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer, one of the series' most popular and best-remembered characters.  Early life and family Switzer was born in Paris, Illinois, the first son of George Frederick (1905–1960) and Gladys C. Shanks Switzer (1904–1997). He and younger brother, Carl, became famous around their hometown for their musical talent and performances; both sang and played a number of instruments.  Our Gang The Switzers took a trip to California in 1934 to visit with family members. While sightseeing they eventually wound up at Hal Roach Studios. Following a public tour of the facility, 8-year-old Harold and 6-year-old Carl entered into the Hal Roach Studio's public cafeteria, the Our Gang Café, and began an impromptu performance. Producer Hal Roach was present at the commissary that day and was impressed by the performance. He signed both Switzers to appear in Our Gang.  Harold was given two nicknames, "Slim" and "Deadpan," and Carl was dubbed "Alfalfa." The Switzer brothers first appeared in the 1935 Our Gang short, Beginner's Luck. Harold played the mandolin, while both brothers sang She'll Be Comin' 'Round The Mountain. By the end of the year, due to his comedic timing and appearance, Carl was one of the main characters in the series, while Harold had more or less been relegated to the role of a background player. Harold notably wore a light blue shirt with navy blue overalls. Both Carl and Harold outgrew the series by 1940, with Slim's last appearance in The New Pupil.  Adult years and death Harold Switzer did not pursue an on-screen career after leaving the Our Gang series, and his Our Gang appearances would remain his only film credits. Though not saddled with the same problems his younger brother was faced with due to being typecast as a "child star," Harold had his own problems. For several years, he operated a  Speed Queen Company franchise, installing and servicing washers and dryers. In 1967, after killing a customer over a dispute, Switzer drove himself to a remote area in Inglewood, California and committed suicide. He was 42. Harold "Slim" Switzer is interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California, next to his father, George Frederick Switzer. Carl is on the other side of their father.  Personal life Switzer was married to Beverly Osso for six years. They had three children: Judith Ann, Tony Frederick and Teddy Berton. Switzer also fathered two children, Gladys and Dawn, with Rose Lavon.

Delaware Route 48 (DE 48) is a state highway in New Castle County, Delaware. The route runs from DE 41 in Hockessin east to U.S. Route 13 Business (US 13 Bus.) in downtown Wilmington. The route passes through suburban areas of Wilmington along Lancaster Pike, intersecting DE 100 and DE 141. DE 48 continues into Wilmington as Lancaster Avenue and intersects DE 2, where it splits into the one-way pair of Lancaster Avenue eastbound and Second Street westbound. Upon reaching downtown Wilmington, the route intersects Interstate 95 (I-95)/US 202 and DE 4 before continuing to the eastern terminus. What is now DE 48 was originally built as the Lancaster Pike in 1817, a turnpike that was to connect Wilmington to the Gap and Newport Turnpike. The turnpike became county-maintained in 1877. The Lancaster Pike was designated DE 48 by 1936, with the route continuing east through Wilmington to the Wilmington-Penns Grove Ferry across the Delaware River, where it connected to Route 48 in Penns Grove, New Jersey. The ferry was discontinued in 1949 and the eastern terminus of DE 48 was cut back to its current location by 1952.  Route description DE 48 begins at an intersection with DE 41 in Hockessin, heading southeast on Lancaster Pike, a two-lane undivided road. The road runs through wooded areas and residential development, crossing Loveville Road and Hyde Run before curving east and gaining a second westbound lane for trucks as it descends a hill. The route widens into a four-lane divided highway before crossing the Wilmington and Western Railroad at-grade and Red Clay Creek. The road passes residential areas and business parks as it crosses Centerville Road. DE 48 crosses Little Mill Creek and comes to an intersection with DE 100/DE 141, at which point DE 100 forms a concurrency with DE 48. The two routes head southeast as a four-lane undivided road, crossing Chestnut Run and passing through residential and commercial areas. The road crosses an East Penn Railroad line at-grade and runs to the north of a cemetery, with DE 100 splitting from DE 48 by turning south on South Dupont Road as it passes south of the Cab Calloway School of the Arts and Charter School of Wilmington.  DE 48 continues into the city of Wilmington as Lancaster Avenue and heads into urban areas of homes and businesses, with the eastbound direction narrowing to one lane at the intersection with Greenhill Avenue. Following this intersection, the route crosses over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line on a bridge. The road narrows to two lanes and passes to the north of another cemetery. The route intersects DE 2, which follows the one-way pair of Lincoln Street northbound and Union Street southbound, in the Union Park Gardens neighborhood. At this point, DE 48 itself splits into a one-way pair that follows Lancaster Avenue eastbound and West Second Street westbound, with westbound DE 48 using westbound DE 2 (North Union Street) to get from West Second Street to Lancaster Avenue. The one-way pair carries two lanes in each direction. DE 48 continues into downtown Wilmington, where it crosses under a viaduct carrying I-95/US 202, with ramp connections to and from the southbound direction of I-95/US 202 via Jackson Street, which parallels I-95/US 202 to the west.  Upon crossing under I-95/US 202, a westbound ramp to I-95/US 202 complements the eastbound direction of DE 48, with the road becoming Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, a six-lane divided highway. Westbound DE 48 remains along one-way West Second Street, which carries three lanes. DE 48 intersects the eastern terminus of DE 4, which provides access to DE 48 from the northbound direction of I-95/US 202. The one-way pair continues further into the downtown, passing to the south of the Orlando J. George, Jr. Campus of Delaware Technical Community College, and runs a short distance to the north of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad line. The route intersects the southbound direction of US 13 Bus., which shifts west from North King Street to South Market Street where it intersects DE 48. At this point, the westbound direction of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard ends. Following the intersection with US 13 Bus. southbound, DE 48 follows the one-way pair of Front Street eastbound and East Second Street westbound. Along this stretch, the route passes to the north of Wilmington Station along the Northeast Corridor that serves Amtrak and SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line, with the train station's parking garage and the Wilmington Bus Station serving Greyhound Lines buses located between Front Street and East Second Street west of the French Street intersection. DE 48 reaches its eastern terminus at an intersection with the northbound direction of US 13 Bus., which follows Walnut Street, west of the Wilmington Transit Center serving DART First State buses. DE 48 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 38,923 vehicles at the DE 4 intersection to a low of 11,223 vehicles at the Loveville Road intersection near Hockessin. The entire length of DE 48 is part of the National Highway System.  History The Wilmington Turnpike Company was founded on October 23, 1809 to build a turnpike from Wilmington to the Pennsylvania border, connecting to the Gap and Newport Turnpike. The turnpike was completed in 1817 at a cost of $39,549.97. The turnpike became known as the Lancaster Pike and was surfaced with stone. The Wilmington Turnpike Company operated the Lancaster Pike until 1877 when they abandoned the road. The turnpike's charter was repealed and the road was then under the control of the county levy court. The road leading from Wilmington to the Wilmington-Penns Grove Ferry across the Delaware River to Penns Grove, New Jersey, was completed as a state highway by 1931. By 1936, the Lancaster Pike became a part of DE 48. In addition, the route continued through Wilmington on Lincoln Street, Fourth Street, and Christiana Avenue to the ferry across the Delaware River to Penns Grove, New Jersey, which linked DE 48 to Route 48 in New Jersey. In 1939, DE 48 was rebuilt between DE 41 and Centre Road, eliminating curves and grades. In 1949, the Wilmington-Penns Grove Ferry was discontinued. DE 48 was realigned onto Lancaster Avenue to continue to US 13/US 202 (now US 13 Bus.), its current eastern terminus, by 1952. By 1990, DE 100 was realigned to follow a portion of DE 48, bypassing a part of Dupont Road. DE 48 was widened into a divided highway at the DE 141 intersection by 1996. The divided highway was extended west to Centerville Road a year later.  Major intersections The entire route is in New Castle County.

Dinocroc vs. Supergator is an 2010 American science fiction horror television film that premiered on Syfy on June 26, 2010. This is one of David Carradine's final performances. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on July 12, 2011; it was supposed to be a parody of King Kong vs. Godzilla.  Plot In Drake Industries Research Lab in Hawaii, two creatures – Dinocroc and Supergator – are being studied. However, Supergator breaks free from the lab and eats two scientists before escaping into the water. Dinocroc also breaks free by breaking the wall and crushing another scientist. It also eats two scientists and goes into the trees. Jason Drake calls an elite mercenary group to kill the creatures, but they are killed by Dinocroc. Drake then calls in Fish & Game hunter Bob Logan who is also known as "the Cajun" to kill the two creatures. While spying on Drake's lab, Paul Beaumont meets a wildlife officer, Cassidy Swanson. While Drake has his private party, he meets up with a girl named Victoria Chase. Drake tells her to meet up with the Cajun. The Cajun meets with Victoria and they both go on a boat and down the river. They hear a woman – Kimberly Taft – asking for help, and they help her in the jeep while Dinocroc chases after them. Cassidy and her father attempt to shoot at Supergator. Cassidy's father, Charlie, shoots Supergator's eye, presumably blinding it, and is devoured. As Supergator eats Charlie, Cassidy gets in the car and drives off. Supergator then chases her all the way to the mill. As Supergator reaches the end of the tunnel, Bob and Paul blow it up with C-4 explosives so Supergator and Dinocroc cannot escape. The two reptiles engage in battle and in the melee they rupture the containers housing the mill's stores of sawdust. The fight continues, in which Dinocroc wins after knocking Supergator on its soft underbelly and attacking it. Paul then runs forward to get in range so he can throw an explosive to set off all the sawdust. After Dinocroc kills Supergator, it spots Paul and walks towards him, as Paul hides in a trough filled with water, protecting himself from the explosives. The bomb explodes and ignites the sawdust to create a massive fireball, knocking back and killing Dinocroc. Paul is assumed to be killed as well, but he survives the attack. Before Paul and Cassidy leave, the camera then turns to Dinocroc and Supergator, both dead. As Bob, Paul and Cassidy walk away, it shows that in the mill are babies, of either Dinocroc or Supergator – possibly both.  Cast Corey Landis as Paul Beaumont Amy Rasimas as Cassidy Swanson Rib Hillis as "The Cajun" Bob Logan John Callahan as Charlie Swanson Lisa Clapperton as Victoria Delia Sheppard as Kimberly Taft James Burns as FBI Agent David Carradine as Jason Drake  Production Roger Corman gave Syfy the idea, but they did not know if they wanted to do it. Corman filmed it anyway and hoped that Syfy would buy the rights for television.  Home video Dinocroc vs. Supergator was released on DVD and Blu-ray on July 12, 2011 by Anchor Bay Entertainment.  Reception Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly called the film an "impeccable Saturday-night junk entertainment", but later added that "[he'd] rather watch a TV-movie like this than CSI: Miami or America's Got Talent any night."  See also "Series" Dinocroc, the 1st film in the so-called series. Supergator, the 2nd film in the so-called series. Commentators indeed insist that the film has "nothing to do" with Dinocroc nor Supergator.  Other Nessie & Me, the character Jack O'Grady mentions the Dinocroc/Supergator and the Piranhaconda when he encounters Nessie at the beginning of the movie, but those films are not related to this film.

The Algonquin people are an Indigenous people who now live in Eastern Canada. They speak the Algonquin language, which is part of the Algonquian language family. Culturally and linguistically, they are closely related to the Odawa, Potawatomi, Ojibwe (including Oji-Cree), Mississaugas, and Nipissing, with whom they form the larger Anicinàpe (Anishinaabeg). Algonquins are known by many names, including Omàmiwinini (plural: Omàmiwininiwak, "downstream man/men") and Abitibiwinni (pl.: Abitibiwinnik "men [living] halfway across the water") or the more generalised name of Anicinàpe. Though known by several names in the past, such as Algoumequin, the most common term "Algonquin" has been suggested to derive from the Maliseet word elakómkwik (IPA: [ɛlæˈɡomoɡwik]): "they are our relatives/allies." The much larger heterogeneous group of Algonquian-speaking peoples, who, according to Brian Conwell, stretch from Virginia to the Rocky Mountains and north to Hudson Bay, was named after the tribe. Most Algonquins live in Quebec. The nine recognized status Algonquin bands in that province and one in Ontario have a combined population of about 17,002. In addition, there are additional non-status communities, some of which are controversial. Algonquins are original Indigenous People of southern Quebec and eastern Ontario in Canada. Many Algonquins still speak the Algonquin language, called generally Anicinàpemowin or specifically Omàmiwininìmowin. The language is considered one of several divergent dialects of the Anishinaabe languages. Among younger speakers, the Algonquin language has experienced strong word borrowings from the Cree language. Traditionally, the Algonquins lived in either birch bark or wooden mìkiwàms. Traditionally, the Algonquins were practitioners of Midewiwin (the Path of the Heart). They believed they were surrounded by many manitòk or spirits in the natural world. French missionaries converted many Algonquins to Catholicism in the 17th and 18th centuries. Today, many Algonquin practice traditional Midewiwin or a syncretic merging of Christianity and Midewiwin. In the oral history of the Great Anishinaabeg Migration, the Algonquins say they migrated from the Atlantic coast. Together with other Anicinàpek, they arrived at the "First Stopping Place" near Montreal. While the other Anicinàpe peoples continued their journey up the St. Lawrence River, the Algonquins settled along Kitcisìpi (the Ottawa River), a long-important highway for commerce, cultural exchange and transportation. Algonquin identity, though, was not fully realized until after the dividing of the Anicinàpek at the "Third Stopping Place". Scholars have used the oral histories, archeology, and linguistics to estimate this took place about 2000 years ago, near present-day Detroit. After contact with the Europeans, especially the French and Dutch, the Algonquin nations became active in the fur trade. This led them to fight against the powerful Haudenosaunee, whose confederacy was based in present-day New York. In 1570, the Algonquins formed an alliance with the Innu (Montagnais) to the east, whose territory extended to the ocean. Culturally, Omàmìwininì (Algonquin) and the Mississaugas (Michi Saagiig) were not part of the Ojibwe–Odawa–Potawatomi alliance known as the Council of Three Fires, though they did maintain close ties. Omàmìwininìwak (Algonquins) maintained stronger cultural ties with the Wendat, Abenaki, Atikamekw, and Cree, along with the Innu, as related above.  French contact Algonquin first met Europeans when Samuel de Champlain came upon a party led by the Kitcisìpirini Chief Tessouat at Tadoussac, in eastern present-day Quebec, in the summer of 1603. They were celebrating a recent victory over the Iroquois, with the allied Montagnais and Etchemins (Malecite). Champlain did not understand that Algonquins were socially united by a strong totem/clan system rather than the European-styled political concept of nationhood. The several Algonquin bands each had its own chief. Within each band, the chief depended on political approval from each of the band's clan leaders. Champlain needed to cultivate relationships with numerous chiefs and clan leaders. From 1603, some of the Algonquins allied with the French under Champlain. This alliance proved useful to the Algonquin, who previously had little to no access to European firearms. Champlain made his first exploration of the Ottawa River during May 1613 and reached the fortified Kitcisìpirini village at Morrison Island. Unlike the other Algonquin communities, the Kitcisìpiriniwak did not change location with the seasons. They had chosen a strategic point astride the trade route between the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. They prospered through the collection of beaver pelts from Indigenous traders passing through their territory. They also were proud of their corn fields. At first, the French used the term "Algonquin" only for a second group, the Wàwàckeciriniwak. However, by 1615, they applied the name to all of the Algonquin bands living along the Ottawa River. Because of keen interest by tribes to gain control of the lower Ottawa River, the Kitcisìpiriniwak and the Wàwàckeciriniwak came under fierce opposition. These two large groups allied together, under the leadership of Sachem (Carolus) Charles Pachirini, to maintain the Omàmiwinini identity and territory.  French-Indian War/Seven Years' War The Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee) drove Algonquins from their lands. The Haudenosaunee were aided by having been traded arms by the Dutch, and later by the English. The Haudenosaunee and the English defeated the French and Algonquins in the 1620s, and, led by Sir David Kirke, occupied New France. In 1623, having realized the occupation of New France demonstrated French colonial vulnerability, the French began to trade muskets to Algonquins and their allies. French Jesuits began to seek Algonquin conversions to Roman Catholicism. Through all of these years, the Haudenosaunee never attacked the Kitcisìpirinik fortress. But, in 1642, they made a surprise winter raid, attacking Algonquins while most of their warriors were absent, and causing severe casualties. On March 6, 1647 (Ash Wednesday), a large Kanienkehaka (Mohawk) war party attacked the Kitcisìpiriniwak living near Trois-Rivières and almost exterminated them. The Kitcisìpiriniwak were still at Morrison Island in 1650 and inspired respect with their 400 warriors. When the French retreated from Wendat (Huron) country that year, Tessouat was reported to have had the superior of the Jesuit mission suspended by his armpits because he refused to offer him the customary presents for being allowed to travel through Algonquin territory. Some joined the mission at Sillery, where they were mostly destroyed by an infectious disease epidemic by 1676. Encouraged by the French, others remained at Trois-Rivières. Their settlement at nearby Pointe-du-Lac continued until about 1830. That year the last 14 families, numbering about 50, moved to Kanesatake near Oka. (The families who stayed in Trois Rivieres can be found in the Algonquin census of Trois Rivieres in the mid-19th century).  History 18th Century to Present The Lake of Two Mountains band of Algonquins were located just west of the Island of Montreal, and were signatories to the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. The Sulpician Mission of the Mountain was founded at Montreal in 1677. In 1717, the King of France granted the Mohawk in Quebec a tract of land 9 miles long by 9 miles wide about 40 miles to the northwest of Montreal, under the condition that they leave the island of Montreal. Sulpician Missionaries set up a trading post at the village in 1721 and attracted a large number of Haudenosaunee converts to Christianity to the area. The settlement of Kanesatake was formally founded as a Catholic mission, a seigneury under the supervision of the Sulpician Order for 300 Christian Mohawk, about 100 Algonquins, and approximately 250 Nipissing peoples "in their care". Over time the Sulpicians claimed total control of the land, gaining a deed that gave them legal title. But the Haudenosaunee (Mohawks), Algonquins, and Nipissing understood that this land was being held in trust for them. The Sulpician mission village of Lake of Two Mountains (Lac des Deux Montagnes), west of Montreal, became known both by its Algonquin language name Oka (meaning "pickerel"), and the Mohawk language Kanehsatà:ke ("sandy place"); however, Algonquin also called the village as Ganashtaageng after the Mohawk language name. Algonquin warriors continued to fight in alliance with France until the British conquest of Quebec in 1760, during the Seven Years' War. After the British took over colonial rule of Canada, their officials sought to make allies of the First Nations, and the Algonquin, along with many other First Nations signed the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which was then ratified in 1764 as the Treaty of Niagara. Subsequently, fighting on behalf of the British Crown, Algonquins took part in the Barry St Leger campaign during the American Revolutionary War. Following the American Revolutionary War, and later the War of 1812, the Lake of Two Mountains Algonquins found their territory increasingly encroached on by Loyalist settlers. Beginning in the 1820s and 1930s, the lumber industry began to move up the Ottawa valley. Algonquin became increasingly displaced as a result. Beginning in the 1820s, Algonquin Grand Chief Constant Pinesi sent a series of letters petitioning the British Crown for Algonquin Territorial Recognition previously agreed upon in the Treaties of 1701 and 1764, ratified by Algonquins and the British Crown. No responses were forthcoming from the British, and the Algonquins began to be relegated to a string of small reserves beginning in the 1830s. Algonquins who agreed to move to these reserves or joined other historical bands were federally "recognized". Others maintained their attachment to the traditional territory and fur trading, and chose not to re-locate. These Algonquins were later called "stragglers" in the Ottawa and Pontiac counties with some eventually settling in small towns such as Renfrew, Whitney, and Eganville as the 19th Century progressed. Many of these Algonquins were not recognized as "Status Indians". The location of the former Lake of Two Mountains Band came to be known as Kahnesatake. As a large majority of the Algonquin population had left the area, with only the Christian Haudenosaunee and a few Algonquins remaining, it became recognized as a Mohawk reserve (though many in the community have at least partial Algonquin Ancestry). Algonquins living in the northern regions of Algonquin Territory gradually moved to towns such as present day Témiscaming, and Mattawa, amongst others in Ontario and Quebec, as territorial encroachment by settlers, and lumber and resource companies increased throughout the 19th and 20th Centuries or various reserves set up in their traditional territories.  Economy Historical Algonquin society was largely hunting and fishing-based. Being primarily a hunting nation, the people emphasized mobility. They used materials that were light and easy to transport. Canoes were made of birch bark, sewed with spruce roots and rendered waterproof by the application of heated spruce resin and bear grease. During winter, toboggans were used to transport material, and people used snowshoes to get around. The women used tikinaagan (cradleboards) to carry their babies. It was built with wood and covered with an envelope made of leather or material. The baby was standing up with his feet resting on a small board. The mother would then put the tikinàgan on her back. This allowed the infant to look around and observe his surroundings. The child was kept close to the mother but also had much stimulation. Algonquian-speaking people also practiced agriculture, particularly south of the Great Lakes, where the climate allows for a longer growing season. Notable indigenous crops historically farmed by Algonquins are the sunflower and tobacco. Around 800CE, Eastern Algonquins adopted maize agriculture from their neighbors in the interior. Even among groups who mainly hunted, agricultural products were an important source of food. They obtained what was needed by trading with or raiding societies that practiced more agriculture. Eastern Algonquins created pots that could withstand not only thermal stress but the mechanical stress of rough use. Archaeological sites on Morrison Island near Pembroke, within the territory of the later Kitcisìpiriniwak, reveal a 1,000-year-old culture that manufactured copper tools and weapons. Copper ore was extracted north of Lake Superior and distributed down to present-day northern New York. Local pottery artifacts from this period show widespread similarities that indicate the continuing use of the river for cultural exchange throughout the Canadian Shield and beyond. Beginning at the latest in c. 1 CE, the Algonquin Nation inhabited the islands and shores along Kitcisìpi (Algonquin Language name translating to The Great River, known now as the Ottawa River). By the 17th century European Explorers found them well established as a hunter-gatherer society in control of the river. On Morrison Island, at the location where 5,000-year-old copper artifacts were discovered, the Kitcisìpiriniwak levied a toll on canoe flotillas descending the river.  Ethnobotany Algonquins of Quebec gather the berries of Ribes glandulosum and Viburnum nudum var. cassinoides as food, and eat and sell the fruit of Vaccinium myrtilloides. They take an infusion of Epigaea repens leaves for kidney disorders and apply a poultice of the gum or needles of Abies balsamea to open sores, insect bites, boils and infections. The needles are a sudatory for women after childbirth and are infused for a laxative tea, while the roots treat heart disease.  Modern events In recent years, tensions with the lumber industry have flared up again among Algonquin communities, in response to the practice of clear-cutting. In Ontario, an Algonquin land claim has been ongoing since 1983, encompassing much of the southeastern part of the province, stretching from near North Bay to near Hawkesbury and including Ottawa, Pembroke, and most of Algonquin Provincial Park. The Algonquins never relinquished title to this area. An agreement-in-principle between the Algonquins of Ontario, the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario was reached in 2015. Many Algonquins dispute both the validity of both this settlement and the organization of the Algonquins of Ontario as a whole. In 2000, Algonquins from Timiskaming First Nation played a significant part in the local popular opposition to the plan to convert Adams Mine into a garbage dump.  Communities At the time of their first meeting with the French in 1603, the various Algonquin bands probably had a combined population somewhere in the neighborhood of 6,000. The British estimate in 1768 was 1,500. As of 2000, there are close to 8,000 Algonquins in Canada, organized into ten separate First Nations: nine in Quebec and one in Ontario.  Historic Algonquian Nations documented as early as 1630:  Quebec Kichesipirini ("people of the great river") — They were the largest and most powerful group of Algonquins. Known variously as: Kitcisìpirini, Kitcisìpiriniwak, Algoumequins de l'Isle-aux-Allumettes, Big River People, Gens d l'Isle, Honkeronon (Wyandot language), Island Algonquian, Island Indians, Island Nation, People from the Island, Kichesippiriniwek, Nation de l'Isle, Nation of the Isle, and Savages de l'Isle. Their main village was on Morrison Island. Kinounchepirini ("people of the Pickerel-waters") — Also known as Keinouche, Kinouchebiiriniwek, Kinònjepìriniwak, Kinonche, Pickerel, Pike and Quenongebin. Sometimes they were listed as an Algonquian band, but after 1650 they were associated with the Ottawa and were originally found along the lower Ottawa River below Allumette Island. Otaguottaouemin — Also known as Kotakoutouemi or Outaoukotwemiwek. They were located along the Upper Ottawa River above Allumette Island. Sàgaiganininiwak ("people of the lake") — Also known as Saghiganirini. Saginitaouigama — Also known as Sagachiganiriniwek. Weskarini ("people of the deer[-clan]") — Also known as the Wàwàckeciriniwak, La Petite Nation, Little Nation, Ouaouechkairini, Ouassouarini, Ouescharini, Ouionontateronon (Wyandot language), or Petite Nation. Their traditional home land is located on the north side of the Ottawa River along the Lievre River and the Rouge River in Quebec.  Ontario Iroquet — They were known as Hiroquet, Hirocay, Iroquay, Yroquetto, and to the Huron as the Atonontrataronon or Ononchataronon; they lived along Ontario's South Nation River. Matàwackariniwak "people of the bulrushed-shore" — Also known as Madawaska, Madwaska, Matouchkarine, Matouashita, Mataouchkarini, Matouechkariniwek and Matouescarini; the Madawaska River in the Upper Ottawa Valley is named after this band. Nibachis — Located at Muskrat Lake near present-day Cobden, Ontario.

The New City Free Library is a library located in New City, New York. Established as a single room in New City School in 1936, it has expanded into a 32,000-square-foot (3,000 m2) facility with over 200,000 volumes.  History The library was officially launched on June 19, 1936, in response to a plan by the New York State Education Department to provide citizens of rural areas with library service. It began as a room in the New City School, opening one afternoon a week, but as the book collection of the library increased, space quickly became a concern. Funding also became a concern, particularly in 1950 when the New City School was no longer able to provide space or finances for the library. With grants and public donations, including a donation of land by the New City Fire Department, the library broke ground on a free-standing building on May 3, 1952. The library opened to the public on July 11, 1953, remaining open for 12 hours each week. As library membership and book collections continued to grow, the library expanded its hours and staff, also increasing its capacity with the addition of a trailer in the early 1960s. When the New City Fire Department deemed the building safe for occupancy only by 14 patrons at a time in 1965, a vote was held to appropriate sufficient funds for the library to purchase a new location, to which it moved on January 2, 1967. In 1977, the library purchased 3 acres (12,000 m2) of land. After budget was approved for the construction of a much larger building in December 2007, ground was broken in November 1978. The new facility contained 20,600 square feet (1,910 m2) as well as a generous allocation for parking for 120 cars. With community support, the library took possession of its new property on January 19, 1980. Over subsequent years, the building has been expanded with 10,700 square feet (990 m2) additional, including a children's wing, a circulation lobby and a basement which houses a technical services department and an audiovisual department. The current facility hosts over 200,000 volumes in 32,000 square feet (3,000 m2).  Sources True, Patricia (1970).

Apolinary Stanisław Kotowicz (24 March 1859 – 21 April 1917) was a Polish painter of landscapes, portraits and genre scenes. He was also a set decorator and amateur photographer.  Biography Kotowicz was born on 24 March 1859 in Biecz. His father, Antoni Kotowicz (1816-1885) was a medical doctor and naturalist from Lwów. He began his education in Tarnów. In 1878, he moved to Kraków, where he spent most of his adult life. Through 1887, he studied at the Academy of Fine arts with Jan Matejko (history painting) and Władysław Łuszczkiewicz (drawing and anatomy). After graduating, he spent two years in Munich on a scholarship, where he studied at a private school operated by Simon Hollósy, who took him on field trips to the Hungarian countryside. Upon returning home, he began to exhibit regularly at the showings of the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts. From 1894 to 1895, he was one of the artists who participated in creating the Panorama Tatr, a view of the Tatra Mountains that measured 115 meters (337 ft.) by 16 meters (52 ft.), making it the largest Polish panorama and the only one to feature a landscape rather than historical scenes. It was on display in Warsaw for three years (1896-1899), when the promoters went bankrupt and it was sold to Jan Styka, a panorama painter. It disappeared during World War I.  From 1898 to 1903, he was the decorator at the Kraków Municipal Theatre. He also designed playbills and posters and illustrated the first edition of Tamten, a play by Gabriela Zapolska. In 1904, he returned to his native countryside, settled in Jasło, and taught drawing at the local gymnasium, where he painted a "Vision of Saint Francis" for the school chapel. Together with Włodzimierz Tetmajer (an associate from the Panorama Tatr) he created decorations for the parish church in Biecz. He was also involved in the cataloguing and preservation of local monuments. Following the Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive, he painted scenes of the destruction in the vicinity of Jasło. He died in Jasło during the German occupation in 21 April 1917.  References Further reading W. Gajewska, "Apolinary Stanisław Kotowicz. Artysta malarz 1859 – 1917" in Rocznik Jasielski vol.

Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar (IAST: Bhakti-rakṣaka Śrīdhara; 10 October 1895 – 12 August 1988) was an Indian guru, writer, sannyasi and spiritual leader in the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, founder-president-acharya of the Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math. Recognised as a "profound thinker" and "learned representative of the theistic conception of Gaudiya Vaishnavism", Sridhar was a senior disciple of Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati and elder "godbrother" (i.e. received initiation from the same guru) to A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (the ‘Hare Krishnas’), to whose young disciples he provided spiritual guidance after Prabhupada's passing in 1977.  Early life Born Ramendra Chandra (Rāmendra Candra) into a family of a high-class Bengali brahmins (his family bore the aristocratic title, or upādhi, of Bhattacharya), Sridhar joined his guru's mission, the Gaudiya Math, in 1926, taking diksha initiation from Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati as Ramendra Sundara (Rāmendra Sundara). On the meaning of his first spiritual name, Sridhar recalled: “My original name was Ramendra Candra. When I was given initiation, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakura gave me the name Ramendra Sundara. I asked him, “What is the meaning of Ramendra?” He told me, “In our consideration, Rama does not mean Dasarathi Rama or Lord Ramacandra, the son of King Dasaratha. It means Radha-ramana Rama – Krsna, the lover of Radharani.” Before being sent by Saraswati to locate the site where Chaitanya Mahaprabhu spoke with Ramananda Ray on the banks of the Godavari (Rāmānanda Saṁvāda), his guru gave him the new name Ramananda Das (Rāmānanda dāsa), meaning servant of Ramananda. He finally became Bhakti Rakshak, meaning 'Guardian of Devotion', after taking sannyasa in 1930.  Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math In 1941, after the death of his guru, Sridhar founded his own international mission, becoming acharya of the monastic and missionary society "Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math," in Nabadwip, now in West Bengal. His chosen successor was his disciple, Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswami, who led the math until his death in 2010.  Relationship with Prabhupada Though "something of an outsider in his spiritual master's original movement", Prabhupada, ISKCON's founder, had "strong friendships with two prominent sannyasi godbrothers, Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar (1895–1983)  [sic], founder of the Chaitanya Saraswata Math, and Bhakti Prajnan Keshava (1898–1968), founder of the Gaudiya Vedanta Samiti." After Prabhupada's death in 1977, Sridhar Maharaja gave instruction to Prabhupada's disciples, with Americans Bhaktivedanta Tripurari and Jayatirtha Swami and Hungarian devotee Dvarakesa Swami (Bhakti Abhay Narayan) among the prominent ex-ISKCON members to take shiksha or sannyasa initiation from Sridhar. Prabhupada and Sridhar were close, having a "long and intimate relationship" over almost five decades. Prabhupada described Sridhar as the "most highly competent of all my godbrothers" and "even my shiksha-guru". He had previously asked Sridhar to be president of the new institution he planned to set up following the disintegration of the original Gaudiya Math. He later described how Sridhar had agreed to "cooperate with our society" (ISKCON), and had his disciples honour Sridhar's Vyasa-puja (birthday), in order than ISKCON's young brahmacharis “shall learn how to celebrate the spiritual master's birthday.”  Honorifics In a Gaudiya Vaishnava context, Sridhar's full title is Srila Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj, (where Śrīla, an adjectival form of Śrī, is a respectful honorific akin to 'Reverend',  and Mahārāja means 'Great King', while Gosvāmī reflects his status as a sannyasi). He is known simply as Srila Guru Maharaj within Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math.  References External links Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math International

Zenodotion (Ancient Greek: Ζηνοδότιον), or Zenodotium or Zenodotia, was a city in Mesopotamia that was destroyed in the 1st century BCE. Zenodotion was a polis of Osroene near Nicephorium (modern Raqqa, in Syria), though we do not know its exact location. It may have been a native Mesopotamian town, a Greek colony, or a colony founded on or adjacent to a native town. The writer Plutarch mentions this city, saying the Greeks called it Zenodotion, implying that its inhabitants might have called it something else. The historian Cassius Dio thought it was a Greek and Macedonian colony. The classical scholar William Woodthorpe Tarn suggested that, like the Phrygian city of Docimium, Zenodotion was a city named after the military officer who first settled it. It is possible that the city was founded by a man in the army of Alexander the Great or Antigonus I Monophthalmus, or a member of the Seleucid Empire, but there is no compelling evidence to show the way here.  Destruction Plutarch tells the story of the invasion of Marcus Licinius Crassus into the region, and how Zenodotion, ruled by Apollonius, was the only city that offered significant resistance. It symbolically surrendered to the overwhelming Roman army, and as was common, requested a garrison, and was granted one: a Roman century, approximately 100 men. One night the people of Zenodotion took the century by surprise and executed all of its members. For this, Crassus sacked and destroyed the city, and sold its inhabitants into slavery. He later hailed himself as Imperator for this feat, which attracted the scorn of his contemporaries, as this was not considered that impressive a victory at all.   == Notes ==

Rahul Chandran (born 1976) is the first Executive Director of the Global Alliance for Humanitarian Innovation.  GAHI was a major outcome of the World Humanitarian Summit. He was previously a thought leader on United Nations reform, working across the fields of development, conflict and security, widely known for his work on resilience, statebuilding and humanitarian change. Chandran was the author and managing editor of Humanitarianism in the Network Age, a major report on the future of humanitarian action. The report argued that information was a basic need in crisis response and was described as ground-breaking and a "turning point for the use of mobile and ICT in humanitarian crises and the protection of human rights". Chandran has also led various efforts on UN reform, including around the Sustainable Development Goals, and the International Review of Civilian Capacity Secretariat, a reform process for the United Nations. Prior to this, Chandran was the Deputy Director at the Center on International Cooperation(CIC). At CIC, Chandran, along with the Director, Bruce D. Jones, and Richard Gowan, helped to make CIC one of the most influential think-tanks working on conflict and security issues. While at CIC, Chandran ran the Afghanistan Reconstruction Program, working for Barnett Rubin before his appointment as Senior Advisor to Richard Holbrooke. Chandran was the lead author of From Fragility to Resilience, a policy paper for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that provided new definitions for State-building and resilience. The paper was highly influential in the world of conflict policy. First, it restored the idea that political settlement was essential to social contract stability. Second, it defined building resilience as the goal of international assistance to conflict countries. Third, it renewed the focus on legitimacy. This work has been taken forward in a number of other fora – on political settlements most notably by Alan Whaites and DfiD, as well as the World Bank’s 2011 World Development Report, and on legitimacy by the OECD's International Network on Conflict and Fragility. Chandran was also the lead author of Recovering From War a report commissioned by the UK Government ahead of its 20 May 2008 thematic debate in the United Nations Security Council. Recovering from War defined three primary weaknesses in the international response to conflict:  A strategy gap – observing "no evidence of strategy that encompassed political, security, development and humanitarian tools across bilateral and multi-lateral actors;  and no framework for prioritization." A financing gap – noting that financing "instruments are neither flexible nor dynamic." A series of capacity gaps – in leadership capacity; in implementation capacity; in sheer availability of civilian resources, and in a lack of training for purpose. These findings formed the basis of then Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s address to the Security Council, and the subsequent debate. They have also launched a series of processes to address these, with considerable success on the capacity gap through the Review of Civilian Capacities; some progress on the financing gap through the OECD/DAC process on financing and aid architecture; and negligible process on the strategy gap. Chandran has previously worked for the World Bank on participatory monitoring and evaluation issues, and for the UN in Afghanistan, where he wrote a popular Diaries Diaries column for Slate Magazine.  Before this, he had a successful private sector career, involved with ESPNCricinfo and Rely Software Rely Software among others. He was also a paralegal on Pigford v. Glickman one of the largest civil rights actions in US history. Chandran currently serves on the Expert Advisory Group of the Partnership for Democratic Governance for whom he wrote Statebuilding and Government Consolidation in Situations of Fragility, and the Consortium Advisory Group for DfID’s Secure livelihoods research consortium.  Education Chandran is a graduate of Yale University and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  Select Publications Chandran, Rahul (2015). It's Broke, So Fix It: Humanitarian Response in Crisis.

Fleance (also spelled Fléance, ) is a figure in legendary Scottish history. He was depicted by 16th-century historians as the son of Lord Banquo, Thane of Lochaber, and the ancestor of the kings of the House of Stuart. Fleance is best known as a character in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, in which the Three Witches prophesy that Banquo's descendants shall be kings. Some screen adaptations of the story expand on Fleance's role by showing his return to the kingdom after Macbeth's death. Shakespeare's play is adapted from Holinshed's Chronicles, a history of the British Isles written during the late 16th century. In Holinshed, Fleance escapes Macbeth and flees to England, where he fathers a son who later becomes the first hereditary steward to the King of Scotland. In real life, 'Steward' eventually became the name 'Stewart' (later changed to a pseudo Frenchification 'Stuart'), and Walter Stewart married Princess Marjorie, daughter of Robert the Bruce. Their son, Robert II, began the Stewart/Stuart line of kings in Scotland. James VI and I, son of Mary, Queen of Scots, was the ninth Stewart/Stuart monarch (eighth king) of Scotland and the first of the Stuart monarchs of England and Ireland. James VI & I was the reigning monarch when William Shakespeare wrote and produced Macbeth, which may have been in the new king's honour.  History Fleance and his father Banquo are both fictional characters presented as historical fact by the Scottish historian Hector Boece, whose Scotorum Historiae (1526–27) was a source for Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles, a history of the British Isles popular in Shakespeare's time. In the Chronicles, Fleance – in fear of Macbeth – flees to Wales and marries Nesta, daughter of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, the last native Prince of Wales. They have a son named Walter who makes his way back to Scotland and is appointed Royal Steward. According to legend, he fathered the Stuart monarchs of England and Scotland. The Stuarts used their connection with Fleance and his marriage to the Welsh princess to claim a genealogical link with the legendary King Arthur. This, they hoped, would strengthen the legitimacy of their claim to the throne. In 1722, however, Richard Hay, a Scottish historian, presented strong evidence that not only was James not a descendant of Fleance, but also that neither Fleance nor Banquo ever even existed. Most modern scholars now agree that Fleance is not a real historical figure.  In Macbeth Fleance appears in Shakespeare's Macbeth. However, only his childhood is portrayed; the rest of his story, as it is described in Holinshed's Chronicles, does not appear in Shakespeare's play. Scholars suggest that Shakespeare does not elaborate on Fleance's life after his escape from Scotland to avoid unnecessary distraction from the story of Macbeth himself. In Act 1, Macbeth and Banquo meet the Three Witches who foretell that Macbeth will be king and that Banquo "shalt get kings, though thou be none". Fleance also briefly appears in the first scene of Act 2, when his father tells him of "cursed thoughts that nature / Gives way to in repose!". Macbeth, aware of the threat Banquo and his son pose to his new throne, plans to have them murdered. Before Banquo goes travelling, Macbeth asks "Goes Fleance with you?" Macbeth sends three men to follow and kill them both, saying "Fleance['s] absence is no less material to me / Than is his father's." Macbeth holds a banquet that night and reveals to his wife his fears of what might happen unless Fleance and Banquo are both killed.  Banquo and Fleance are ambushed and while Banquo holds the assailants off he cries "Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly! / Thou mayst revenge." When the murderers return to Macbeth and report their failure to kill Fleance, he says, "Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect, / Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, / As broad and general as the casing air: / But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in / To saucy doubts and fears." Macbeth later meets the Three Witches again and is shown a vision of a long line of kings descended from Banquo.  Analysis In the first scene of Act 2, Fleance meets his father, who asks him to take his sword and tells him he is reluctant to go to bed due to the "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!"  On Macbeth's approach, however, Banquo demands the sword be returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king. Doing so would make the throne more available for Fleance, and would fulfill the Three Witches' prophecy that his sons would become kings. Since Banquo's good nature is revolted by these thoughts, he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure he does not act on them. Still, he is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands their return. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams have nothing to do with him killing the king, but that they have revealed to him Macbeth's bloody nature. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night, but when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had these dark dreams about Macbeth, takes back his sword as a precaution. In any case, this scene adds to the dark, uncertain, unsettling tone of the play. Fleance and his father are not even certain of what time it is throughout, as Fleance says when asked at the beginning of the scene "The moon is down; I have not heard the clock." The two scenes in which murderers attack Banquo and Fleance, Lady Macduff and Macduff's son, have been compared to Herod's attempt to murder Christ and save the throne for himself by killing all new-born children in Bethlehem. The conversation between Fleance and Banquo in their own murder scene is especially dark. Banquo's first line from within "Give us a light there, ho!" communicates the nighttime setting. The stage direction "Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE, with a torch", seems to foreshadow the fact that Fleance is a light for Scotland in the midst of the play's black deeds. When Macbeth returns to the witches later in the play, they show him an apparition of the murdered Banquo, along with eight kings of his family, descending through Fleance. King James, on the throne when Macbeth was written, was the ninth Stuart king. This scene thus suggests strong support for James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, was a tangible fulfilment of the witches' prophecy. The apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.  Theatre scholar Marvin Rosenberg theorises that Macbeth has a son, and interprets the play as commenting on the rivalries between pairs of father and son: Banquo and Fleance, Macduff and his son, Macbeth and his.  He argues that the tension that exists between Fleance and Macbeth is made stronger if Macbeth has a child: his motive is not just selfish striving, but also fatherly ambition for his own son. But this interpretation is flawed because in IV:iii, as soon as Macduff hears that MacBeth  has murdered his whole family, he says: "He has no children." Some productions of Macbeth imply that the Macbeths have lost a child, or show this tenderness by having the title character attempt to pat Fleance on the head, when Fleance withdraws to his father's side.  Theatre and screen versions Theatre and screen versions of Macbeth have sometimes elaborated on Fleance's role. In Orson Welles's film version of Macbeth (1948), Fleance is briefly seen again at the very end of the movie. He does not speak in this scene, but he has returned to Scotland with the army of Malcolm and Macduff, and is shown along with those hailing Malcolm as the new king after the killing of Macbeth. The BBC Shakespeare version of Macbeth shows Fleance in the final scene, implying his future role in bringing Banquo's line to the throne. In Joe MacBeth (1955), the first film to transpose Macbeth into a gang and Mafia-like setting, Fleance is replaced by a character named Lenny. Lenny's father, Banky, is killed, but Lenny escapes, and gathers a group of angry mobsters to overthrow Macbeth, who has, through a series of murders, made himself the kingpin gangster in the area. Lenny is successful in killing Macbeth in the end, but only after Macbeth has murdered most of his family. In another gangster adaptation, Men of Respect (1991), Fleance is replaced by a character named Phil, who similarly helps overthrow Mike (Macbeth) after his father, Bankie (Banquo), is murdered. Phil is inducted into the gang at the end of the film, when Mal (Malcolm) has taken over, suggesting that the violent gang culture will continue through generations. This sentiment echoes into the final scenes of Penny Woolcock's Macbeth on the Estate. Macduff shoots Macbeth and takes a ring (representing his high status) off Macbeth's finger. Entering a bar, he flips it to Malcolm, saying, "Hail, king." Malcolm puts it on with some show and elbows his way to the front of the bar. One of the characters he elbows is Fleance (a skinhead), who makes a mock gun out of his fingers and "shoots" at the back of the darker-skinned Malcolm's skull. Again this makes it clear that the violence will not end with the new generation. In Throne of Blood, a Japanese adaptation of the play, Fleance is replaced by Yoshiteru, a character played by Akira Kubo. The Macbeth and Banquo characters, Washizu and Miki, are told by an old woman spinning wool in a hut that while Washizu will rule the Forest Castle one day, Miki's son Yoshiteru will eventually inherit it for himself. Washizu takes the throne and at one point is about to make Yoshiteru his heir, but changes his mind when his wife tells him she is pregnant. Washizu instead arranges to have Yoshiteru and his father killed, but Yoshiteru escapes. Another adaptation filmed in India, Maqbool (2003), replaces Fleance with a character named Guddu. Maqbool (Macbeth) attempts to have Guddu murdered to strengthen power within the organised crime circle. Guddu, however, survives and marries the daughter of the former crime lord. In Macbett, Eugène Ionesco's 1972 stage adaptation, Fleance is merged with the Malcolm character. Macol (Malcolm), who is thought to be King Duncan's son, is revealed to be Banco's (Banquo's). Duncan, wanting a male heir, adopted Macol. Macol fills the role of Malcolm in taking the kingdom from Macbett (Macbeth) at the end of the play. In the 2006 modern dress film adaptation, set among gangsters in Melbourne, Fleance (Craig Stott) is depicted as a teenage boy, looking slightly older than in the original play. He also appears a bit more often, mainly in the scenes of Act V, where he sneaks on board a truck full of timber and witnesses the death of Macbeth before killing the maid and being directed home by Macduff. In Joel Coen's 2021 film, Fleance (Lucas Barker) is retrieved from the Old Man (Kathryn Hunter) by (the more prominent than usual) character of Ross (Alex Hassell), who has played an ambiguous role throughout the film.  Influence Fleance's line "The moon is down, I have not heard the clock" was the inspiration for the title of John Steinbeck's 1942 short novel The Moon is Down. Fleance's line foreshadows the evil encompassing the kingdom. The book was published just as the United States entered World War II and signalled the threat of the Axis powers by outlining the events in a European town occupied by foreign powers. Steinbeck's book became a Broadway play and a film. In 2008, Pegasus Books published The Tragedy of Macbeth Part II: The Seed of Banquo, a play by American author and playwright Noah Lukeman that endeavoured to pick up where the original Macbeth left off, and to resolve its many loose ends, particularly the prophesied ascension of the seed of Banquo. Written in blank verse, the play was published to critical acclaim. Another book published in 2009 by Penguin Books, Banquo's Son, is the first in a trilogy that follows on from the Shakespearean story. The novels are written by New Zealand author and English teacher, T.K. Roxborogh.  References   == Bibliography ==

German submarine U-528 was a Type IXC U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. She was laid down at the Deutsche Werft (yard) in Hamburg as yard number 343 on 10 November 1941, launched on 1 July 1942 and commissioned on 16 September with Kapitänleutnant Karl-Heinz Fuchs in command. U-528 began her service career with training as part of the 4th U-boat Flotilla from 16 September 1942. She was reassigned to the 10th flotilla for operations on 1 April 1943. She carried out one patrol but did not sink any ships. She was a member of one wolfpack. She was sunk by a British aircraft and a British warship southwest of Ireland on 11 May 1943.  Design German Type IXC/40 submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IXCs. U-528 had a displacement of 1,144 tonnes (1,126 long tons) when at the surface and 1,257 tonnes (1,237 long tons) while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of 76.76 m (251 ft 10 in), a pressure hull length of 58.75 m (192 ft 9 in), a beam of 6.86 m (22 ft 6 in), a height of 9.60 m (31 ft 6 in), and a draught of 4.67 m (15 ft 4 in). The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of 4,400 metric horsepower (3,240 kW; 4,340 shp) for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of 1,000 shaft horsepower (1,010 PS; 750 kW) for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two 1.92 m (6 ft) propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 230 metres (750 ft). The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 18.3 knots (33.9 km/h; 21.1 mph) and a maximum submerged speed of 7.3 knots (13.5 km/h; 8.4 mph). When submerged, the boat could operate for 63 nautical miles (117 km; 72 mi) at 4 knots (7.4 km/h; 4.6 mph); when surfaced, she could travel 13,850 nautical miles (25,650 km; 15,940 mi) at 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph). U-528 was fitted with six 53.3 cm (21 in) torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one 10.5 cm (4.13 in) SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a 3.7 cm (1.5 in) SK C/30 as well as a 2 cm (0.79 in) C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight.  Service history Patrol and loss The boat departed Kiel on 15 April 1943, moved through the North Sea, negotiated the gap between Iceland and the Faroe Islands and entered the Atlantic Ocean. There, she was intercepted by the escorts of Convoy ON (S) 5 and damaged. She was sunk on her way to the French Atlantic bases. U-528 was 'destroyed' on 11 May 1943 southwest of Ireland by depth charges dropped from a Handley Page Halifax of No. 58 Squadron RAF and the British sloop HMS Fleetwood. Eleven men went down with the U-boat; there were 45 survivors. Among the survivors was Reimar Lüst who later became an astrophysicist.  Wolfpacks U-528 took part in one wolfpack, namely:  Star (27 April – 4 May 1943)  References Bibliography External links Helgason, Guðmundur. "The Type IXC/40 boat U-528".

The Sophie May House is a historic house on Sophie May Lane in Norridgewock, Maine.  Built in 1845, it is an excellent local example of Greek Revival architecture, with a classical four-columned Greek temple front.  The house is most notable as the long-time home of Rebecca Sophia Clarke (1833-1906), who wrote a series of popular children's books under the pen name "Sophie May".  The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.  Description and setting The Sophie May House is set between Sophie May Lane and the Kennebec River to the south, just outside the main village of Norridgewock.   It is a 2+1⁄2-story brick structure, with a front-facing gable roof, which projects beyond the front facade and is supported by four smooth Doric columns, with a fully pedimented flush-boarded gable end above.  The main facade is three bays wide, with full-length windows in the two left bays and the entrance in the rightmost.  The interior follows a typical side-hall plan, with the main parlor to the left, and kitchen and service area in ells attached to the rear of the house. The house was built in 1845 by Cullen Sawtelle, a native son who studied law at Bowdoin College and represented the area in Congress in the 1840s.  In 1848 Sawtelle sold the house to Asa Clarke.  Clarke's daughter, Rebecca, was educated at Norridgewock Female Academy and taught primary school in Illinois until advancing deafness forced her return.  From 1861 until her death in 1906 she lived here, where she wrote more than forty volumes of children's stories, using realistic settings and characterizations drawn in part from her hometown, and in contrast to the prevailing style of didactic and moralizing children's literature.

Frederick Charles Blair, ISO (1874 – May 28, 1959) was the director of the Government of Canada's Immigration Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources from 1936 to 1943. Blair developed and rigorously enforced strict immigration policies based on race and is most remembered for his successful effort to keep Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany out of Canada during the 1930s and the war years that followed. Between 1933 and 1939, Blair's office allowed fewer than 5,000 Jews into Canada, in comparison to over 200,000 allowed into the United States, and 20,000 into Mexico. After the war, between 1945 and 1948, the Immigration Branch accepted only 8,000 Jewish Holocaust survivors. "That record is arguably the worst of all possible refugee-receiving states", wrote Abella and Troper. Blair's rigorous enforcement of anti-Semitic immigration policies sealed the fate of thousands of European Jews who would have escaped death had Canada not turned them away.  Biography Frederick Blair was born 1874 in Carlisle, Ontario, the son of Scottish parents. In 1903 he joined the Department of Agriculture and in 1905 he became an immigration officer. In 1924 he became assistant deputy minister of immigration and in 1936 became the director of the Immigration Branch. He was a church elder and a dedicated civil servant who oversaw every aspect of Canadian immigration. He ruled the Immigration Branch with an iron fist. "He was the single most difficult individual I have had to deal with ... He was a holy terror", James Gibson, an official in the Department of External Affairs told Abella and Troper. Blair was anti-Semitic, as were many among the Canadian elite of the time. Though he couched his public statements and policies in generalized, protectionist language, Blair's letters and private conversations, quoted extensively in None Is Too Many, reveal his distaste for Jews. Blair was the policy's architect and staunch champion for Canada's closed-door policy with the full support of the Liberal Party of Canada government of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King.   In September 1938, in a letter to the prime minister, Blair wrote, "Pressure by Jewish people to get into Canada has never been greater than it is now, and I am glad to be able to add that, after 35 years of experience here, that it has never been so carefully controlled". Representative of Blair's xenophobic and anti-Semitic "careful control" was Canada's refusal in June 1939 to allow the MS St. Louis, the so-called "Voyage of the Damned" to dock in Halifax with 907 Jewish emigrants aboard. After Canada's rejection (following refusals from Cuba and the United States), the St. Louis was forced to return to Europe where, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 254 of the passengers perished at the hands of the Nazis. There is now an exhibit, entitled The Wheel of Conscience in the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21, Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, as a reminder of that event. In his 1941 annual report, Blair wrote "Canada, in accordance with generally accepted practice, places greater emphasis on race than upon citizenship". When he retired in 1943, Frederick Blair was named a Companion of the Imperial Service Order. Blair died on May 28, 1959, at age 84.

The National Junior Classical League (National JCL or NJCL) is a youth organization of secondary school students sponsored by the American Classical League (ACL). Founded in 1936, the NJCL comprises more than 1,000 Latin, Greek and Classical chapters in the United States, Canada, South Korea and the United Kingdom, and with over 45,000 members, is the largest Classical organization in the world today. Its mission is "to encourage an interest in and an appreciation of the language, literature and culture of ancient Greece and Rome and to impart an understanding of the debt of our own culture to that of classical antiquity." NJCL official colors are Roman purple and gold. It sponsors a Latin Honor Society and Greek Honor Society for high school students.  History The idea of creating a junior organization to the American Classical League was first proposed in 1927 at the organization's annual meeting. A committee was appointed to study the matter, but it decided two years later that it wouldn't be worth pursuing at the time. In 1936, a pin was made and lifetime membership cost thirty cents, as it was decided to pursue the creation of a junior organization. The Junior Classical League was announced in November 1936 in Classical Outlook, with headquarters being established at New York University. Today, chapters exist in the United States, Canada, and Australia and has over 50,000 members.  National convention The NJCL hosts a week-long national convention annually at a college campus in late July or early August, where 1200–1500 students compete in academic tests, graphic and creative arts competitions, and meet many classics students from around the country. Other components of the convention in which students may participate include Certamen, a quizbowl-like trivia competition, seminars commonly known as Colloquia, and Ludi (literally "games"—various athletic and recreational events). Students may also campaign for public offices within the NJCL, including President, Treasurer, and Historian. Starting regularly in 1972, every convention is given a motto/theme from Latin poetry or literature. A theme for the following year's convention is chosen by the incoming president each year. Most state-level NJCL chapters hold their own annual conventions at locations central to their attendees, where schools compete in varied events. These events are divided into academic levels for scoring purposes; participation can be countywide, regional, or even statewide. Awards are given out to schools based on sweepstakes points, earned by placing high in competitive events. The 2018 national convention was held at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio from July 23–28. The 2019 national convention was held at North Dakota State University in Fargo, North Dakota from July 26–31. The 2020 national convention was held digitally due to the COVID-19 pandemic from July 24–29.  State chapters As of 2010, forty-seven U.S. states, the District of Columbia, three Canadian provinces, and the United Kingdom each maintain a state (or state-level) chapter of the NJCL; the current total number is 51 as Oregon, Washington state, and British Columbia share a chapter under the moniker Cascadia JCL. Many chapters hold their own annual State Convention in addition to the National Convention.  Publications Torch: U.S. is the NJCL's official publication, which details the events of the organization, reports scores, and issues stories. Published four times a year, the only issue sent to all convention attendees (including non-subscribers) is the fall issue, shortly after convention. Until October 2007, the NJCL also published JCL Highlights in months when the Torch: U.S. was not published. JCL Highlights publicized administrative details about the League, including details about applying for JCL scholarships, information about the upcoming Convention, and requests for information from NJCL officers and national committee members. According to the Fall 2007 Torch: U.S., the National Committee decided at the October 2007 Fall Planning Meeting to eliminate the JCL Highlights in favor of online distribution of the same information. During national conventions, a student published newspaper, The Convention Ear, is produced. The Ear highlights convention events and gives information about candidates for NJCL office.

Khorazm Region, also known as the Khorezm or Xorazm Region, (Uzbek: Xorazm viloyati, Хоразм вилояти, خوارزم ولایتی) is a viloyat (region) of Uzbekistan located in the northwest of the country in the lower reaches of the Amu Darya River. It borders with Turkmenistan, Karakalpakstan, and the Bukhara Region. It covers an area of 6,050 square kilometres (2,340 sq mi). The population is estimated at 1,959,300 (2023), with 67% living in rural areas. The capital is Urgench (pop. est. 147 300). Other major towns include Xonqa, Khiva, Shovot, and Pitnak.  The climate is a typically arid continental climate, with cold winters and extremely hot, dry summers. The city of Khiva in Khorezm Region is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with world-famous architectural monuments, making Khiva one of the main centers for international tourism in the country.  The economy of Khorezm Region is primarily based on cotton.  Cotton is by far the main crop, although rice production has increased significantly in the last several years. (though the Uzbek government discourages rice production near to deserts, over water usage concerns) There are also many orchards and vineyards, melon and gourd plantations and potato fields. Khorezm Region is famous for its "gurvak" melon in Uzbekistan.  Industry is also heavily oriented to cotton, with cotton refining, cottonseed oil extraction and textiles predominating. Khorezm is a place where many famous scholars were born, such as Abu Rayhan Biruni and al-Khwārizmī. The region has a well-developed transportation infrastructure, with over 130 km of railways and 2000 km of surfaced roads. The region is connected by rail to European Russia and the Caucasus. People in Khorezm speak in Khorezmian, which is an Oghuz dialect of Turkic Languages that is different from Karluk (in which most of other Uzbek regions' people speak)  Administrative divisions The Region consists of 11 districts (listed below) and two district-level cities: Urgench and Khiva.  There are 3 cities (Urgench, Khiva, Pitnak) and 56 urban-type settlements in the Khorazm Region. In March 2020 the new Tuproqqalʼa District was created out of the larger, eastern part of Hazorasp District. Gurlen is one of the most unique districts in the region. The most interesting place in Khorezm is Aqdarband village. Ancestors of the people of Aqdarband came from Iran in 15th age to protect Khiva.

The Flip is an album by the jazz saxophonist Hank Mobley recorded on July 12, 1969 in Paris, France, and released on the Blue Note label. It features performances by Mobley with four European-based musicians: trumpeter Dizzy Reece, trombonist Slide Hampton, pianist Vince Benedetti, bassist Alby Cullaz, and drummer Philly Joe Jones.  Reception Allmusic awarded the album 4 stars with review by Thom Jurek saying, "While not as groundbreaking as A Caddy for Daddy, Dippin' or Soul Station, Flip is nonetheless a solid hard groove date for Mobley ... Flip is a very worthwhile side to add to the Mobley shelf". The Guardian's John Fordham called it "Pretty standard Blue Note hard bop, but from an original who doesn't make an exhibition of how original he is" observing "The music has something of a Blue Note usual-suspects quality and Vince Benedetti's metronomic piano comping under the horns can get on your nerves, but the lineup is otherwise strong and the music pretty lively". On All About Jazz Germien Linares stated "An exquisite soul messenger, Mobley was criticized for not being as aggressive, voluminous, or trailblazing as his contemporaries. Indeed, he was not. Instead, his music was steeped in care, precision and nuances. In Mobley's hands, such treatment often dazzled, as on his latest Blue Note reissue, The Flip ... He's supported by an excellent crew of international musicians, ... All the tunes on The Flip were composed by Mobley and are built around his strengths of soul, swing, and subtlety ... True, this album and its composer will never be within the ranks of the most influential, the most revered, or even the most downloaded. Fine. Besides, as a provocateur of beauty, Mobley is in a class all his own". Flophouse magazine noted "In the late sixties Hank Mobley’s round tone had become a bit rougher around the edges and his style was more hard-driving. This is evident on 1969’s The Flip, which boasts hi-voltage blowing but is short on finesse. Mobley, always the prolific songwriter, wrote all five tunes on The Flip. The compositions that turn out best are the ones that resemble Mobley’s songwriting of the late fifties and early sixties. ... The Flip swings hard and is sure to enliven a party. But unfortunately, it also swings wild and uncontrolled, favouring a strained, hi-octane tension over a sophisticated build-up".  Track listing All compositions by Hank Mobley.

Sorted Food is a British YouTube channel and food community created by Benjamin 'Ebbers' Ebbrell, Michael 'Mike' Huttlestone, Jamie 'Spaff' Spafford and Barry 'Baz' Taylor. The YouTube channel was created on March 10, 2010, and has grown a large food and cooking community. They created the Sorted Club (stylized as sorted club), which is a subscription-based collection of apps to "learn, explore and change your routine for the better".  History The Sorted Food YouTube channel was launched in March 2010 by Jamie Spafford, Ben Ebbrell, Barry Taylor, and Mike Huttlestone, who were school friends from Hertfordshire. Around 2014, James Currie, who met Ebbrell in culinary school, joined the team first as a developmental chef and then as an on-camera personality. The channel's recipes are intended to be accessible to a large number of people. This was the idea of Ebbrell, the only original member with any culinary training, who started suggesting simple and cheap recipes for the others to try instead of eating only ready meals. In 2015, the four Sorted Food members went on a three-month USA tour for NBC's Today show. In May 2021, the team announced that Currie would be leaving to take a new job. In June 2021 they announced a new head of food, Kush Bhasin, who had formerly worked as a development chef at Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons under Raymond Blanc, and as an executive sous chef at Benares in Mayfair, London under Atul Kochhar. Starting in 2023, Bhasin has also taken a more on-camera role on the channel.  Current content As of April 2021, the company had 12 employees based in Tower Hill. According to a November 2022 video, the company has grown to 25 employees. Sorted works with a number of brand partners on large-scale sponsored content. Some examples include Visit The USA, Kenwood Kitchen Appliances, Ford, Heinz, Android, and Blizzard. A proportion of their video content centers around travel and destination marketing, using that to unlock new food adventures from locations, cuisines, and cultures less familiar to them.  Publishing The first two Sorted cookbooks, A Recipe for Student Survival and A Rookies Guide to Crackin' Cooking, were self-published in 2008 and 2012 respectively through "Co-Incidence Ventures" and released in both paperback and hardback editions. In 2012 they signed with Penguin Books and released a beginners cookbook, Beginners Get... Sorted, and an eBook, Food with Friends, which is also available in individual chapters. In 2017, the friends created Desserts in Duvets with the aid of a KickStarter campaign, funded by their ever-growing online community. In 2021, the company reprinted and sold copies of Can't be Arsed 1 and 2.  Reach and awards As of 27 October 2023 the YouTube channel had over 2.73 million subscribers and more than 1 billion video views. Sorted Food has gained an influence on social media, with over 187,000 followers on Twitter (as of Jan 2022), over 265,000 followers on Facebook and over 240,000 followers on Instagram. They were listed 4th in The Guardian's "30 Under 30: The Top Young People in Digital Media" in 2014. "Best Online Program - Entertainment Award" 2011 Banff World Media Festival. "New Media Award" 2014 Guild of Food Writers awards. Ebbrell won the Good Food Channel's Market Kitchen search for the "next celebrity chef". "Best Online Content" 2017 UK Blog Awards and were nominated for "Best Series of Videos" for their Game Changers work with the US Tourism Board at the CMAs. Recent press, TV, and radio coverage include: Observer Magazine, Good Morning Britain, Blue Peter, Heat, The Sun, Delicious Magazine, Russell Howard's Christmas special, Radio 2, BBC 5Live, Shortlist, TES, New Business Magazine, and Sky News in the UK. Plus have had regular appearances on America's The TODAY Show.  Books In 2017, they started a book club and publish books every 3 months exclusively to book club members.

Isabella of England (1214 – 1 December 1241) was an English princess of the House of Plantagenet. She became Holy Roman Empress, Queen of Sicily, Italy and Germany from 1235 until her death as the third wife of Emperor Frederick II.  Life Birth and early years Isabella was born around 1214 as the fourth child and second daughter of John, King of England and his second wife Isabella of Angoulême. Her exact date of birth is unknown, and the year is calculated based on the fact that Matthew Paris reported that the princess got married at the age of 21. By the time Isabella was born, her parents' marriage had already started to unravel, and the princess spent most of the time with her mother. After the death of King John in 1216, Isabella remained in the full care of her mother and was with her until 1220, when Isabella of Angouleme remarried and left the English court. The princess was raised from an early age by the "nurse and governess" Margaret Biset, who received for her services from 1219, by order of her brother King Henry III, one penny a day "from the hands of the Viscount Hereford"; she remained within Isabella's household and accompanied her to Germany sixteen years later, when the princess married. The services of the rest of the princess's servants (cook, stableman and others) were also paid by her brother, and by his order, when some of Isabella's servants retired from her service, they were assigned a generous pension. The first years of Isabella's life were spent in Gloucester Castle. Later, when the problems that accompanied the early years of her brother's reign ended, she was transported to the court, at first located at Woodstock Palace in Oxfordshire and later at Westminster. From time to time, the princess with her family visited other royal residences: Winchester, Marlborough, Northampton, York and others.  Youth In June 1220 or 1221 Isabella's older sister, Joan, was betrothed to King Alexander II of Scotland, and according to the marriage contract, if Joan did not have time to return to England by Michael's Day (29 September), within two weeks after that, the Scottish King was to marry Isabella. Twice over the next ten years, King Henry III tried to marry off his sister (probably Isabella): first, in 1225, were negotiations for a marriage with King Henry (VII) of Germany (who ten years later became Isabella's stepson) and then to King Louis IX of France. Once the princess got older, the more she loved privacy. In November 1229, with the permission of her brother, she departed for Marlborough Castle, which became her residence; at this time, reconstruction was being completed in the castle, and King Henry III ordered the constable of the castle to allow his sister to choose any quarters she wanted. The relationship between brother and sister was very warm, and the King visited Isabella several times: he visited Marlborough during the celebration of the wedding of "the maiden Catherine" who served Isabella, and also visited his sister in 1231 and 1232 at Gloucester Castle. On 13 November 1232, King Henry III sent his personal tailor to his sister to make her a new full wardrobe. The King also celebrated Christmas with Isabella that year; he sent her three of the best dishes from his table and presented many gifts, and then for several months he sent her the items needed to equip the princess's own chapel. Provisions for Isabella and her guests were provided by "two or three worthy men" from Gloucester, while wine and venison were regularly sent to his sister by the King, who also provided one of his fish suppliers for use by Isabella. The royal chaplain, Warin, who served Isabella, was also granted to his sister by the King. In the summer of 1232, Isabella returned to Marlborough Castle.  Marriage In 1234, Isabella left seclusion and settled in the Tower of London. In November, the twice-widowed Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor at a friendly meeting at Rieti, received the advice of Pope Gregory IX to ask Isabella's hand, and in February 1235 he sent an embassy to King Henry III headed by his chancellor Pietro della Vigna. The marriage of Isabella and Emperor Frederick II was designed to strengthen the political alliance of England and the Holy Roman Empire against France. After three days of discussion, King Henry III agreed to the marriage; Isabella was brought from her quarters in the Tower to the Palace of Westminster, where she met with the ambassadors, who "declared her the most worthy of the imperial brides", put a wedding ring on her finger and greeted her as their Empress. On 22 February 1235, an agreement was signed, according to which King Henry III provided his sister with a dowry of 30,000 marks (an amount sought by the Emperor in order to fund his wars in northern Italy), which was to be paid within two years, and as a wedding gift he gave her all the necessary utensils, jewelry, horses and rich clothes, all made according to the latest German fashion; also, the princess received patent letters from the Emperor, giving Isabella, as Queen of Sicily and Holy Roman Empress the possession of the lands due to her. On 27 February both parties signed the marriage contract: the marriage of the English princess with the Holy Roman Emperor was greeted with enthusiasm by both King Henry III and by the common people, although the latter were greatly disappointed by the enormous "help" required of them on this occasion: the King had to levy an unpopular tax of two marks of silver per hide in order to afford Isabella's dowry. In early May 1235, Archbishop Heinrich I of Cologne and Duke Henry I of Brabant arrived in England to fetch the bride to her new homeland; Isabella departed from London on 7 May under the care and tutelage of the Bishop of Exeter, William Briwere. The princess's brothers accompanied her from Canterbury to Sandwich, from where Isabella sailed on 11 May; four days later they landed at Antwerp. Before Isabella's departure from England, the Emperor's ambassadors swore to King Henry III that if the Emperor died before marriage to the princess could be completed, she would return home without hindrance and in complete safety. It was rumored that on the way, the Emperor's enemies, allied with the French king, tried to kidnap Isabella, but the escort provided by Emperor Frederick II was able to protect the princess. In 22 or 24 May, Isabella arrived in Cologne and stayed at the house of provost of St. Gereon, where the princess had to spend six weeks, while the Emperor was at war with his own son.  Empress After a six-week wait, Emperor Frederick II summoned his bride to Worms, where their official wedding took place and Isabella was crowned at Worms Cathedral by Archbishop Siegfried III of Mainz. Researchers disagree on the date of this double event: Alison Weir and Mary Anne Everett Green date it 20 July 1235; Kate Norgate, author of the article on Isabella in the Dictionary of National Biography, writes about Sunday 15 July, while James Panton lists both dates as possible. Wedding celebrations lasted for four days, and, as they say, they attended "four kings, eleven dukes, counts and margraves, thirty or fewer prelates and minor nobles". On 14 August, Emperor Frederick II called an assembly to which representatives from all over the Empire were invited; they met the new empress and brought her their congratulations. Isabella (or Elizabeth, as some of her husband's subjects called her) seems to have been a very dignified and beautiful woman. Frederick was delighted with his new wife, but immediately after the wedding he got rid of Isabella's English entourage "of both sexes", leaving only her nurse Margaret Biset and one maid with her, and transferred her to seclusion in Hagenau, where the couple spent most of the winter. Earlier, the English embassy, which arrived with Isabella, left for their homeland; they brought gifts to their king from the emperor, among whom were three living leopards —animals depicted on the coat of arms of the English king. Soon after the wedding, Emperor Frederick II was forced to leave and leave his wife in the care of his son Conrad. In early 1236, Isabella and her husband visited Ravenna; part of the year the imperial couple spent in Italy, after which they returned to Germany. Already being married, Isabella continued to maintain a relationship with her brother King Henry III: they maintained a regular correspondence, in which they communicated as warmly as strict etiquette allowed. Warm correspondence with the English king was conducted by the Emperor himself, but the name of his wife was mentioned in these letters occasionally and only regarding political issues. In July, Emperor Frederick II was preparing for a military campaign and was forced to leave his wife in Germany for almost a year. By Michael's Day, Emperor Frederick II returned to Lombardy, where he summoned his wife and where he spent the winter with her. In September 1238, the emperor sent his wife to Andria, where Isabella remained until December, when the archbishop of Palermo escorted her back to Lombardy. In early 1239, Isabella spent some time in Noventa Padovana while her husband was in Padua; in February 1240 she returned to southern Italy, where the emperor soon arrived. Emperor Frederick II, it seems, respected and loved his wife, but in a quite strange manner: taking care of her safety and surrounding her with luxury and splendor, but keeping at a distance from himself and in company of his "harem", which included women from Arabia; in addition, James Panton writes that the empress was forbidden to communicate with all men, except for the black eunuchs around her. Isabella's brother King Henry III complained that his sister was never allowed to "wear her crown" publicly or appear as empress at public meetings. In 1241, when her second brother, Richard of Cornwall, went to visit Frederick on his way back from the Holy Land, only “after a few days” he was able “with the permission of the emperor and of his own free will” to visit his sister's chambers. Frederick did not allow Isabella to meet her brother at court. Isabella died in childbirth at Foggia near Naples in 1241. Alison Weir dated Isabella's death between 1–6 December. While Kate Norgate and Mary Anne Everett Green believe that she died on 1 December. Frederick II at the time of his wife's death was in Faenza, and Isabella's dying words were a request to her husband to continue to maintain friendly relations with her brother King Henry III. Isabella was buried with full honors at Andria Cathedral near Bari beside Frederick's previous wife, Queen Isabella II of Jerusalem. King Henry III was deeply saddened and shocked by his sister's death. He ordered his almoner to distribute, "for the soul of the empress, our late sister," over £200 in alms at Oxford and Ospringe; the same amount was distributed in London and Windsor. Matthew Paris lamented the death of Isabella, calling her "the glory and hope of England".  Issue Sources are at variance concerning Isabella's issue, including the number of children she had, their names, and their birth order:  Kate Norgate names three children: Margaret (February 1237 – 1270), Henry (18 February 1238 - 1254) and a child who died in childbirth in December 1241. Later researchers mentioned as the first child of Isabella a son called Jordanus (b. 1236), but Norgate believes that contemporary sources of Isabella do not confirm this; moreover, the Emperor announced the birth of Margaret to his Italian subjects, from which it follows that she was the first child of the couple. Norgate writes that Henry, after the death of his father, became the titular king of Jerusalem, and Margaret was married to Albert II, Margrave of Meissen, and became in one of the ancestors of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Alison Weir names four children: Jordanus (born and died in 1236), Agnes (born and died in 1237), Henry (titular king of Jerusalem; 1238 - 1253) and Margaret (wife of the Landgrave Albert II of Thuringia; 1241-1270). Weir wrote about Isabella's death in childbirth, but does not report what happened to the child; perhaps this child was Margaret —and this belief is the most commonly accepted among websites and genealogical investigations. Mary-Anne Everett Green also names four children: Jordanus (born and died in 1236), Agnes (born and died in 1237), Henry (born 18 February 1238) and Margaret (born 1 December 1241). James Panton writes about Isabella's giving birth to four or five children, but does not mention their names.

Diabetic nephropathy, also known as diabetic kidney disease, is the chronic loss of kidney function occurring in those with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic nephropathy is the leading causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) globally. The triad of protein leaking into the urine (proteinuria or albuminuria), rising blood pressure with hypertension and then falling renal function is common to many forms of CKD. Protein loss in the urine due to damage of the glomeruli may become massive, and cause a low serum albumin with resulting generalized body swelling (edema) so called nephrotic syndrome. Likewise, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may progressively fall from a normal of over 90 ml/min/1.73m2 to less than 15, at which point the patient is said to have end-stage renal disease. It usually is slowly progressive over years. Pathophysiologic abnormalities in diabetic nephropathy usually begin with long-standing poorly controlled blood glucose levels. This is followed by multiple changes in the filtration units of the kidneys, the nephrons. (There are normally about 750,000–1.5 million nephrons in each adult kidney). Initially, there is constriction of the efferent arterioles and dilation of afferent arterioles, with resulting glomerular capillary hypertension and hyperfiltration particularly as nephrons become obsolescent and the adaption of hyperfiltration paradoxically causes further shear stress related damage to the delicate glomerular capillaries, further proteinuria, rising blood pressure and a vicious circle of additional nephron damage and decline in overall renal function. Concurrently, there are changes within the glomerulus itself: these include a thickening of the basement membrane, a widening of the slit membranes of the podocytes, an increase in the number of mesangial cells, and an increase in mesangial matrix. This matrix invades the glomerular capillaries and produces deposits called Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules. The mesangial cells and matrix can progressively expand and consume the entire glomerulus, shutting off filtration. The status of diabetic nephropathy may be monitored by measuring two values: the amount of protein in the urine - proteinuria; and a blood test called the serum creatinine. The amount of the proteinuria reflects the degree of damage to any still-functioning glomeruli. The value of the serum creatinine can be used to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which reflects the percentage of glomeruli which are no longer filtering the blood.  Treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, which dilates the arteriole exiting the glomerulus, thus reducing the blood pressure within the glomerular capillaries, may slow (but not stop) progression of the disease. Three classes of diabetes medications – GLP-1 agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors– are also thought to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease and is a serious complication that affects approximately one quarter of adults with diabetes in the United States. Affected individuals with end-stage kidney disease often require hemodialysis and eventually kidney transplantation to replace the failed kidney function. Diabetic nephropathy is associated with an increased risk of death in general, particularly from cardiovascular disease.  Signs and symptoms The onset of symptoms is 5 to 10 years after the disease begins. A usual first symptom is frequent urination at night: nocturia. Other symptoms include tiredness, headaches, a general feeling of illness, nausea, vomiting, frequent daytime urination, lack of appetite, itchy skin, and leg swelling. The clinical presentation of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is characterized by proteinuria (protein in the urine), hypertension and progressive loss of kidney function. The process may be initially indolent, making regular screening for diabetic nephropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus of great importance.  Risk factors Not all patients with diabetes go on to develop diabetic nephropathy. The main risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing diabetic nephropathy are:  Poor control of blood glucose Uncontrolled high blood pressure Type 1 diabetes mellitus, with onset before age 20 Past or current cigarette use A family history of diabetic nephropathy- certain genes have been identified that are associated with DN. ( However, no direct correlation has been established yet. One of these genes is APOL1, which has been found to be associated with nephropathy in African American individuals.) Certain racial groups (African Americans, Mexican Americans, and Pima Indians are at higher risk).  Pathophysiology The disease progression of diabetic nephropathy involves various clinical stages: hyperfiltration, microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, nephrotic proteinuria to progressive chronic kidney disease leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The damage is exerted on all compartments of the kidney: the glomerulus, the renal tubules, the vasculature (afferent and efferent renal arterioles) and the interstitium. Renal fibrosis is the final common pathway of DN. This fibrosis is a product of multiple mechanisms including renal hemodynamic changes, glucose metabolism abnormalities associated with oxidative stress as well as inflammatory processes and an overactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy is thought to involve an interaction between hemodynamic and metabolic factors. Hemodynamic factors include an increase in systemic and intraglomerular pressure, as well as the over-activation of the RAAS. Studies have shown that in the setting of diabetes, various factors stimulate the RAAS, which is one of the most important pathways in diabetic nephropathy pathophysiology. Due to the higher load of filtered glucose, there is an up-regulation in the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal tubules, which cotransports sodium and glucose back into circulation. This leads to a decrease in the delivery of sodium chloride to the macula densa in the distal tubules, promoting the release of renin and over-activating RAAS. Hyperfiltration is one of the earliest features of DN. Several mechanisms have been proposed to cause hyperfiltration. One of these mechanisms is that as glomeruli becomes hypertrophied, filtration surface area initially increases. Another possible mechanism is that abnormal vascular control in diabetic nephropathy leads to a reduction in afferent glomerular arteriolar resistance and an increase in efferent glomerular arteriolar resistance, leading to a net increase in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Glomerular hyperfiltration and an aberrant regulation of RAAS lead to increased intraglomerular pressure, causing stress on the endothelial cells, the mesangial cells and the podocytes. This exacerbates the dysfunction caused by the metabolic effects of hyperglycemia. Metabolic factors include the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which have a central role in the pathophysiology of many of the complications of diabetes mellitus, including cardiovascular complications. AGEs are chemical groups that form when a reducing sugar (glucose in this case) reacts non-enzymatically with an amine group, predominantly lysine and arginine, which are attached on proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. These glycation products accumulate on the proteins of vessel wall collagen, forming an irreversible complex of cross-linked AGEs. An important way AGEs exert their effect is through a receptor-mediated mechanism, most importantly by the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). RAGE is a signal transduction receptor found on a number of cell types including macrophages, endothelial cells, renal mesangial cells and podocytes in the glomerulus. Bindings of AGEs to RAGE receptors enhances production of cytosolic Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) as well as stimulates intracellular molecules such as Protein Kinase C (PKC), NF-κB and the activation of growth factors TGF-B and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These factors, along with the hemodynamic changes that occur, lead to podocyte injury, oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis. As injury worsens, kidney function decreases and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) become more permeable and less efficient at filtration. This is accompanied by a steady decline in kidney function.  Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on the measurement of abnormal levels of urinary albumin in an individual with diabetes  coupled with exclusion of other causes of albuminuria. Albumin measurements are defined as follows:  Normal albuminuria: urinary albumin excretion <30 mg/24h; Microalbuminuria: urinary albumin excretion in the range of 30–299 mg/24h; Macroalbuminuria: urinary albumin excretion ≥300 mg/24h Urinary albumin excretion can also be measured by urinary albumin/creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample, which is as accurate but more convenient than a 24-hour urine collection. It is recommended that individuals with diabetes have their albumin levels checked annually, beginning immediately after a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and five years after a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Medical imaging of the kidneys, generally by ultrasonography, is recommended as part of a differential diagnosis if there is suspicion of urinary tract obstruction, urinary tract infection, kidney stones or polycystic kidney disease. Conformation kidney biopsy should only be performed if non-diabetic kidney disease is suspected. Urine analysis in patients with diabetic kidney disease is often bland. In cases of severely increased microalbuminuria, hematuria might be present. fat bodies might be present in patients who develop nephrotic-range proteinuria.  Staging To clinically stage the degree of damage in this (and any) kidney disease, the serum creatinine is determined and used to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Normal eGFR is equal to or greater than 90ml/min/1.73 m2. On biopsy, the following classification has been suggested by Tervaert et al.:  Biomarkers Although albuminuria is the most frequently used marker of DN, it has a limited sensitivity as many patients with diabetic nephropathy experience GFR loss and glomerulosclerosis without immediate elevation in albuminuria. Many novel markers are currently being studied that potentially detect diabetic nephropathy at earlier stages and identify progression risk. Cystatin C is a protein that is freely filtered in the glomeruli before it is reabsorbed and catabolized in the renal tubular cells. Its serum level is independent of muscle mass, making more accurate at estimating GFR than creatinine serum levels.  Treatment The goals of treatment are to slow the progression of kidney damage and control related complications. Management of diabetic nephropathy currently centers over four main areas: Cardiovascular risk reduction, glycemic control, blood pressure control as well as inhibition of the RAAS system. Cardiovascular risk reduction: Patients with diabetes mellitus are at significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which is also an independent risk factor for kidney failure. Therefore, it is important to aggressively manage cardiovascular risk factors in patients with diabetes mellitus and in particular those with diabetic nephropathy. The main components of managing cardiovascular disease is with tobacco cessation, lipid-lowering therapies (e.g., statins) as well as regular exercise and healthy eating. In patients with kidney disease, atorvastatin is preferred over other statins as it does not require dose-adjustment based on GFR. Glycemic control: Multiple studies have found a positive effect of improved glycemic control on clinical outcomes of patients with diabetic nephropathy. Intensive glycemic control also reduces the rate of other DM complications, such as retinopathy and neuropathy. Glycemic control is maintained mainly with insulin in patients with Type 1 DM and with hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin in patients with type 2 DM. Studies showed a decrease in microvascular complications of diabetic nephropathy with a target goal HbA1c concentration of 7%. Further reduction in the HbA1c did not correlate with better outcomes and is thus not recommended in most patients as it could increase the risk of hypoglycemic episodes. Blood pressure control: Multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated a benefit of decreasing systolic blood pressure to <140 mmHg in patients with diabetic nephropathy. High blood pressure is associated with accelerated development of microalbuminuria, over proteinuria and declining kidney function. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, as well as angiotensin II receptor blockers, are particularly helpful in patients with diabetes to lower blood pressure and slow the progression of nephropathy. More intensive blood pressure lower (125-130/<80) in patients with diabetic mellitus has been shown to decrease the risk of progression of diabetic nephropathy as well as other diabetic complications. Some patients might require dual therapy to adequately control pressure, in which case calcium channel blockers or diuretics are a good second-line option. RAAS inhibition: Inhibition can be achieved with multiple therapies, mainly ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid antagonists. RAAS inhibition has been proven to be the most effective therapy to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy in all stages. Although RAAS blockade using more than one agent may further reduce proteinuria, the risk of adverse events (such as hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury) outweigh the potential benefits. Therefore, it is recommended that only one agent is used in patients with DM who have hypertension or any signs of microalbuminuria or diabetic nephropathy. About half of insulin is metabolized and cleared by the kidneys. This means that as kidney function worsens in the setting of DN, some patients with insulin-dependent DM may find that their regular insulin doses are lasting longer than normal, or that they are experiencing an increasing frequency of hypoglycemic episodes. It is also crucial to closely monitor kidney function to properly dose medications that are cleared by the kidneys. Some of the most commonly used nephrotoxic medications are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen. With worsening kidney function, it might also be necessary to follow a renal-diet to avoid complications such as hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. Some evidence suggests that limiting dietary protein could slow the progression of DN, but further evidence is needed to confirm this benefit. Patients with diabetic nephropathy might go on to develop end stage renal disease and require kidney transplantation or hemodialysis.  Emerging therapies A relatively new medication that has been approved for treatment for DM is sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. The mechanism of action of this drug is to the sodium-glucose uptake cotransporter in the proximal tubule, thereby generating naturesis and glucosuria. In multiple clinical trials, SGLT2 inhibitors showed improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients with DM as well a positive effect on kidney outcomes, mainly a reduction in albuminuria and progression of renal damage. Other classes of diabetic medications that have been shown to have a positive effect on the progression of diabetic nephropathy are GLP-1 agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors.  Education and self-management The success of diabetic nephropathy management depends greatly upon the ability of individuals to self-manage this condition, encompassing glycaemic control, and the adoption of healthy lifestyles. Appropriate self-management often requires patient education and behavioural counselling. However, there is still insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the effects, regarding both benefits and harms, of educational programmes for people with diabetic nephropathy. Further high-quality studies are warranted.  Prognosis Diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes can be more difficult to predict because the onset of diabetes is not usually well established. Without intervention, 20–40 percent of patients with type 2 diabetes/microalbuminuria, will evolve to macroalbuminuria. Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease, which may require hemodialysis or even kidney transplantation. It is associated with an increased risk of death in general, particularly from cardiovascular disease.  Epidemiology Diabetic nephropathy affects approximately a third of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetic nephropathy is responsible for about a third of cases of ESRD worldwide, and an even larger fraction in the developed countries. Worldwide, the prevalence of diabetes is projected to increase from 382 million in 2013, to over 592 million by 2035. This increase is projected to be sharpest in developed countries. The prevalence of type 2 DM is particularly increasing due to the rising prevalence of obesity worldwide. Diabetic kidney disease progression could lead to ESRD as well as an increased risk of cardiovascular complications, all of which cause a substantial economic burden. The estimated cost of management of patients with ESRD due to diabetic nephropathy in the US is US$39.35 billion in 2010. Within developed countries, certain ethnic groups such as African Americans and Native Americans are at higher risk of developing diabetic nephropathy and ESRD.

The 2003–04 UEFA Champions League was the 12th season of UEFA's premier European club football tournament, the UEFA Champions League, since its rebranding from the European Cup in 1992, and the 49th tournament overall. This was the first UEFA Champions League edition to feature a new format with a 16-team knockout round instead of a second group stage. The competition was won by Portugal's Porto, who defeated Monaco of France 3–0 at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. This was Portugal's first win since 1987, and Porto's second European trophy in two years, following their UEFA Cup success from the previous season. This was the second consecutive victory in a European cup for Porto coach José Mourinho, who beat Monaco coached by Didier Deschamps, a two-time winner of the competition as a player. AC Milan were the defending champions, but were eliminated by Deportivo de La Coruña in the quarter-finals.  Qualification A total of 72 teams from 48 UEFA member associations participated in the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League. Liechtenstein (who does not have their own domestic league) as well as Andorra and San Marino did not participate. Also not admitted was Azerbaijan, which was suspended by UEFA. Each association enters a certain number of clubs to the Champions League based on its league  coefficient; associations with a higher league coefficient may enter more clubs than associations with a lower league coefficient, but no association may enter more than four teams.  Associations 1–3 each have four teams qualify. Associations 4–6 each have three teams qualify. Associations 7–15 each have two teams qualify. Associations 16–52 (except Azerbaijan, Liechtenstein, Andorra and San Marino) each have one team qualify.  Association ranking For the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League, the associations are allocated places according to their 2002 UEFA country coefficients, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 1997–98 to 2001–02.  Distribution Since the title holders (Milan) also qualified for the Champions League Third qualifying round through their domestic league, one Third qualifying round spot was vacated. Due to this, as well as due to suspension of Azerbaijan, the following changes to the default access list are made:  The champions of association 16 (Switzerland) are promoted from the second qualifying round to the third qualifying round. The champions of associations 26, 27 and 28 (Romania, Hungary and Slovenia) are promoted from the first qualifying round to the second qualifying round.  Teams League positions of the previous season shown in parentheses (TH: Champions League title holders).

The rood screen (also choir screen, chancel screen, or jubé) is a common feature in late medieval church architecture. It is typically an ornate partition between the chancel and nave, of more or less open tracery constructed of wood, stone, or wrought iron. The rood screen was originally surmounted by a rood loft carrying the Great Rood, a sculptural representation of the Crucifixion. In English, Scottish, and Welsh cathedrals, monastic, and collegiate churches, there were commonly two transverse screens, with a rood screen or rood beam located one bay west of the pulpitum screen, but this double arrangement nowhere survives complete, and accordingly the preserved pulpitum in such churches is sometimes referred to as a rood screen. At Wells Cathedral the medieval arrangement was restored in the 20th century, with the medieval strainer arch supporting a rood, placed in front of the pulpitum and organ. Rood screens can be found in churches in many parts of Europe; however, in Catholic countries they were generally removed during the Counter-Reformation, when the retention of any visual barrier between the laity and the high altar was widely seen as inconsistent with the decrees of the Council of Trent. Accordingly, rood screens now survive in much greater numbers in Anglican and Lutheran churches; with the greatest number of survivals complete with screen and rood figures in Scandinavia. The iconostasis in Eastern Christian churches is a visually similar barrier, but is now generally considered to have a different origin, deriving from the ancient altar screen or templon.  Description and origin of the name The word rood is derived from the Saxon word rood or rode, meaning "cross". The rood screen is so called because it was surmounted by the Rood itself, a large figure of the crucified Christ. Commonly, to either side of the Rood, there stood supporting statues of saints, normally Mary and St John, in an arrangement comparable to the Deesis always found in the centre of an Orthodox iconostasis (which uses John the Baptist instead of the Apostle, and a Pantokrator instead of a Crucifixion). Latterly in England and Wales the Rood tended to rise above a narrow loft (called the "rood loft"), which could occasionally be substantial enough to be used as a singing gallery (and might even contain an altar); but whose main purpose was to hold candles to light the rood itself. The panels and uprights of the screen did not support the loft, which instead rested on a substantial transverse beam called the "rood beam" or "candle beam". Access was via a narrow rood stair set into the piers supporting the chancel arch. In parish churches, the space between the rood beam and the chancel arch was commonly filled by a boarded or lath and plaster tympanum, set immediately behind the rood figures and painted with a representation of the Last Judgement. The roof panels of the first bay of the nave were commonly richly decorated to form a celure or canopy of honour; or otherwise there might be a separate celure canopy attached to the front of the chancel arch. The carving or construction of the rood screen often included latticework, which makes it possible to see through the screen partially from the nave into the chancel. The term "chancel" itself derives from the Latin word cancelli meaning "lattice"; a term which had long been applied to the low metalwork or stone screens that delineate the choir enclosure in early medieval Italian cathedrals and major churches. The passage through the rood screen was fitted with doors, which were kept locked except during services. The terms pulpitum, Lettner, jubé and doksaal all suggest a screen platform used for readings from scripture, and there is plentiful documentary evidence for this practice in major churches in Europe in the 16th century. From this it was concluded by Victorian liturgists that the specification ad pulpitum for the location for Gospel lections in the rubrics of the Use of Sarum referred both to the cathedral pulpitum screen and the parish rood loft. However, rood stairs in English parish churches are rarely, if ever, found to have been built wide enough to accommodate the Gospel procession required in the Sarum Use. The specific functions of the late medieval parish rood loft, over and above supporting the rood and its lights, remain an issue of conjecture and debate. In this respect it may be significant that, although there are terms for a rood screen in the vernacular languages of Europe, there is no counterpart specific term in liturgical Latin. Nor does the 13th century liturgical commentator Durandus refer directly to rood screens or rood lofts. This is consistent with the ritual uses of rood lofts being substantially a late medieval development.  History Early medieval altar screens and chancel screens Until the 6th century the altar of Christian churches would have been in full view of the congregation, separated only by a low altar rail around it. Large churches had a ciborium, or canopy on four columns, over the altar, from which hung altar curtains which were closed at certain points in the liturgy. Then, however, following the example of the church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, churches began to surround their altars with a colonnade or templon which supported a decorated architrave beam along which a curtain could be drawn to veil the altar at specific points in the consecration of the Eucharist; and this altar screen, with widely spaced columns, subsequently became standard in the major churches of Rome. In Rome the ritual choir tended to be located west of the altar screen, and this choir area was also surrounded by cancelli, or low chancel screens. These arrangements still survive in the Roman basilicas of San Clemente and Santa Maria in Cosmedin, as well as St Mark's Basilica in Venice. In the Eastern Church, the templon and its associated curtains and decorations evolved into the modern iconostasis. In the Western Church, the cancelli screens of the ritual choir developed into the choir stalls and pulpitum screen of major cathedral and monastic churches; but the colonnaded altar screen was superseded from the 10th century onwards, when the practice developed of raising a canopy or baldacchino, carrying veiling curtains, over the altar itself. Many churches in Ireland and Scotland in the early Middle Ages were very small which may have served the same function as a rood screen. Contemporary sources suggest that the faithful may have remained outside the church for most of the mass; the priest would go outside for the first part of the mass including the reading of the gospel, and return inside the church, out of sight of the faithful, to consecrate the Eucharist.  Churches built in England in the 7th and 8th centuries consciously copied Roman practices; remains indicating early cancelli screens have been found in the monastic churches of Jarrow and Monkwearmouth, while the churches of the monasteries of Brixworth, Reculver and St Pancras Canterbury have been found to have had arcaded colonnades corresponding to the Roman altar screen, and it may be presumed that these too were equipped with curtains. Equivalent arcaded colonnades also survive in 10th-century monastic churches in Spain, such as San Miguel de Escalada. Some 19th-century liturgists supposed that these early altar screens might have represented the origins of the medieval rood screens; but this view is rejected by most current scholars, who emphasize that these screens were intended to separate the altar from the ritual choir, whereas the medieval rood screen separated the ritual choir from the lay congregation.  Great Rood The Great Rood or Rood cross itself long preceded the development of screen lofts, originally being either just hung from the chancel arch or also supported by a plain beam across the arch, and high up, typically at the level of the capitals of the columns (if there are any), or near the point where the arch begins to lean inwards. Numerous near life-size crucifixes survive from the Romanesque period or earlier, with the Gero Cross in Cologne Cathedral (965–970) and the Volto Santo of Lucca the best known. Such crosses are commonly referred to in German as Triumphkreuz or triumphal cross. The prototype may have been one known to have been set up in Charlemagne's Palatine Chapel at Aachen, apparently in gold foil worked over a wooden core in the manner of the Golden Madonna of Essen. The original location and support for the surviving figures is often not clear  many are now hung on walls- but a number of northern European churches, especially in Germany and Scandinavia, preserve the original setting in full – they are known as a "Triumphkreutz" in German, from the "triumphal arch" (chancel arch in later terms) of Early Christian architecture. As in later examples a Virgin and Saint John often flanked the cross, and cherubim and other figures are sometimes seen.  Parochial rood screens For most of the medieval period, there would have been no fixed screen or barrier separating the congregational space from the altar space in parish churches in the Latin West; although as noted above, a curtain might be drawn across the altar at specific points in the Mass. Following the exposition of the doctrine of transubstantiation at the fourth Lateran Council of 1215, clergy were required to ensure that the reserved sacrament was to be kept protected from irreverent access or abuse; and accordingly some form of permanent screen came to be seen as essential, as the parish nave was commonly kept open and used for a wide range of secular purposes. Hence the origin of the chancel screen was independent of the Great Rood; indeed most surviving early screens lack lofts, and do not appear ever to have had a rood cross mounted on them. Nevertheless, over time, the rood beam and its sculptures tended to become incorporated into the chancel screen in new or reworked churches. Over the succeeding three centuries, and especially in the latter period when it became standard for the screen to be topped by a rood loft facing the congregation, a range of local ritual practices developed which incorporated the rood and loft into the performance of the liturgy; especially in the Use of Sarum, the form of the missal that was most common in England. For example, during the 40 days of "Lent" the rood in England was obscured by the Lenten Veil, a large hanging suspended by stays from hooks set into the chancel arch; in such a way that it could be dropped abruptly to the ground on Palm Sunday, at the reading of Matthew 27:51 when the Veil of the Temple is torn asunder.  Monastic rood screens The provisions of the Lateran Council had less effect on monastic churches and cathedrals in England; as these would have already been fitted with two transverse screens; a pulpitum screen separating off the ritual choir; and an additional rood screen one bay further west, delineating the area of the nave provided for lay worship (or in monastic churches of the Cistercian order, delineating the distinct church area reserved for the worship of lay brothers). The monastic rood screen invariably had a nave altar set against its western face, which, from at least the late 11th century onwards, was commonly dedicated to the Holy Cross; as for example in Norwich Cathedral, and in Castle Acre Priory. In the later medieval period many monastic churches erected an additional transverse parclose screen, or fence screen, to the west of the nave altar; an example of which survives as the chancel screen in Dunstable Priory in Bedfordshire. Hence the Rites of Durham, a detailed account of the liturgical arrangements of Durham Cathedral Priory before the Reformation, describes three transverse screens; fence screen, rood screen and pulpitum. and the triple same arrangement is also documented in the collegiate church of Ottery St Mary. In the rest of Europe, this multiple screen arrangement was only found in Cistercian churches, as at Maulbronn Monastery in southern Germany, but many other major churches, such as Albi Cathedral in France, inserted transverse screens in the later medieval period, or reconstructed existing choir screens on a greatly increased scale. In Italy, massive rood screens incorporating an ambo or pulpit facing the nave appear to have been universal in the churches of friars; but not in parish churches, there being no equivalent in the Roman Missal for the ritual elaborations of the Use of Sarum.  The screen and Tridentine worship The decrees of the Council of Trent (1545–1563) enjoined that the celebration of the Mass should be made much more accessible to lay worshippers; and this was widely interpreted as requiring the removal of rood screens as physical and visual barriers, even though the council had made no explicit condemnation of screens. Already in 1565, Duke Cosimo de' Medici ordered the removal of the tramezzi from the Florentine friary churches of Santa Croce and Santa Maria Novella in accordance with the principles of the council. In 1577 Carlo Borromeo published Instructionum Fabricae et Sellectilis Ecclesiasticae libri duo, making no mention of the screen and emphasizing the importance of making the high altar visible to all worshippers; and in 1584 the Church of the Gesù was built in Rome as a demonstration of the new principles of Tridentine worship, having an altar rail but conspicuously lacking either a central rood or screen. Almost all medieval churches in Italy were subsequently re-ordered following this model; and most screens that impeded the view of the altar were removed, or their screening effect reduced, in other Catholic countries, with exceptions like Toledo Cathedral, Albi Cathedral, the church of Brou in Bourg-en-Bresse; and also in monasteries and convents, where the screen was preserved to maintain the enclosure. In Catholic Europe, parochial rood screens survive in substantial numbers only in Brittany, such as those at Plouvorn, Morbihan and Ploubezre .  Symbolic significance The rood screen was a physical and symbolic barrier, separating the chancel, the domain of the clergy, from the nave where lay people gathered to worship. It was also a means of seeing; often it was solid only to waist height and richly decorated with pictures of saints and angels. Concealment and revelation were part of the mediaeval Mass. When kneeling, the congregation could not see the priest, but might do so through the upper part of the screen, when he elevated the Host on Sundays. In some churches, 'squints' (holes in the screen) would ensure that everyone could see the elevation, as seeing the bread made flesh was significant for the congregation. Moreover, while Sunday Masses were very important, there were also weekday services which were celebrated at secondary altars in front of the screen (such as the "Jesus altar", erected for the worship of the Holy Name, a popular devotion in mediaeval times) which thus became the backdrop to the celebration of the Mass. The Rood itself provided a focus for worship according to the medieval Use of Sarum, most especially in Holy Week, when worship was highly elaborate. During Lent the Rood was veiled; on Palm Sunday it was revealed before the procession of palms and the congregation knelt before it. The whole Passion story would then be read from the Rood loft, at the foot of the crucifix by three priests. In the 1400s the rood screen in Dovercourt, UK, became a shrine when it gained a reputation for speaking.  Post-Reformation, in England At the Reformation, the Reformers sought to destroy abused images, i.e. those statues and paintings which they alleged to have been the focus of superstitious adoration. Thus not a single mediaeval Rood survives in Britain. They were removed as a result of the 1547 Injunctions of Edward VI (some to be restored when Mary came to the throne and removed again under Elizabeth). Of original rood lofts, also considered suspect due to their association with superstitious veneration, very few are left; surviving examples in Wales being at the ancient churches in Llanelieu, Llanengan and Llanegryn. The rood screens themselves were sometimes demolished or cut down in height, but more commonly remained with their painted figures whitewashed and painted over with religious texts. Tympanums too were whitewashed. English cathedral churches maintained their choirs, and consequently their choir stalls and pulpitum screens; but generally demolished their rood screens entirely, although those of Peterborough and Canterbury survived into the 18th century.  In the century following the English Reformation newly built Anglican churches were invariably fitted with chancel screens, which served the purpose of differentiating a separate space in the chancel for communicants at Holy Communion, as was required in the newly adopted Book of Common Prayer. In effect, these chancel screens were rood screens without a surmounting loft or crucifix, and examples survive at St John Leeds and at Foremark. New screens were also erected in many medieval churches where they had been destroyed at the Reformation, as at Cartmel Priory and Abbey Dore. From the early 17th century it became normal for screens or tympanums to carry the royal arms of England, good examples of which survive in two of the London churches of Sir Christopher Wren, and also at Derby Cathedral. However, Wren's design for the church of St James, Piccadilly, of 1684 dispensed with a chancel screen, retaining only rails around the altar itself, and this auditory church plan was widely adopted as a model for new churches from then on. In the 18th and 19th centuries hundreds of surviving medieval screens were removed altogether; today, in many British churches, the rood stair (which gave access to the rood loft) is often the only remaining trace of the former rood loft and screen. In the 19th century, the architect Augustus Pugin campaigned for the re-introduction of rood screens into Catholic church architecture. His screens survive in Macclesfield and Cheadle, Staffordshire, although others have been removed. In Anglican churches, under the influence of the Cambridge Camden Society, many medieval screens were restored; though until the 20th century, generally without roods or with only a plain cross rather than a crucifix. A nearly complete restoration can be seen at Eye, Suffolk, where the rood screen dates from 1480. Its missing rood loft was reconstructed by Sir Ninian Comper in 1925, complete with a rood and figures of saints and angels, and gives a good impression of how a full rood group might have appeared in a mediaeval English church - except that the former tympanum has not been replaced. Indeed, because tympanums, repainted with the royal arms, were erroneously considered post-medieval, they were almost all removed in the course of 19th-century restorations. For parish churches, the 19th-century Tractarians tended, however, to prefer an arrangement whereby the chancel was distinguished from the nave only by steps and a low-gated screen wall or septum (as at All Saints, Margaret Street), so as not to obscure the congregation's view of the altar. This arrangement was adopted for almost all new Anglican parish churches of the period. Painted rood screens occur rarely, but some of the best surviving examples are in East Anglia.  Notable examples Britain The earliest known example of a parochial rood screen in Britain, dating to the mid-13th century, is to be found at Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire; and a notable early stone screen (14th century) is found at Ilkeston, Derbyshire. Both these screens lack lofts, as do all surviving English screens earlier than the 15th century. However, some early screens, now lost, may be presumed to have had a loft surmounted by the Great Rood, as the churches of Colsterworth and Thurlby in Lincolnshire preserve rood stairs which can be dated stylistically to the beginning of the 13th century, and these represent the earliest surviving evidence of parochial screens; effectively contemporary with the Lateran Council. The majority of surviving screens are no earlier than the 15th century, such as those at Trull in Somerset and Attleborough in Norfolk. In many East Anglian and Devonian parish churches, original painted decoration survives on wooden screen panels, having been whitewashed over at the Reformation; although almost all have lost their rood beams and lofts, and many have been sawn off at the top of the panelled lower section. The quality of the painting and gilding is, some of it, of a very high order, notably those from the East Anglian Ranworth school of painters, of which examples can be found in Southwold and Blythburgh, as well as at Ranworth itself. The magnificent painted screen at St Michael and All Angels Church, Barton Turf in Norfolk is unique in giving an unusually complete view of the heavenly hierarchy, including nine orders of angels. Nikolaus Pevsner also identified the early-16th-century painted screen at Bridford, Devon, as being notable. The 16th-century screen at Charlton-on-Otmoor, said by Pevsner to be "the finest in Oxfordshire", has an unusual custom associated with it, where the rood cross is garlanded with flowers and foliage twice a year, and until the 1850s the cross (which at that time resembled a large corn dolly) was carried in a May Day procession. A particularly large example can be found at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Uffculme, Devon, which is nearly 70 feet in length.

Sequatchie County is a county located in the U.S. state of Tennessee. As of the 2020 census, the population was 15,826. Its county seat is Dunlap. Sequatchie County is part of the Chattanooga, TN–GA Metropolitan Statistical Area.  History Sequatchie County was created in 1857 from two districts of Marion County and one district of Bledsoe County. It was named for the Sequatchie Valley, which in turn had been named for a Cherokee chief. The word sequachee from ᏏᏆ ᎤᏤᏥᏍᏘ siqua utsedsdi in Cherokee means 'opossum' or 'he grins.'  Settlers began arriving in what is now Sequatchie by the early 19th century, drawn to the area by the fertile land in the valley. At the outset of the Civil War, Sequatchie was divided over the issue of secession. On June 8, 1861, Sequatchie Countians voted in favor of Tennessee's Ordinance of Secession by a vote 153 to 100.  In October 1863, Confederate General Joseph Wheeler led a raid into Sequatchie, burning nearly a thousand wagons and capturing livestock. During the late 19th century, the Douglas Coal and Coke Company (later the Chattanooga Iron and Coal Corporation) conducted extensive mining activities in the Dunlap area. The company constructed 268 beehive ovens, now known as the Dunlap Coke Ovens, to convert coal into coke. The ovens are now the focus of a local park.  Geography According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 266 square miles (690 km2), of which 266 square miles (690 km2) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2) (0.07%) is water. Sequatchie is one of three counties (along with Bledsoe and Marion) situated in the Sequatchie Valley, a long, narrow valley running northeast-to-southwest across the eastern portion of the Cumberland Plateau. The county is flanked by the Plateau's Walden Ridge escarpment on the east. The Sequatchie River, which spans the valley, passes through the county. Two major highways, U.S. Route 127 and Tennessee State Route 111, intersect in Dunlap.

Julian Dashper (29 February 1960 in Auckland, New Zealand – 30 July 2009), was regarded as one of New Zealand's most well known contemporary artists.  History In 2001 he was awarded a senior Fulbright fellowship to be based as an artist in residence at the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas. Dashper's work from the last 25 years has recently been the subject of a major touring retrospective in America (the first ever such exhibition for a resident New Zealand artist), curated by Christopher Cook and David Raskin. Dashper's work focuses on the histories, theories and more general or popular ideas of abstraction (in particular abstract painting), conceptualism and minimalism as a working methodology. The geographical positioning of New Zealand globally and how this country receives and disseminates visual information is also a core subject in Dashper's work. His practice manifests itself in various forms, including paintings, unique photographs of paintings, found objects which he infuses with abstract images, various multiples plus limited edition CD and 12" polycarbonate recordings of impromptu performances he has been involved with or heavily orchestrated. He has also produced a number of video works, some of which document or describe his installations, painting and audio recordings. In 2016, arts organisation Circuit commissioned George Clark to curate a programme of moving image works, titled This is not film-making, which invited artists Gavin Hipkins, Juliet Carpenter and Gregory Kan, Daniel Malone, Louise Menzies and Nathan Gray to make works that respond to Dashper's own writings. Respectful, even affectionate references to local culture and art history are always present in Dashper's work, whilst his own adaptations of abstraction, conceptualism and minimalism fully acknowledge their lineage within international art. As curator (and director of the Adam Art Gallery in Wellington) Christina Barton expresses it, Dashper has "the unique perspective of attending to an internationalist art history from a distance, enabling him to devise strategies to work around his geographical isolation whilst simultaneously articulating its effects." Dashper is represented in all the major public collections in New Zealand: MCA, Sydney; Ludwig Forum für Internationale Kunst, Aachen, Germany; Sheldon Museum of Art, Lincoln, Nebraska; The University of Auckland Art Collection; Ulrich Museum of Art, Wichita, Kansas and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. Visiting scholar at the University of Sydney in 2008, Dashper lived in Auckland and travelled regularly. His first New Zealand retrospective, Julian Dashper: Professional Practice, was held at the Gus Fisher Gallery in 2010. Dashper's partner, Maire Shannon, is the mother of his son, Leo, and also collated and organized his work after his death.  Selected solo exhibitions 1980  Motorway Schools 100m2, Auckland.

Transforming Teaching, Education & Learning (T-TEL) is a Ghanaian not-for-profit organization that provides technical advice, project management, research and implementation support services using local expertise to advance Ghana's education system. T-TEL was established on 7 July 2020 as an independent Ghanaian not-for-profit organization by fifteen (15) subscribers. The subscribers are the legal custodians of the organization.[1] T-TEL's vision is "Transformed Education for Development".  History The Transforming Teacher Education and Learning programme started in November 2014 to support the 46 public colleges of education to improve teacher education. The late Vice President of Ghana, Paa Kwesi Amissah - Arthur launched the programme in December 2015. In December, 2018 the programme was extended for a further two years (December 2020) to support the transition period of the four-year Bachelors of Education (B.Ed.) degree, which replaced the Diploma in Basic Education (DBE) in October 2018. Transforming Teaching, Education & Learning was established on 7 July 2020 after successful completion of the initial teacher education project so that T-TEL could continue supporting Ghana's education system.  Activities The Transforming Teacher Education and Learning programme was designed to address poor learning outcomes by improving tutoring in colleges of education so that newly qualified teachers move away from rote learning and become better prepared to use interactive methods and their subject knowledge in the classroom. T-TEL is implementing the following projects. Transforming Senior High School Education, Teaching and Learning (T-SHEL) project. Transforming Senior High School Education, Teaching and Learning (T-SHEL) is a Government of Ghana programme implemented in partnership with Mastercard Foundation.

Clube Desportivo dos Olivais e Moscavide is a centenary club located in the eastern area of Lisbon that distinguishes itself in practice in different levels of football, basketball, American Football and Table Football, in addition to developing various recreational and sociocultural activities.  History Founded on September 1, 1912, in the Parish of Santa Maria dos Olivais where the Oriente Station is currently located (currently the Parish of Parque das Nações), it had as its first name Rua Nova Foot-ball Club where it participated in 1931/32 in the District Championship of Promotion of the Lisbon Football Association, having achieved that same year promotion to the 2nd District Division. In 1935 it adopts the name Clube Desportivo dos Olivais. In 1943/44 he won the defunct AFL Cup of Honor. In 1972/73 he became Champion of the 2nd Division of the AFL. In 1976/77 it reached the National Championships for the first time when it ascended to the 3rd National Division, definitively changing its name to Clube Desportivo dos Olivais e Moscavide. In the year he won the AFL Cup of Honor in 1982/83, he was recognized as an Institution of Public Utility by the Portuguese Government, winning again the AFL Cup of Honor in 1984/85 and 1986/87. In 1988/89, he obtained the best classification ever in his history, finishing in 9th place in the National Championship of the 2nd Division. In 1991/92 wins the South Zone of the National Championship of the 3rd Division. On 08/31/1993, the Portuguese State awarded the SPORTS MERITO MEDAL, the most important decoration held by the club. In 1994/95 the participation in the Portuguese Cup is marked by the elimination in the quarter-finals by Sporting CP (which would win the competition) in front of more than 5 thousand spectators, the biggest attendance until today verified in the Alfredo Marques Augusto Stadium. In 2000/01 he won his first national title when he became National Champion of the 3rd National Division, a feat that would be surpassed when he reached the 2nd national title when in 2005/06 he became National Champion of the 2nd National Division. In 2006/07 it integrates the Professional Championships in the then called Division of Honor. In 2006, he received the Medal of Sporting Merit from the Municipality of Loures. In 2013/14, in the second season of his return to the AFL district championships, he won the AFL 3rd Division Championship. In the 2019/20 season, playing in the AFL 2nd Division Championship, wins the AFL Cup whose final was played in calendar year 2021. In 2022, for the second year in a row, he won the AFL Cup. It currently competes in the AFL Division 1 Championship.  Honours Segunda Divisão Champions (1): 2005–06 Terceira Divisão Champions (1): 2000–01  References External links Facebook Instagram

The Church Army is an evangelistic organisation and mission community founded in 1882 in association with the Church of England and now operating internationally in many parts of the Anglican Communion.  History The Church Army was founded in England in 1882 by the Revd. Wilson Carlile (afterwards prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral), who brought together soldiers, officers and a few working men and women whom he and others trained to act as Church of England evangelists among the poor and outcasts of the Westminster slums. As a curate in the parish of St Mary Abbots, Kensington, Carlile had experimented with unorthodox forms of Christian meetings and witness, going to where coachmen, valets and others would take their evening stroll and holding open air services, persuading onlookers to say the Scripture readings, and training working people to preach. Carlile wanted to share the Gospel with people who would not dream of setting foot inside a church and training people of the same class—ordinary lay people—as evangelists. At the same time, similar groups were appearing; the Revd. Evan Hopkins was organising a "Church Gospel Army" and other clergy had established a "Church Salvation Army" at Oxford and a "Church Mission Army" at Bristol. Carlile suggested a combined "Church Army". As the work grew, a training institution for evangelists was started in Oxford with F. S. Webster as principal, but soon moved (1886) to London, where, in Bryanston Street near Marble Arch, the headquarters of the army was established. Working men were trained as evangelists, and working women as mission sisters, and were supplied to the clergy. The male evangelists had to pass an examination by the Archdeacon of Middlesex, and were then (from 1896) admitted by the bishop of London as "lay evangelists in the Church". The mission sisters likewise passed an examination by the diocesan inspector of schools. Church Army workers were entirely under the control of the incumbent of the parish to which they were sent, and were paid a small sum for their services either by the vicar or by voluntary local contributions. Church Army vehicles circulated throughout the country parishes, if desired, with itinerant evangelists, who held simple missions, without charge, and distributed literature. Marie Louise Carlile (1861-1951), Wilson Carlile's sister, was a frail woman who left a life of elegance for the tough and austere life of training women in 1888, followed by the first "Rescue Shelter" for women in 1891. She continued in the mission for fifty years as leader of the Church Army Sisters. William Booth had already seen the extreme poverty and need for unorthodox evangelism work, and since 1865 had been developing a similar mission (in 1878 given the name "The Salvation Army"), using similar "Christian soldier" metaphors, also in London slums. Church of England bishops approached Booth about the time Church Army was founded to join in their work in the slums, but he declined.  Both the Church Army and the Salvation Army continued to work in the slums; both had some difficulty with their parent churches (Church of England and Methodist) being able to cope with those coming out of the slums as a result of the mission work, and realised the need for alcohol-free refuges. In 1888, the Church Army established labour homes in London and elsewhere, with the object of giving a "fresh start in life" to the outcast and destitute. The inmates earned their board and lodging by piece work, for which they were paid at the current trade rates, and were encouraged to seek other positions for themselves. The Church Army had lodging homes, employment bureaus, cheap food depots, old clothes department, a dispensary and a number of other social works. There was also an extensive emigration system, under which many hundreds (3,000 in 1906) of men and families were placed in permanent employment in Canada through the agency of the local clergy. During the First World War, Church Army was very active among the troops in France, and ran around 2000 social clubs across France. In 1965, a new chapel, the Church Army Chapel, Blackheath and college designed by E. T. Spashett in Vanbrugh Park, Blackheath, London SE3 was opened by Princess Alexandra and consecrated by Michael Ramsey. The Headquarters were in Marylebone Road, London NW. In 1978, Church Army purchased Winchester House, a former missionary school (see Eltham College) in Blackheath, south-east London, to be refurbished as its new headquarters. It was officially opened by the Queen Mother on 12 June 1980. In 1992, the Church Army vacated the Vanbrugh Park college buildings and the college was relocated to Sheffield; the buildings were taken over by Blackheath High School. In 2010, the national office of Church Army relocated from Sidcup in London to the Wilson Carlile Centre in Sheffield (formerly the training college), bringing together the national staff with the training and research staff.  Training became non-residential and the building was converted to provide national offices and modern conferencing facilities together with en-suite accommodation.  Principles and practices The Church Army has over 300 commissioned evangelists who have been commissioned and admitted in the Church of England after 2–4 years of training. Church Army Evangelists will not necessarily work directly for the Church Army but may instead work in Anglican churches, projects and teams in the United Kingdom and Ireland. There are similarities to the Salvation Army, and the two sometimes work together (such as in the Fresh expressions initiative), but the Church Army is not a separate church denomination. The Church Army's funded work focuses on centres of mission and key projects and tend to operate in areas of deprivation. The first centre of mission was established in 2008 and many more have been launched across the UK and Ireland since. A centre of mission is formed in partnership with a Church of England diocese in order to support the Christian outreach in an area. A centre of mission's purpose is to support and connect with communities, normally with high levels of poverty, outside of the church. This work does not operate from a physical building but sees partnerships with local initiatives and organisations and setting up new groups and activities for a community. The work is contextual and varied depending on the needs of an area. Some examples of the work that centres of mission do includes setting up youth groups, running foodbanks and food provision services, launching fresh expressions of Church to help people engage with God outside of a traditional church service setting, and supporting the homeless, lonely, those struggling with poverty, sex workers, and other isolated or marginalised groups. Church Army key projects include:  Cardiff Residential Services (supporting homeless young people in Cardiff through accommodation at Ty Bronna and wider support) The Amber Project (supporting young people in Cardiff and surrounding areas who have experience of self-harm, through counselling, workshops, theatre groups, and informal support) Marylebone Project (working with homeless women in London as one of the largest women's only hostels in the UK and Ireland, wrap-around support, and rough sleeper drop in) Made in Marylebone (a social enterprise for homeless women in London, providing training and work experience in catering and business) The current president of the Church Army is Rowan Williams, previous Archbishop of Canterbury and before him Desmond Tutu, emeritus Archbishop of Cape Town and Nobel Peace Prize laureate was the president. Every September, the Church Army celebrates Church Army Sunday; this is the Sunday nearest 26 September (the anniversary of Carlile's death in 1942), the day on which Carlile and the Church Army are celebrated in the revised Anglican Lectionary. Des Scott was appointed interim CEO in June 2019 after Mark Russell's resignation, and was the Church Army's CEO, leading the organisation in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Scott has been part of the Church Army for over 30 years in various roles including as a London youth worker, overseeing the Church Army's operational team, and held the post of deputy CEO from 2012 until being appointed as interim CEO.  Church Army International Church Army International, established in 2006, is an association of eight independent Church Army societies around the world (Africa, Australia, Barbados, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand, United Kingdom and Ireland, and the United States) working in over 15 countries. The purpose is to facilitate communication, co-operation, fellowship and shared vision between Church Army societies and to promote the growth of the Church Army's ministry worldwide. The leader of each society is a member of the Church Army International Leaders' Forum chaired by the international secretary. The forum has four telephone conferences each year and the leaders together with those responsible for training and board representatives meet together for a residential conference approximately every three years. In 2009 the Church Army in Canada was renamed Threshold Ministries.  Training The Church Army trains individuals in evangelism vocation. A selection process by the Church Army ascertains whether a vocation in evangelism is suited to an individual before beginning a 2-4 year training course. Church Army training aims to develop understanding of pioneering evangelism. All training is part-time alongside other work or personal commitments to allow learning to be practiced in context. Training includes opportunities for practical mission, weekend training residentials with interactive teaching sessions, and sessions with a Reflector with whom to discuss growth and personal development. In the past, the Church Army training was full-time residential. Between 1965 and 1991 the Wilson Carlile Training College was at 27 Vanburgh Park, Blackheath, where the premises included the Church Army Chapel. The last training college was at the Wilson Carlile Centre in Sheffield. The buildings previously used for residential evangelists is now a conferencing centre and accommodation. Each additional Church Army Society internationally is responsible for the training of its evangelists. In some situations, students are paired with evangelists currently serving in the field; others attend residential schooling.  Leadership General secretary  1942–1949: The Revd. Hubert H.

Epichloë hybrida is a systemic, asexual and seed-transmissible endophyte of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) within the genus Epichloë. An interspecies allopolyploid of two haploid parent species Epichloë typhina and Epichloë festucae var. lolii (previously classified as Neotyphodium lolii), E. hybrida was first identified in 1989, recognized as an interspecific hybrid in 1994, but only formally named in 2017. Previously this species was often informally called Epichloë typhina x Epichloë festucae var. lolii, or referenced by the identifier of its most well-studied strain, Lp1. Epichloë hybrida is a symbiont of perennial ryegrass where its presence is almost entirely asymptomatic. The species has been commercialized for the benefits of its anti-insect compounds in a pasture setting, although it is now more commonly used as an experimental model system for studying interspecific hybridization in fungi. The type specimen of E. hybrida is held in the American Type Culture Collection under holotype accession number TSD-66.  Hybrid status The genus Epichloë is characterized by the frequent formation of interspecific, typically asexual, allopolyploid species that are commonly referred to as hybrids. Haploid, sexual Epichloë species usually carry only one homeolog ('gene copy') at a given genetic locus, but interspecific hybrids were originally identified by the presence of two or three homeologs, indicating their origin from two or three different parent species. As of 2016, Epichloë had the most known interspecific hybrids of any fungal genus. Epichloë hybrida was one of the first Epichloë hybrids identified. Although the date of the hybridization event is not known with any certainty, an upper bound of ~300,000 years has been estimated. The colony morphology of E. hybrida Lp1 is a compact form with wavy edges, in contrast to the morphology of either parent. Conidia stained with DAPI, which binds to DNA, show only a single nucleus, confirming that E. hybrida is mononucleate and not simply an interspecies dikaryon.  Uniparental inheritance of mtDNA and rDNA With few exceptions, the full complement of nuclear genes appear to be inherited and retained from both parent species. In contrast, the mitochondrial DNA of E. hybrida is derived only from E. festucae var. lolii, while the ribosomal DNA only exists as the E. typhina rDNA sequence type, with the other parental type likely lost through concerted evolution. In consequence, the ribosomes of E. hybrida likely consist of E. typhina rRNA, but a mix of E. festucae var. lolii and E. typhina ribosomal proteins. Although the presence of divergently evolved ribosomal proteins might be expected to create poorly functioning ribosomes, most E. festucae var. lolii and E. typhina ribosomal protein genes have similar expression levels. It therefore appears that the gene expression of E. festucae var. lolii ribosomal proteins has not been suppressed despite the potential for ribosomal incompatibilities.  History Epichloë hybrida was first isolated from perennial ryegrass seeds collected as part of a national breeding program funded by the French Ministry of Agriculture in the early 1980s. Run by Gilles Charmet and François Balfourier at the National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRA) in Clermont-Ferrand, 547 natural ryegrass populations were sampled across France by INRA researchers and a national team of ten private breeders. A core collection of 110 accessions, including the E. hybrida source population, was transferred to INRA Lusignan in 2000, where it now forms the basis of the modern French perennial ryegrass breeding program. Accession F187 was collected in the summer of 1983 by Joël Meunier, an employee of the French breeding company Maïsadour Archived 2017-12-01 at the Wayback Machine, and as of 2016 was entered into the INRA collection under accession number #010204. The collection site was a natural meadow near the village of Bidache in the French administrative department of Pyrénées Atlantiques in southwestern France. Less than 30 km from the Atlantic coast and under 100 m in altitude, this area has hot summers and mild winters, and is very wet with substantial rainfall throughout the year. In the late 1980s, the INRA collection was shared with Sydney Easton, a plant breeder in what was then the New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), and this New Zealand branch of the collection is now housed in the Margot Forde Germplasm Centre at the AgResearch Crown Research Institute. Accession F187 was recoded as accession A6056 at that time. An endophyte program aimed at systematically isolating agriculturally promising Epichloë strains from this and other ryegrass seed collections was undertaken by Garrick Latch in the late 1980s/early 1990s. A ryegrass seedling from the INRA F187 seed lot was recognized as producing desirable anti-insect compounds. Originally called 187BB, E. hybrida Lp1 was identified in 1989 as the twenty-eighth isolate obtained from the seed batch. This isolate was placed within a group of Epichloë strains known as Lolium perenne Taxonomic Group 2, LpTG-2, which the formal E. hybrida species definition is now expected to encompass.   == References ==

Regional 1 Midlands (until 2021–22 known as Midlands Premier and up until 2016–17 known as National League 3 Midlands) is a level five semi-professional league in the English rugby union system. It is one of six leagues at this level. When this division began in 1987 it was known as Midlands Division 1. The format of the league was changed at the beginning of the 2009–10 season following a reorganisation by the Rugby Football Union (RFU), and the name change from National League 3 to Premier was introduced for the 2017–18 season by the RFU in order to lessen confusion for what is a series of regional leagues. Regional 1 Midlands is the highest regional rugby union league in the English Midlands. Oxford Harlequins  are the current champions and are promoted to National League 2 West. Old Halesonians (11th) and  Broadstreet (12th) are relegated.  Format The club that finishes as champions is automatically promoted to National League 2 West. Relegated teams drop down to either, Regional 2 East Midlands, Regional 2 North Midlands or Regional 2 West Midlands, depending on their location, and other factors such as the location of relegated and promoted teams in other divisions. The season runs from September to April and comprises twenty-two rounds of matches, with each club playing each of its rivals home and away. The results of the matches contribute points to the league table as follows:  4 points are awarded for a win 2 points are awarded for a draw 0 points are awarded for a loss, however 1 losing (bonus) point is awarded to a team that loses a match by 7 points or fewer 1 additional (bonus) point is awarded to a team scoring 4 tries or more in a match  2023–24 Participating teams and locations League table Results 2022–23 Dudley Kingswinford  won the league and were promoted to National League 2 West. Lichfield (11th) and Nuneaton (12th) were relegated to Regional 2 North Midlands and Regional 2 East Midlands respectively.  Participating teams and locations Final league table Results 2021–22 Participating teams and locations Ten of the fourteen teams participated in last season's competition. They are joined by one relegated side, Scunthorpe (from National League 2 North), while the three teams promoted into the division are Dudley Kingswinford (from Midlands 1 West, Oundle and Syston (both from Midlands 1 East. Last seasons champions, Bournville were promoted into National League 2 North. Teams relegated from the division were Kettering and Peterborough (who drop to Midlands 1 East). Also not returning are South Leicester who withdrew from the league during the 2019–20 season and drop to Midlands 4 East (South) for the coming season. The teams competing in 2021–22 achieved their places in the league based on performances in 2019–20, the 'previous season' column in the table below refers to that season not 2020–21.  Final league table 2020–21 On 30 October 2020 the RFU announced that due to the coronavirus pandemic a decision had been taken to cancel Adult Competitive Leagues (National League 1 and below) for the 2020/21 season meaning Midlands Premier was not contested.  2019–20 Participating teams and locations Nine of the fourteen teams participated in last season's competition. They are joined by two relegated sides; Peterborough Lions and South Leicester (relegated from National League 2 North), while the three teams promoted into the division are Bromsgrove, Kettering and Paviors.  In order to address an imbalance of teams at level 5, Bedford Athletic have been level transferred into the division from London & South East Premier. Birmingham & Solihull were initially relegated into the division from National League 2 South but decided to drop out of the league system altogether (joining the Greater Birmingham Merit Leagues) as they became an amateur club. Last seasons champions, Scunthorpe were promoted into National League 2 North, along with Luctonians who won their play-off game against North Premier runners up Blaydon.  Teams relegated from the division included Derby and Syston (who drop to Midlands 1 East) and Lichfield (who fall to Midlands 1 West).  2018–19 Participating teams and locations Nine of the fourteen teams participated in last season's competition.

Last seasons champions, Broadstreet, were promoted into National League 2 South following a level transfer, while runners-up Sheffield went into National League 2 North, having won their playoff game.  Teams relegated from the league included Bedford Athletic and Syston, with Sandbach given a reprieve by the RFU in light of the London Welsh liquidation, by virtue of being the best ranked third bottom side in tier 5 for 2016–17.  Finally Towcestrians were level transferred from Midlands Premier into London & South East Premier, while Doncaster Phoenix were level transferred into Midlands Premier from North Premier to address an imbalance of teams in the three divisions. Birmingham & Solihull won the title on 7 April.  2016–17 Participating teams and locations Eight of the fourteen teams participated in last season's competition.

Scunthorpe (champions) and Hinckley (play-off) were promoted into National League 2 North while Old Northamptonians were relegated to Midlands 1 East and Sutton Coldfield and Newport (Salop) both dropped to Midlands 1 West. In order to address a league imbalance due to only one team coming down from National League 2 South, Bromsgrove (who had finished 11th), were level transferred to National League 3 South West.  Final league table Promotion play-off Each season, the runners-up in the National League 3 Midlands, and National League 3 North participate in a play-off for promotion to National League 2 North.

Midlands 1 (1992–1993) For the 1991–92 season Midlands 1 remained a tier 5 league with promotion to Area League North.  However, restructuring of the Midlands leagues meant that relegation was now to Midlands 2 (formerly Midlands 2 East and Midlands 2 West).  Midlands 1 (1993–1996) The top six teams from Midlands 1 and the top six from North 1 were combined to create National 5 North.  Midlands 1 dropped to become a tier 6 league and was one of two feeder leagues for National 5 North.  Relegation continued to Midlands 2 (currently Midlands 1 East and Midlands 1 West)  Midlands 1 (1996–2000) At the end of the 1995–96 season National 5 North was discontinued and Midlands 1 returned to being a tier 5 league. Promotion was now to National 4 North (currently National League 2 North), while relegation continued to Midlands 2 (currently split into Midlands 1 East and Midlands 1 West).  Midlands 1 (2000–2009) Restructuring ahead of the 2000–01 season saw Midlands 1 remain a tier 5 league but promotion was now to National 3 North (formerly National 4 North) and relegation to either Midlands 2 East or Midlands 2 West (both formerly Midlands 2).  National League 3 Midlands (2009–2017) The division was renamed National League 3 Midlands following a restructuring of the national leagues which led to changes at all levels. It remained a tier 5 league with promotion  to National League 2 North (formerly National League 3 North) and relegation to either Midlands 1 East or Midlands 1 West (formerly Midlands 2 East / Midlands 2 West).  Midlands Premier (2017–2022) For the 2017–18 season, all the divisions at tier 5 were renamed from National League 3 to Premier resulting in National League 3 Midlands now named the Midlands Premier. Promotion continued to National League 2 North and relegation to either Midlands 1 East or Midlands 1 West.  Regional 1 Midlands (2022– ) Promotion play-offs Between 2000–01 and 2019–20 there was a play-off between the league runners-up of Midlands Premier and North Premier for the third and final promotion place to National League 2 North. The team with the superior league record had home advantage. At the end of the 2019–20 season, the northern teams have been stronger with twelve wins to the Midlands seven, while the home team has won thirteen times compared to the away teams six.

Gwynne Shotwell (née Rowley, previously Gurevich; born November 23, 1963) is an American businesswoman and engineer. She is the president and chief operating officer of SpaceX, an American space transportation company, where she is responsible for day-to-day operations and company growth. As of 2023, Shotwell is listed as the 31st most powerful woman in the world by Forbes. In 2020, Time magazine named her as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2018, she was listed as the most powerful female engineer by Business Insider.  Early life Shotwell was born in Evanston, Illinois, as the middle of three daughters to a brain surgeon and an artist, and was raised in Libertyville, Illinois. In 1982, she graduated from Libertyville High School. In 1969, she watched a television broadcast of the Apollo 11 mission with her family, but remembers finding it "boring" and was not interested in space at the time. Shotwell excelled in both academics and athletics in high school, where she was on the cheerleading and varsity basketball teams while achieving at the top of her class. Her interests changed during high school after her mother took her to a panel discussion at the Illinois Institute of Technology by the Society of Women Engineers, where a mechanical engineer in particular inspired Shotwell to become an engineer. Following this, she decided to apply to Northwestern University, where she received a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering, and later a Master of Science degree in applied mathematics.  Career At the beginning of her career, Shotwell had an interview with IBM on the day of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, which disturbed her and she did not get a job offer. Instead, Shotwell took a job in the automotive industry at Chrysler Corporation's management training program, which she initially enjoyed but later grew tired of and left to return to Northwestern for her graduate degree. In 1988, Shotwell began work at the El Segundo research center of The Aerospace Corporation, and did technical work on military space research and development contracts. An early project she worked on was STS-39. During a ten-year tenure, she worked in thermal analysis. Shotwell worked in both space systems engineering and project management positions. She left The Aerospace Corporation in 1998 to become director of the space systems division at Microcosm Inc., a small rocket company in El Segundo. There, she served on the executive committee and was responsible for business development.  SpaceX Shotwell left Microcosm in 2002 to join SpaceX, a private, commercial, space exploration company founded by Elon Musk in the same year. She was introduced to Musk through her former Microcosm colleague Hans Koenigsmann who had joined SpaceX. In that meeting, she convinced Musk that SpaceX should hire a dedicated employee to work on business development full-time, but had not planned to join the company herself. Shotwell took the job two weeks later in September 2002. In December 2008, Shotwell was promoted to company president following her role in the successful negotiation of the first Commercial Resupply Services contract with the NASA Associate Administrator Bill Gerstenmaier. This followed SpaceX's first successful launch of the Falcon 1 on its fourth attempt earlier in the year. She was responsible for leading the effort on building the Falcon Vehicle manifest to over 50 launches, generating $5 billion in revenue. This included a commercial connection to the International Space Station for resupplying services, where they were able to deliver cargo and supplies to the astronauts. Shotwell is currently the President and COO of SpaceX, responsible for day-to-day operations and managing all customer and strategic relations to support company growth. She oversaw the first landing of an orbital rocket's first stage on land and on an ocean platform, the first relaunch and landing of a used orbital rocket, the first controlled flyback and recovery of a payload fairing, and the first re-flight of a commercial cargo spacecraft. SpaceX has a multibillion-dollar contract with NASA to deliver astronauts and science instruments to the International Space Station. On May 30, 2020, SpaceX became the first private company to launch two astronauts to Earth orbit. In February 2019, Polaris Industries announced that Shotwell would join their board of directors in March. Shotwell has served on the California Space Authority Board of Directors and its executive committee after she was elected in 2004. She has served as an officer on the AIAA Space Systems Technical Committee and participates in a variety of STEM related programs. She led a committee that raised over $350,000 in scholarships for the Frank J. Redd Student Competition over 6 years. Shotwell has been criticized for her response to several alleged cases of sexism, sexual harassment and assault at SpaceX.  Starlink In Ukraine Following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Shotwell led negotiations with government agencies for requested Starlink satellite services in the country, which were at first donated by SpaceX. These arrangements were later formalized in a DoD contract to buy Starlink for Ukraine. Earlier, Shotwell had announced that her company took measures to prevent the use of Starlink to control combat drones. She stated Ukrainians had used the service in ways not part of the agreement, as she had accepted to donate Starlink satellite services for communications, defense and humanitarian purposes such as "ambulances, hospitals and mothers" but had not intended it to be weaponized for drone strikes.  Public outreach Shotwell gave a TEDx Talk at TEDxChapmanU in June 2013 on the importance of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. She speaks regularly to business audiences and gave a talk for the "Captains of Industry" series at the Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security in June 2014 on private entrepreneurial accomplishments in advancing spaceflight technology. At the 2018 TED conference, Shotwell was interviewed by Chris Anderson about the future plans of SpaceX. At the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing on September 28, 2018, Shotwell's talk was titled "Launching Our Future" and she discussed her vision and advancements for aerospace technology, as well as why diversity and the inclusion of women are necessary to advance as a society.  Personal life Shotwell is married to an engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She has two children from a previous marriage with Leon Gurevich.

John Ashburnham (1603 – 15 June 1671) was an English courtier, diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1640 and 1667. He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War and was an attendant on the King.  Background Ashburnham was the eldest son of Sir John Ashburnham by Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Beaumont. His father was a wastrel and died in 1620, but his mother was related to Lady Villiers, mother of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. Under Buckingham's patronage Ashburnham became well known to the king Charles I, who styled him "Jack Ashburnham" in his letters. In 1628 Ashburnham became groom of the bedchamber. Ashburnham became wealthy and lent money to the king: in 1638 the Star-chamber fine on Sir Walter Long, 1st Baronet and his brother, was assigned to Ashburnham. The next year a warrant under the privy seal enabled him to regain his ancestral estate of Ashburnham. He sat as a member of parliament for Hastings in the Long Parliament in 1640. As a partisan of the king, he began to absent himself, and he was proceeded against for contempt (6 May 1642). The king wrote a letter to the Commons in his justification but the house maintained its prior right to the obedience of its member. Ashburnham was 'discharged and disabled' (5 February 1643), and his estate was sequestrated (14 September).  Civil War Ashburnham was a faithful adherent and attendant to Charles I in the First English Civil War, and became the treasurer and paymaster of the king's army. His name occurs in seven negotiations for peace. He was one of the commissioners at the Treaty of Uxbridge (1644), and one of the four appointed to lay the king's proposals before parliament (December 1645). When Thomas Fairfax prepared to besiege Oxford, and Charles determined upon flight, Ashburnham and Michael Hudson were the sole attendants to the king in his journey from Oxford to the Scottish camp outside Newark-on-Trent. Hudson was released, and Ashburnham was positively commanded by the king to flee before confirmation of the order to send him up to London as a delinquent could be received. He made his way safely to Holland, and thence to Queen Henrietta Maria at Paris. In 1647 the army had the king in custody at Holmby, and allowed him his choice of servants. Ashburnham resumed his attendance on his master at Hampton Court, where Charles was in constant fear of assassination. At Ashburnham's suggestion he made proposals to the Scottish commissioners for his sudden journey to London and personal treaty with the parliament. But the arrangement fell through. Charles was then impatient to be gone, commanded Ashburnham and his other confidants, Sir John Berkeley and William Legge, to propose some place for him to go to. Ashburnham mentioned Sir John Oglander's house in the Isle of Wight as a place where the king might be concealed. The plan was to sound out the governor of the island, Colonel Robert Hammond. If Hammond were not to be trusted, the fugitive Charles could secretly take ship for France. In the end Berkeley revealed the hiding-place to Hammond; Charles refused the desperate offer of Ashburnham to kill Hammond, and again became virtually a prisoner.  Commonwealth period Subsequently, the Commonwealth authorities detained Ashburnham in the Tower of London and three times banished him to the Channel Islands. Ashburnham was parted from his master Charles by order of the parliament, 1 January 1648, was imprisoned in Windsor Castle (May), and when the Second English Civil War broke out was exchanged for Sir William Masham. He was not allowed to attend the king during the Treaty of Newport (August), and was included among the delinquents who were to expect no pardon (13 October). He was constantly harassed. He had acquired an estate by his second marriage with the Dowager Lady Poulett (1649) (Widow of John Poulett, 1st Baron Poulett), and Charles II gave him permission to stay in England to preserve it. Royalists, however, suspected his fidelity, and (March 1650) in a memorial to the king asked whether they might trust him. He was sued for debts contracted for the late Charles I. He was forced to compound for one half of his estate, was bound in heavy securities to appear, when required, before the council of state, and his private journeys were licensed by a pass from the council. For three years he was asked by committees to discover who had lent the king money during the wars. His three banishments to Guernsey Castle were for sending money to the king.  1660 Restoration After the Restoration Ashburnham served Charles II as a diplomat; and he was member of parliament for Sussex between 1661 and 1667 in the Cavalier Parliament.  In September 1661, he was the head of a commission to inquire into the abuses in the post office. His house at Chiswick, with its contents, was purchased by the king for the Duke of Monmouth, of whom (January 1665) he was made one of the guardians. His loans to Charles I were paid by grants of crown leases. He and his brother William Ashburnham shared in an enterprise for reviving the manufacture of tapestry at the Mortlake Tapestry Works (March and April 1667). His large memorial tomb by Thomas Burman stands in St Peter's Church in Ashburnham, East Sussex.  Family Ashburnham's daughter Elizabeth married Sir Hugh Smith, 1st Baronet of Long Ashton.

"Check My Brain" is a song by the American rock band Alice in Chains, featured on their fourth studio album, Black Gives Way to Blue (2009). It was released as the first official single from the album on August 14, 2009, marking it as the band's first single in a decade (since 1999's "Fear the Voices"). The single topped the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks and Billboard Hot Rock Songs charts in September 2009. This was the first time an Alice in Chains song would hit number-one on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart since their 1994 single "No Excuses". This is Alice in Chains' first and currently only song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 92, and also their first number-one on the Alternative Songs chart. "Check My Brain" received a nomination for "Best Hard Rock Performance" at the 52nd Grammy Awards.  Lyrics "Check My Brain" features the lyric "California's all right/Somebody check my brain...". The lyric is in reference to guitarist Jerry Cantrell moving to Los Angeles, California in 2003, with Cantrell commenting, "I like how I am right now...and I like where I'm living." Cantrell on the song:  There's a certain aspect of sarcasm, I guess, being a guy from Seattle who lives in L.A., ex-drug addict who lives in the belly of the beast and doesn't partake, and being totally cool with that...It's like being the bad gambler and living in Vegas. It's right there. It's just the irony of that and a little bit of sarcasm. And it's not putting this place down at all. It's just kind of like, 'Wow, you know, check my brain, wow.'  Composition It is in F minor. The tonic (F) is played as F♭ bent up, so it can be unbent back to F♭. (The guitars are downtuned (which is "standard Alice in Chains tuning" according to Cantrell) and the bass is drop D.) Both the bass and rhythm guitar do this. Also the vocals follow. The chords in the chorus are F5, E♭5, B♭5, A♭5, B♭5, C5, F5.  Release and reception On August 12, 2009, the band released a 30-second sample of the new single. On August 14, 2009, the full version of the song was released to radio stations as the first official single from the album. "A Looking in View" was available for purchase and was streaming for free on the band's website in June 2009, but it wasn't released as the album's first single. Ronald Hart of Billboard said that the song "is faithful to the grunge terrain Alice in Chains mapped out in 1995. Written by guitarist/chief songwriter Jerry Cantrell, who shares lead vocal duties with William DuVall, the song revolves around Cantrell's distaste for his relocation from rainy Seattle to sunny Los Angeles. The band's classic, downtuned stomp could easily pass for an unreleased track from the Dirt era and is sure to keep longtime fans feeling pleasantly dystopic." In 2012, Loudwire ranked the song at number 39 on their list of "Top 50 Hard Rock Songs of the 21st Century".  In popular culture "Check My Brain" was released as downloadable content for the Rock Band and Rock Band 2 music video games for the Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3 consoles, as part of Alice in Chains Pack 01, which also includes older hits "Rooster", "Would?", and "No Excuses", along with "A Looking in View", also from Black Gives Way to Blue. It was added to the Xbox Live Marketplace and in-game Music Store for the Wii on September 29, 2009 and it was added to the PlayStation Network on October 1, 2009. The song was featured in the season four premiere of the Showtime series Californication, "Exile on Main St." in 2011, when Charlie picks up Hank from jail.  Music video The music video for "Check My Brain" premiered on September 14, 2009 and was directed by Alexandre Courtes. The video shows the band in a discolored setting in Los Angeles, California where Cantrell moved in 2003. On October 1, 2009, Alice in Chains released a behind-the-scenes video about the making of the music video.  Live performances Alice in Chains debuted "Check My Brain" on August 1, 2009 in Marlay Park, Dublin, Ireland. They played it again the next day at the Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth Park, Stevenage, United Kingdom, and again two days later on August 4, 2009 at The Scala in London. The song is regularly performed at the band's concerts.  Personnel Jerry Cantrell – lead vocals, lead guitar William DuVall – backing vocals, rhythm guitar Mike Inez – bass Sean Kinney – drums Production Mastering – Ted Jensen Mixing – Randy Staub  Chart performance "Check My Brain" has become one of the band's most commercially successful singles of their career, especially on rock radio. This was their second number-one on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, after 1994's "No Excuses". It became their first number-one song on the Alternative Songs chart and also topped Billboard's Hot Rock Songs chart, which combines mainstream and alternative rock airplay. "Check My Brain" debuted at number 99 of the Hot 100 on the chart issue of October 3, 2009, peaking at number 92. In addition, it charted on the Canadian Hot 100, reaching number 62.

Jakob Sigismund Beck (originally Jacob Sigismund Beck; 6 August 1761 – 29 August 1840) was a German philosopher.  Biography Beck was born in the village of Liessau (Lisewo) in the rural district of Marienburg (Malbork) in Royal Prussia, Poland in 1761. The son of a priest (of Liessau), he studied (after 1783) mathematics and philosophy at the University of Königsberg, where Christian Jakob Kraus, Johann Schultz, and Immanuel Kant were his teachers. After his studies he first accepted a post as a teacher at a grammar school in Halle. With his thesis Dissertatio de Theoremate Tayloriano, sive de lege generali, secundum quam functionis mutantur, notatis a quibus pendent variabilibus, which he wrote in Halle, he was qualified as a university lecturer. He then worked as a lecturer of philosophy at the University of Halle (1791–1799), before he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Rostock. He devoted himself to criticism and explanation of the doctrine of Kant, and in 1793 published the Erläuternder Auszug aus den kritischen Schriften des Herrn Prof. Kant, auf Anrathen desselben (Riga, 1793–1796), which has been widely used as a compendium of Kantian doctrine. Beck endeavoured to explain away certain of the contradictions which are found in Kant's system by saying that much of the language is used in a popular sense for the sake of intelligibility, e.g. where Kant attributes to things-in-themselves an existence under the conditions of time, space and causality, and yet holds that they furnish the material of our apprehensions. Beck maintains that the real meaning of Kant's theory is idealism; that knowledge of objects outside the domain of consciousness is impossible, and hence that nothing positive remains when we have removed the subjective element. Matter is deduced by the original synthesis. Similarly, the idea of God is a symbolic representation of the voice of conscience guiding from within. The value of Beck's exegesis has been to a great extent overlooked owing to the greater attention given to the work of J. G. Fichte. Beside the three volumes of the Erläuternder Auszug, he published the Grundriss der kritischen Philosophie (1796), containing an interpretation of the Kantian Kritik in the manner of Salomon Maimon. Beck died in Rostock.

The Tour de Yorkshire was a road cycling race in the historic county of Yorkshire, England which first took place in May 2015. It was promoted by the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) and was rated as a 2.HC event as part of the UCI Europe Tour. The idea for the race arose as a legacy event following the success of the visit of the 2014 Tour de France to the county. The first two stages of the 2014 Tour, also organised by ASO, from Leeds to Harrogate, and York to Sheffield, were nicknamed Le Tour de Yorkshire. From 2015 to 2017 it was a three-day race but in 2018 it expanded to four days. The race took place in the days before the May Day bank holiday which, in Britain, is on the first Monday in May. The race was to become part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020 but that was cancelled due to COVID-19. The 2021, 2022 and 2023 tours were also cancelled.  History 2015 Taking place from 1–3 May, the route was Bridlington–Scarborough, Selby–York, and Wakefield–Leeds. The overall winner was Lars Petter Nordhaug of Team Sky. Samuel Sánchez (BMC Racing Team) was second and Thomas Voeckler (Team Europcar) was third. Nordhaug also won the points classification and Team Sky won the teams classification. The mountains classification was won by Nicolas Edet (Cofidis).  2016 This took place from 29 April – 1 May (British Cycling had rejected an application by the organisers Welcome to Yorkshire and ASO to increase the race to four days for 2016), and the route was Beverley–Settle, Otley–Doncaster, and Middlesbrough–Scarborough.  2017 The 2017 Tour was on 28–30 April, with starting or finishing places of Bradford, Bridlington, Harrogate, Scarborough, Sheffield and Tadcaster. It was later announced the route would be Bridlington–Scarborough, Tadcaster–Harrogate and Bradford–Sheffield with the women's race on the Tadcaster–Harrogate section.  2018 The tour was extended to four days running from Thursday 3 May to Sunday 6 May. On 28 September 2017, the start and finish points of the stages were announced as Barnsley, Beverley, Doncaster, Halifax, Ilkley, Leeds, Richmond, and Scarborough. It was later announced that the stages would be Beverley–Doncaster, Barnsley–Ilkley, Richmond–Scarborough and Halifax–Leeds, the women's race would be on part of the first two stages. It is estimated that this year's event bought in £98 million to the Yorkshire economy.  2019 In October 2018, it was announced that Barnsley, Bedale, Bridlington, Doncaster, Halifax, Leeds, Scarborough and Selby would all be either start or finish points for the stages in the tour of 2019. At the same time, it was revealed that Redcar would be a host town in 2020.  In the same month, the world governing body for the sport (UCI), announced that the tour had been upgraded to HC status, the highest status for a multi-stage race which is not part of the world tour. Sir Gary Verity, the race organiser and chair of Welcome to Yorkshire said That's a great honour for us to get the upgrade to HC, that's one below world tour status. To have hors categorie for our race, there are not many races in the world that in such a short space of time have gone from not existing to getting HC status. That's almost unprecedented so we're really, really pleased about that. In December 2018, the stages were announced as running from Thursday 2 May to Sunday 5 May 2019; Doncaster–Selby (stage one; The Heritage Stage), Barnsley–Bedale (stage two; The World Stage), Bridlington–Scarborough (stage three; The Yorkshire Coast) and Halifax–Leeds (stage four; The Yorkshire Classic). The women's stages would be Barnsley–Bedale (stage one) and Bridlington–Scarborough (stage two).  2020 to 2022 The 2020 tour was scheduled to run from 30 April to 3 May with stages from Beverley to Redcar, Skipton to Leyburn, Barnsley to Huddersfield and Halifax to Leeds. The 2020 tour was cancelled in March 2020,  due to the coronavirus outbreak in the United Kingdom. The 2021 Tour was cancelled in November 2020 and the 2022 Tour was cancelled in August 2021.  Future After Welcome to Yorkshire went into administration, the future of the event was put into question. The rights to the race were bought at auction, as part of a package of assets, by  the company Silicon Dales. The Managing Director of Silicon Dales said it was hoped to get the race running again for the 10th anniversary of the 2014 Yorkshire Grand Depart in 2024. Subsequent negotiations between the new owners of Welcome to Yorkshire and ASO to revive the Tour de Yorkshire for 2024 failed, but there are still hopes for a similar event to continue the race's legacy in 2024.  Impact The Tour de Yorkshire has had a significant benefit to Yorkshire in terms of monetary gain and exposure to the world. In 2015 it generated £50 million for the Yorkshire economy, £60 million in 2016, £64 million in 2017, £98 million in 2018, and £60 million in 2019. It was estimated that the broadcast coverage of the event in 2017 was viewed by 9.7 million people across the world with over 2 million spectators lining the route. The 2018 Tour attracted crowds of about 2.6 million people, which The Times newspaper estimated to be the largest spectator event in the United Kingdom. The spectators who lined the route spent 54% more on hospitality than on the previous TdY from 2017. Welcome to Yorkshire was reported to be in talks with the organisers of the Vuelta, in the hope to bring that road cycling event to Yorkshire in the future. During its 80-year history, the event has only held a stage outside of Spain three times before.

Upsala is an unincorporated community and geographic township in Thunder Bay District in northwestern Ontario, Canada. It is located along the Trans-Canada Highway, Highway 17, 142 kilometres (88 mi) west of Thunder Bay, part of the Unorganized Thunder Bay District. It was named after the city of Uppsala in Sweden. When established in 1882, Upsala was an important fuel and water stop for trains travelling on the then newly constructed Canadian Pacific Railway system. The Upsala area is  situated just north of Lac des Mille Lacs, which was an important fur trade waterway and today is home to many fishing and hunting resorts.  History The town of Upsala, in Northwestern Ontario, was established in 1882 in the township of Upsala, to serve as a station stop on the new Canadian Pacific Railway.  It took its name from the township, which in turn was named for the Swedish city of Uppsala, reflecting the Nordic background of many area immigrants. In 1914 a survey of the township was completed, but the planned settlement was interrupted by the outbreak of World War One.  The area was finally opened for settlement in 1922, at the request of employees of the Canadian Pacific Railway, who appreciated its possibilities. Pioneer settlers included Hans Nordal, H.D. Wiseman, Hugo Carlson, C. Nordstrom, S. Kenuck, O. Hakanson, A. Greenland, G.R. Johnston and Elmer and Esther Aho.  The first school in the town was established in 1925.  Sybil Nordal was one of the pupils in the first class.  Entertainment revolved around the “house party set”: neighbours who gathered in each other’s homes or at the schoolhouse to dance to the fiddle.  A forest fire in 1928 threatened the township and burned the Aho home. The Women’s Institute was organized by Mrs. D.B. Frazer in 1935 with charter members Mrs. Kailik and Mrs. Greenlund.  In 1939 the Agricultural Society was established in a hall located half a mile east of Upsala on property owned by C. McGuire.  The society arranged to purchase fertilizer in quantity at low prices, and sponsored potato growing competitions.  Mr. Harrison, the proprietor of the Victoria Hotel in Fort William, donated a cup called the Harrison Trophy which became the property of three time winner, Harold Johnston, the son of pioneer farmers. By the 1930s the town consisted of many homes on both sides of the tracks and alongside roads. Until 1937, when the highway went in, there were no roads in the centre of town, just paths between the buildings on the north and south sides of the CPR tracks.  The station and pump house and the Catholic church were north of the tracks, with the cemetery further back.  To the south there was the Upsala Inn, J.R. Ellat Store, SS#1 (the school), the community hall and Lake Milton.  Mail and supplies were delivered to the station on trains as they came through. Until 1937, all travel to the town was by rail.  Then a section of the Trans-Canada Highway was built on the site of a wagon trail in the town, connecting it to the twin cities of Fort William and Port Arthur (now one city, Thunder Bay).   == References ==

The Demographic Window is defined to be that period of time in a nation's demographic evolution when the proportion of population of working age group is particularly prominent. This occurs when the demographic architecture of a population becomes younger and the percentage of people able to work reaches its height. Typically, the demographic window of opportunity lasts for 30–40 years depending upon the country. Because of the mechanical link between fertility levels and age structures, the timing and duration of this period is closely associated to those of fertility decline: when birth rates fall, the age pyramid first shrinks with gradually lower proportions of young population (under 15s) and the dependency ratio decreases as is happening (or happened) in various parts of East Asia over several decades. After a few decades, low fertility however causes the population to get older and the growing proportion of elderly people inflates again the dependency ratio as is observed in present-day Europe. The exact technical boundaries of definition may vary. The UN Population Department has defined it as period when the proportion of children and youth under 15 years falls below 30 per cent and the proportion of people 65 years and older is still below 15 per cent. The Global Data Lab released an alternative classification of phases:  Europe's demographic window lasted from 1950 to 2000. It began in China in 1990 and is expected to last until 2015. India is expected to enter the demographic window in 2010, which may last until the middle of the present century. Much of Africa will not enter the demographic window until 2045 or later. Societies who have entered the demographic window have smaller dependency ratio (ratio of dependents to working-age population) and therefore the demographic potential for high economic growth as favorable dependency ratios tend to boost savings and investments in human capital. But this so-called "demographic bonus" (or demographic dividend) remains only a potential advantage as low participation rates (for instance among women) or rampant unemployment may limit the impact of favorable age structures.

Yepp was Samsung Electronics' digital audio player brand until Samsung decided to retire most of their family brands in February 2011. From then on, their MP3 players were simply branded "Samsung" worldwide until they discontinued all of them in late 2013. The brand included a wide range of hard-drive based as well as flash-memory based players. The name is claimed to be an acronym for "young, energetic, passionate person".  History The Yepp brand was first introduced at CES 1999 in Las Vegas where the first Samsung mp3 players have been unveiled (YP-E, YP-B and YP-D series). Samsung MP3 players were branded "Yepp" worldwide until 2003. From then Samsung only kept this brand for the Korean market while the players sold in the rest of the world were simply branded "Samsung". Samsung finally dropped the Yepp brand in Korea too since 2011. Even though it has disappeared for 10 years in Europe and America, it is still common among the users to refer to the Samsung MP3 players as "Yepp". As of November 2013, Samsung discontinued their MP3 players line in most countries. Only the YP-W1 and YP-U7 are still available in some countries. The Galaxy Players series has also been discontinued in most countries. Samsung released the successor to the YP-GI1, the YP-GI2 (Galaxy 070) only in Korea in August 2013. Samsung shut down all official MP3 players dedicated websites and blogs in Korea and worldwide. As of December 2016, Samsung discontinued their MP3 players and Android-based Galaxy Players lines worldwide. Even though Samsung never announced officially they would stop producing MP3 players, it appears they actually did.  Comparison of models The naming scheme of Samsung players has always been the same. For example, YP-P2JEB, where J stands for Janus (MTP models, no letter if UMS), E stands for 16 GB (V:256 MB; X:512 MB; Z:1 GB; Q:2 GB; A:4 GB; C:8 GB; E:16 GB; N:32 GB) and B stands for Black (W:White; P:Pink; S:Silver etc.). On some models, an R indicates RDS support (for example: YP-F2R) or an F indicates an FM tuner (example: YP-Z5F); however, some models with the feature do not have the suffix. Some Samsung MP3 players, including YH-820/920/925, YP-R0, YP-R1, and YP-Z5 are partly or fully supported by Rockbox.  Discontinued models Country-specific models Yepp R Series The R series was introduced in 2009 with the YP-R0 and the YP-R1. The YP-R2 released in 2011 is the successor to the YP-R1 but the YP-R1 is not the successor to the YP-R0, which makes Samsung's naming scheme difficult to understand.  YP-R0 YP-R1 YP-R2 Yepp S Series YP-S2 The YP-S2 is a screen-less MP3 player shaped like a pebble with tactile buttons on its underside.  YP-S3 The S3 is an MP3 player with a rounded-edges design similar to that of the YP-T9, but having a touchpad like the YP-T10. Unlike the YP-S5, it only supports Samsung's own video format (.svi) when playing videos.  YP-S5 MP4 player with 2, 4 or 8 GB capacity and built-in slide-out stereo speaker. The S5 supports MPEG4, JPEG, MP3, AAC and WMA. Bluetooth.  Yepp Q Series YP-Q1 Diamond Newer version of T10, has 2.4" screen, but doesn't have bluetooth.

Some of the features on this device include Bluetooth stereo headphone compatibility with support for multiple sets of headphones and also sports Bluetooth phone connectivity with the ability to use your stereo headphones with your cellphone and speak through the built-in microphone on the player itself. The player also supports file transfers via Bluetooth. Another feature is the drag-and-drop interface for uploading music to YP-P2 which makes it easy interface to managing your media collection.  YP-P3 Successor to Samsung P2 and was released in May 2009 in 8, 16, 32 GB. It has haptic feedback and menu customization with multiple pages and widgets. It supports many more video codecs including DIVX within an AVI container, in addition to H.264 video. The newest firmware, version 2.18 (Released even newer Version now 2.22) allows it support resolutions up to 800x600. Compared to the P2, it has a much better build quality, and its back is made of aluminum, which is much more scratch resistant to the P2's painted-metal back. In addition, it has a glass screen which is far less prone to scratches; a test conducted on anythinGButipod.com showed that even a knife couldn't scratch the screen at all. It also may arrive broken so take your chances with this model  Yepp U Series The Yepp U series is a famous line of USB key MP3 players introduced in 2005 with the YP-U1. The latest one YP-U7 was released in 2012. All U players have a similar USB key form factor with a 1" 128x64 screen. They all support MP3, WMA and OGG files but some devices support more codecs.

MTP based. Was replaced in 2007 by the smaller YP-S5.  Yepp T Series YP-T08 The Samsung 08 was released only in China, and is exactly the same as the T10, but has longer battery life and a new UI, replacing Sammy character.  YP-T10 The Samsung T10 is a flash memory (2, 4 and 8 GB) based Yepp portable media player (model name YP-T10) produced and developed by Samsung Electronics. As the newest player of the T series, the T10 abandons using the controls of the T9, but adapts the K3's. The Samsung T10 supports Bluetooth, allowing use of a Bluetooth headset. From firmware version 2.00 it can also exchange files with other Bluetooth devices. This includes mobile phones, allowing the user to speak directly into the T10 using it as a kind of remote handset.

Older players had the YEPP logo on the faceplate, while later models had just the SAMSUNG logo. Storage capacities include: 128 MB, 256 MB, 512 MB, and 1 GB, although the US did not receive the base 128 MB model. It connects to a computer with a USB cable to charge the 10-hour (claimed) lithium-polymer battery and transfer files. It supports the MP3, WMA (and WMA DRM), WAV, ASF, and Ogg formats. It can receive and record FM broadcasts, and supports voice recording. The size is 1.14" x 2.5" x 0.6".  YP-Z5(F) Z5(F) is a flash-based digital audio player, made by Samsung Electronics. The interface for Z5(F), which implements transparency effects, was designed by Paul Mercer's Iventor software design company. Paul Mercer previously founded Pixo, the creator of the iPod's operating system.  The Z5F has some features, such as an FM radio and a dictaphone, not provided on the Z5. To celebrate the sale of one million Z5Fs, Samsung auctioned 10 gold-plated Z5Fs in Korea.  The player has the re-designed YEPP logo. According to a firmware release schedule on the official YEPP website, Z5(F) should have received a text-file reader on 30 December 2006. The firmware for a text reader was instead released in September 2007 (version 2.51). The player was expected to support video playback, but this feature was not included in the official release, pending further testing. The feature was expected to be implemented with a later firmware release.  YH-999 also known as YEPP Portable Media Center This player had a 3.5″ screen and with the Portable Media Center interface.  YP-D1 This flash-memory Audio player has a maximum of 2 GB storage. It supports WMA, MP3 and Ogg Vorbis. It can play back videos on its 1.8″ TFT-LCD and features a 2-megapixel camera with flash. It can display text files and has USB hosting functions. It is almost exactly the same as the Samsung yp-t8, except it has a camera instead of the motion sensing games. Otherwise, it is the same.  YP-910 This player has a monochrome screen and was originally manufactured for Napster, bearing both the Napster and the Samsung logos. The YP-910 weighs 6 ounces and measures about 4.25″ by 2.5″ by 0.75″—a "shirt pocket" form, like most PDAs. The player controls limit the user to only simple actions. It provides 20 GB hard-disk space and can play MP3, WMA, and WMA-DRM. However, audio quality was reported to be mediocre. It can record from the internal FM radio or from line-in, and has a built-in FM modulator. Playback time using the internal lithium-polymer battery is up to 10 hours, but may be decreased by transmitter use, playback volume and audio files with high bit rates. For transferring files to the player, a special version of the Napster 2.0 software that contains the device drivers has to be installed. After that, it is supposedly possible to maintain its content either via Napster or Windows Media Player. The unit was tied into Napster's DRM, which made it impossible to re-upload purchased files to another PC. Downloading more than 4,000 tracks to the device can destroy its internal library, so that its disk space cannot be used properly in most cases.  YP-55 Originally released in 2003, the YP-55 is a flash-memory based player featuring a rotating top which operates the Fast-Forward/Rewind functions and prevents accidental usage. It was available with built-in memory sizes of 128 MB (YP-55H), 192 MB (YP-55I – sold only in Canada), 256 MB (YP-55V) and 512 MB (YP-55X). It contains a recorder for voice, radio or line-in. The firmware is upgradeable, and can also be user modified with various programs to change things such as the button mapping and graphics. The latest firmware (version 7.300) allows for many new features, including play lists and the ability to remember its place in four different files at once. The latter feature makes it more suitable for audio books, as it makes searching for where one left off unnecessary. The original YP-55 models came with a gray cloth case, later models used a plastic case which allows access to all the controls without opening it.  YP-60 Announced in 2004, this was one of the first sports-oriented players released by Samsung. The player is contained in a black and orange rubberized plastic housing. Sports features such as, heart-rate monitor, calorie counter, and stop watch are included on this player. In-box accessories include: a 2.5 mm adapter, sweat-proof ear phones and an arm band. It also utilizes a non-standard 2.5mm headphone jack, line-in encoding, and FM recordings. It was released in two capacities: 128 MB (YP-60) and 256 MB (YP-60V).  YP-D40 This player was also sold by Creative as the first Creative NOMAD.  YP-35 A flash-based MP3 player with 64 MB (YP-35) or 128 MB (YP-35H) memory and a voice recorder function.  YH-J70 A bulky hard-drive based MP3 audio player which comes in 20G and 30G capacities. Its rated battery life is 25 hours of audio and 5 hours of video. One of the first video mp3 players made, it was released a few months before the iPod Video. The player has an FM Radio, text viewer, video viewer, USB host, and 5 default games.  YP-300S/H Released in 2002, the Samsung YP-300S MP3 player offers 2X MP3 technology, allowing you to maximize the memory space inside your Yepp. With 64 MB of built-in memory and a Smart Memory card slot for expandable storage, the YP300S offers hours of music playback. Features include 2X MP3 - MP3 Compression technology that allows you to downsize your MP3 files via supplied software, 64 MB of memory, Multi-format player - MP3 and WMA, Upgradeable firmware, Smart Memory card slot for expandable storage, Backlight LCD screen, 15 hours of playback time (2 AAA Batteries). Samsung YP-300H is the same player, but instead with a built-in 128 MB media (Flash) storage.  YP-E32/E64 Released in 1999, this flash-memory audio player has a maximum of 64 mb storage (YP-E64), but also came in a 32 mb version. The memory could be upgraded with SmartMedia. It supports MP3 music, which was originally transferred using a parallel cable (later changed to USB 1.0). It came with a multi-line non-backlit LCD screen, which could display three lines of text as well as icons on a top row. The front of the device was made of aluminium and the back and buttons plastic. It featured a voice recorder, phone book and EQ settings.

Glenn Clarence Cunningham (September 10, 1912 – December 18, 2003) was an American Republican politician. He was born in Omaha, Nebraska on September 10, 1912 and graduated from the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 1935.  He sold insurance for a while.  From 1946 to 1948 he was a member of the Omaha board of education and a member of Omaha city council from 1947 to 1948.  He was elected  Mayor of Omaha from 1949 to 1954. He was a delegate to the 1948 Republican National Convention and to the 1952 Republican National Convention.  He was elected as a Republican to the Eighty-fifth United States Congress and to the six succeeding Congresses  serving from January 3, 1957 to January 3, 1971. Cunningham voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but did not vote on the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He lost his bid for renomination to the Ninety-second United States Congress in 1970 to then Douglas County Commissioner John Y. McCollister.  He died on December 18, 2003, in Omaha.  He was a member of the Episcopalian church and of Pi Kappa Alpha. Glenn Cunningham Lake was named for Cunningham.  References  "Cunningham, Glenn Clarence". The Political Graveyard.

A walking day is a type of church parade. Walking days are most common in North West England, where they are an annual event for many towns and villages. In some rural communities in the North West they are known as Field Days, Gala Days or Club Days. There may be several churches involved in a local walking day, however, most 'church' walking days are held individually for each church (the Walking Days in Warrington are a notable exception to this as they all benefit from the participation of multiple churches from many denominations). The churches hire bands to provide music: for instance brass bands, pipe bands and marching bands. The police provide an escort and control the road traffic, but some police forces are now refusing to provide escorts out of public funds, and this may threaten many of these traditional events. Children play a big part through their churches, schools, the Boys' Brigade, the Scouts and the Girl Guides. Non-church processions are often led by a young lady, who has been crowned the "Rose Queen" for the year. The Queen may be particular to a church but can represent the whole village too. Indeed, some Rose Queens and May Queens have festivals of their own. For example, there is the "Lymm May Queen", "Knutsford May Queen" and the "Thelwall Rose Queen" Walking days are particularly common in the Warrington, St Helens, Prescot and Wigan areas. They are held annually in most districts, including:  Grappenhall Orford Padgate Penketh Stockton Heath Stretton Warrington Winwick Rainford Ashton-in-Makerfield Haydock Newton le Willows Croft Some walking days, including those held in Warrington, Orford, Padgate, Stockton Heath and Stretton, are followed by a fair. A particular feature of the walks is that the spectators lining the streets, when they see children they know walking in the parade, will run out into the road and give the children money. The children often use the money collected in this way to spend on the fair later in the day. Warrington Walking Day itself dates back to 1834, and is perhaps the largest in terms of attendance and participation. Churches now walk in ecumenical groups from each area. Most businesses in the town used to close for the day, but as Warrington has expanded, many firms have national and international business that demands attention. A detailed history of Warrington Walking Day can be found in the University of Sheffield National Fairground Archive.   == References ==

Jean-François Clouet (11 November 1751 – 4 July 1801) was a French chemist and metallurgist. His notable works include the liquefaction of sulphur dioxide in collaboration with Gaspard Monge and the production of Damascus and cast steel. Clouet was born in Singly, Ardennes, son of farmer Norbert and Marie-Jeanne Tayaut. Educated at Charleville and at the École du Génie at Mézières he travelled around the country before setting up a pottery workshop where he experimented with enamels. He gave this up in 1783 and became a teacher at the École du Génie where he began to collaborate with Gaspard Monge, conducting experiments on the composition of water, liquefaction of sulphur dioxide under low temperature and high pressure (in 1784) and on balloon flight. He took over Monge's position the next year and began to examine metallurgy, with experiments on siderite, and the manufacture of Damascus steel. He also examined the composition of Prussian Blue in 1791. After the French Revolution, in which he participated, in 1793, he was called by Jean-Nicolas Pache to improve metallurgy and worked at several places including the École Polytechnique and Conservatoire des Arts et Métier. He established the foundry at Daigny. In 1795 he claimed to have produced Damascus steel by the addition of diamonds to molten iron. This method of hardening steel was later replaced by graphite by others. He also found a way to cast steel by melting cast iron with chalk and charcoal. He was honoured at the Exposition des produits de l'industrie française of September 1798. He also began to make experiments on plant chemicals. Clouet was a friend of Claude Henri de Saint-Simon and became interested in reformism and Rousseanism. In 1799 he decided to move to Guiana where he wished to examined tropical plants. He died from a fever at Cayenne.  Some early biographers of Clouet have confounded him with two others Abbé Pierre-Romain Clouet (1748–1810), a librarian at the Ecole des Mines, and Jean-Baptiste-Paul-Antoine Clouet (1739–1816), who worked with Lavoisier.   == References ==

The 74181 is a 4-bit slice arithmetic logic unit (ALU), implemented as a 7400 series TTL integrated circuit. Introduced by Texas Instruments in February 1970, it was the first complete ALU on a single chip. It was used as the arithmetic/logic core in the CPUs of many historically significant minicomputers and other devices. The 74181 represents an evolutionary step between the CPUs of the 1960s, which were constructed using discrete logic gates, and today's single-chip microprocessor CPUs. Although no longer used in commercial products, the 74181 is still referenced in computer organization textbooks and technical papers. It is also sometimes used in "hands-on" college courses to train future computer architects.  Specifications The 74181 is a 7400 series medium-scale integration (MSI) TTL integrated circuit, containing the equivalent of 75 logic gates and most commonly packaged as a 24-pin DIP. The 4-bit wide ALU can perform all the traditional add / subtract / decrement operations with or without carry, as well as AND / NAND, OR / NOR, XOR, and shift. Many variations of these basic functions are available, for a total of 16 arithmetic and 16 logical operations on two four-bit words. Multiply and divide functions are not provided but can be performed in multiple steps using the shift and add or subtract functions. Shift is not an explicit function but can be derived from several available functions; e.g., selecting function "A plus A" with carry (M=0) will give an  arithmetic left shift of the A input. The 74181 performs these operations on two four-bit operands generating a four-bit result with carry in 22 nanoseconds (45 MHz). The 74S181 performs the same operations in 11 nanoseconds (90 MHz), while the 74F181 performs the operations in 7 nanoseconds (143 MHz) (typical). Multiple 'slices' can be combined for arbitrarily large word sizes. For example, sixteen 74S181s and five 74S182 look ahead carry generators can be combined to perform the same operations on 64-bit operands in 28 nanoseconds (36 MHz). Although overshadowed by the performance of today's multi-gigahertz 64-bit microprocessors, this was quite impressive when compared to the sub-megahertz clock speeds of the early four- and eight-bit microprocessors.  Implemented functions The 74181 implements all 16 possible logical functions with two variables.  Its arithmetic functions include addition and subtraction with and without carry. It can be used with data in active-high (high corresponds to 1) and active-low (low corresponds to 1) logic levels.  Inputs and outputs There are four selection inputs, S0 to S3, to select the function. M is used to select between logical and arithmetic operation, and Cn is the carry-in. A and B is the data to be processed (four bits). F is the number output.  There are also P and a G signals for a carry-lookahead adder, which can be implemented via one or several 74182 chips.  Function table for output F In the following table, AND is denoted as a product, OR with a                         +                 {\displaystyle +}     sign, XOR with                         ⊕                 {\displaystyle \oplus }    , logical NOT with an overbar and arithmetic plus and minus using the words plus and minus.  Significance The 74181 greatly simplified the development and manufacture of computers and other devices that required high speed computation during the 1970s through the early 1980s, and is still referenced as a "classic" ALU design. Prior to the introduction of the 74181, computer CPUs occupied multiple circuit boards and even very simple computers could fill multiple cabinets. The 74181 allowed an entire CPU and in some cases, an entire computer to be constructed on a single large printed circuit board. The 74181 occupies a historically significant stage between older CPUs based on discrete logic functions spread over multiple circuit boards and modern microprocessors that incorporate all CPU functions in a single chip. The 74181 was used in various minicomputers and other devices beginning in the 1970s, but as microprocessors became more powerful the practice of building a CPU from discrete components fell out of favour and the 74181 was not used in any new designs.  Today By 1994, CPU designs based on the 74181 were not commercially viable due to the comparatively low price and high performance of microprocessors. However, the 74181 is still of interest in the teaching of computer organization and CPU design because it provides opportunities for hands-on design and experimentation that are rarely available to students.

Yerson Candelo Miranda (born 24 February 1992) is a Colombian footballer who plays as a right winger for brazilian Série A club Criciúma.  Club career Deportivo Cali Candelo joined Deportivo Cali's youth academy at a young age and made his professional debut in 2010.  Queretaro In 2015, Deportivo Cali and Queretaro reached terms for the 3 million dollar transfer of Candelo to "Los Gallos Blancos."  Atletico Nacional On 20 June 2018 he signed for  Atlético Nacional. On 1 November 2018, Candelo won his first title with the club, the 2018 Copa Colombia. On 22 June, in the first leg of the 2022 Apertura finals against Deportes Tolima, Candelo scored a long range goal from the middle of the pitch, to put his team 2-1 up in an eventual 3-1 win. This goal was recognized as FIFA as a potential Puskas Award candidate. Nacional later won the finals 4-3 on aggregate, with Candelo participating in the second leg.  In February 2023, he won his third title with the club, after Nacional won the 2023 Superliga Colombiana 5-3 on aggregate against Deportivo Pereira, with Candelo participating as a substitute in the first leg. Shortly after the 2023 Apertura finals, which Nacional lost to rivals Millonarios, Nacional terminated Candelo's contract. It was rumored that this decision was taken because of a situation that happened in the closing minutes of the second leg of the finals, where mainly Candelo and Dorlan Pabón prevented two substitutions, against the decisions of manager Paulo Autuori, whose idea was to bring these players on for the penalty shootout. However, Candelo states that he never had anything to do with the substitutions, and that the club said they wanted to prioritize their younger players.  Aucas On 30 July 2023, Candelo joined Ecuadorian side Aucas, after heavy interest from Millonarios. Candelo scored one goal in a 4-0 victory against Mushuc Runa in the Liga Pro.  Criciúma After a season with Aucas, Candelo signed for recently promoted brazilian side Criciúma.  International career Candelo made his debut for the Colombia national team on 16 January 2022 in a 2–1 home win over Honduras.

Larix gmelinii, the Dahurian larch or Gmelin larch, is a species of larch native to eastern Siberia and adjacent northeastern Mongolia, northeastern China (Heilongjiang), South Korea and North Korea.  Description Larix gmelinii is a medium-sized deciduous coniferous tree reaching 10–30 m tall, rarely 40 m, with a trunk up to 1 m diameter. The crown is broad conic; both the main branches and the side branches are level, the side branches only rarely drooping. The shoots are dimorphic, with growth divided into long shoots (typically 5–30 cm long) and bearing several buds, and short shoots only 1–2 mm long with only a single bud. The leaves are needle-like, light green, 2–3 cm long; they turn bright yellow to orange before they fall in the autumn, leaving the variably downy reddish-brown shoots bare until the next spring. The cones are erect, ovoid, 1–2 cm (rarely 2.5 cm) long, with 15–25 moderately reflexed seed scales; they are green (rarely purple) when immature, turning brown and opening to release the seeds when mature, 3–5 months after pollination. The old cones commonly remain on the tree for many years, turning dull grey-black.  Taxonomy and systematics The scientific name honours Johann Georg Gmelin. Due to the species' variability, it has acquired numerous synonyms in the botanical literature, including L. cajanderi, L. dahurica, L. kamtschatica, L. komarovii, L. kurilensis, L. lubarskii, L. ochotensis. Dahurian larch intergrades with the closely related Siberian larch L. sibirica of central and western Siberia where their ranges meet along the Yenisei Valley; the resulting hybrid is named Larix × czekanowskii.  Varieties As of April 2022, Plants of the World Online accepts four varieties:  Larix gmelinii var. gmelinii. Most of the species' range, from the Yenisei Valley east to Kamchatka. Larix gmelinii var. japonica. The Kuril Islands and Sakhalin. Larix gmelinii var. olgensis. North Korea, Heilongjiang, and the Sikhote-Alin mountains of Primorsky Krai, Russia. Sometimes treated as a distinct species Larix olgensis. Larix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii (Prince Rupprecht's larch), syn. Larix principis-rupprechtii. It occurs in a disjunct region in the Wutai Shan mountains west of Beijing, separated from typical L. gmelinii by about 1000 km, and differs in having larger (2–4 cm) cones with more scales.  Ecology and uses Larix gmelinii forms enormous forests in the eastern Siberian taiga, growing at 50–1,200 m altitude on both boggy and well-drained soils, including on the shallow soils above permafrost. It is unique in two respects, being the northernmost tree in the world, reaching 73° 04' 32" N 102° E as creeping forms of the trees in the tundra of the Taymyr Peninsula, 72° 55' 07" N 106° 08' E as comparatively vertical growing single trees and small groups of trees, 72° 31' N  105° 03' E at Lukunsky grove and 72° 28' N 102° 15' E at Ary-Mas as the subtundra sparse forests which are situated both in the Taymyr Peninsula, Khatanga river basin, and also the most cold-hardy tree in the world, tolerating temperatures below -70 °C in the Oymyakon–Verkhoyansk region of Yakutia. One tree in Yakutia was recorded as being 919 years old. Dahurian larch is occasionally grown in botanical gardens in Europe and North America; it is not an easy tree to grow in areas with mild winters as it is adapted to a long period of winter rest; the warm winter weather in Britain can tempt it into leaf as early as the start of January, with the tender young leaves then being killed by the next frost. In its native region, daily minimum temperatures above freezing do not occur until late May or June, with no further frost until the brief summer is over.  Larix gmelinii cone scales are used as food by the caterpillars of the tortrix moth Cydia illutana.

Baron Emmanuel Leo Ludwig 'Toulo' de Graffenried (18 May 1914, Paris, France – 22 January 2007, Lonay, Switzerland) was a Swiss motor racing driver. He participated in 23 World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 13 May 1950, and scored a total of nine championship points. He also participated in numerous non-Championship Formula One races. De Graffenried was born in Paris, the son of Swiss Baron Leo de Graffenried and his American wife Irma Stern. He began his racing career in 1936, driving his own Maserati voiturette. Some of his most memorable results came at his home track: the challenging, cobbled, street circuit at Bremgarten near Bern. He won the 1949 British Grand Prix, a year before the FIA World Championship began. In that inaugural year, de Graffenried contested four of the season's seven races, with mixed results. He continued to drive in occasional races over the next six years, with his best finish being fourth place at the 1953 Belgian Grand Prix. Following his retirement from racing, de Graffenried managed his car dealership in Lausanne, featuring Alfa Romeo, Rolls-Royce and Ferrari automobiles. He also acted as stunt double for Kirk Douglas during the filming of The Racers. Later, he became a common figure at Formula One events during the 1970s and 1980s, as the corporate ambassador for Phillip Morris' Marlboro cigarette brand. In recognition of his win at the first British Grand Prix, de Graffenried made his last appearance at the wheel of a racing car during the 1998 celebrations of Silverstone's 50th anniversary at age 84. He was the last surviving driver to have competed in the first World Championship Formula One Grand Prix.

John Wesley Moon (January 18, 1836 – April 5, 1898) was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. Moon was born in Wayne County, Michigan, near Ypsilanti, and attended the common schools. As a youth, he worked on a farm and attended school during the winter. In 1852, he moved to Jackson County and left there in the fall of 1854 to work in lumber camps and saw mills on the Flat River in central Michigan. In the spring of 1856, he settled in Muskegon County, Michigan, and engaged in the manufacture of lumber and in banking.  He was a partner in the firm of A.V. Mann & Co., which established a mill at Lakeside (now a part of the city of Muskegon). He held the offices of supervisor, township treasurer, and president of the then village of Muskegon. He served in the Michigan Senate in 1885, from the 23rd district, and in 1887, from the 21st district. Also in 1887, he was elected president of the Muskegon Savings Bank. A few years later, in 1891, he became a member of the board of education of Muskegon. In 1892, Moon was elected as a Republican from Michigan's 9th congressional district to the 53rd Congress, defeating incumbent Democrat Harrison H. Wheeler. Moon served from March 4, 1893, to March 3, 1895, and was not a candidate for re-nomination in 1894. After leaving Congress, John W. Moon resumed his former business activities. He died in Muskegon and is interred there at Evergreen Cemetery.  References United States Congress. "John W. Moon (id: M000885)". Biographical Directory of the United States Congress.

Crawford Street Bridge is one of two known bridges that once spanned over Garrison Creek valley — the actual creek disappeared as brick sewer by the 1920s) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and buried intact in the 20th century. The bridge shares design features with the larger Prince Edward Viaduct. The Crawford Bridge was a triple span Arch bridge built in 1914 to 1915 to replace an early wooden bridge (1884) that spanned Garrison Creek in the area known today as Trinity-Bellwoods. The bridge's design was influenced by Public Works Commissioner Roland Caldwell Harris with a more pleasing structure for the public. The bridge was built to allow residents in the new residential development along Crawford Street to cross over the valley over from north of Lobb Avenue to the south of Dundas Street West. In the 1960s the valley on either side was filled in with earth dug from building the Bloor subway. It was the last of few bridges that spanned Garrison Creek to be removed, most before the 1940s. The actual bridge was not torn down, but rather buried with only the railings and lamp posts removed. The City of Toronto government performed maintenance work in 2004 that narrowed the roadbed and rebuilt sidewalks on both sides. Foaming grout was added to fill the voids of the bridge with hope for future restoration of the entire bridge. Today there are no visible signs of the bridge being present other than plaques and sidewalk markers added in 2008 by the City of Toronto.

Ali Haydar (Arabic: علي حيدر‎; 1932 – 5 August 2022), known as the "Father of the Syrian Special Forces", was a Syrian military officer who was the commander of the Syrian Special Forces for 26 years. He was a close confidant to President Hafez al-Assad and one of the members of Assad's inner circle. Born in the village of Hallet Ara, Haydar was a member of the Ba'ath Party from his youth. He was commissioned into the Syrian Army in 1952 after a stint studying at the Homs Military Academy. After the Ba'ath Party seized power in a 1963 coup d'état, Haydar was put in charge of Syria's special forces and supported al-Assad in his rise to the presidency. During this time he was deployed to Lebanon during their civil war. Haydar opposed the 1984 coup d'état attempt led by Rifaat al-Assad, instead remaining loyal to Hafez al-Assad. After suffering an aneurysm and leaving his post in 1988, he returned to lead the special forces again in the early 1990s. At the time a Major General, he was formally removed from his position and then imprisoned in August 1994, though he was treated well during his brief prison stay and was released without a trial or public humiliation. Haydar died in Latakia at the age of 90.  Early life and family Haydar was born in 1932 in the village of Hallet Ara, Jableh District, which was then part of the Alawite State set up by the French administration in Syria. It is not quite clear which Alawite tribe Haydar belonged to, and different sources either cite him as being a member of the Khayatin tribe, which is traditionally allied with the Kalbiyya tribe; to which the Assad family belongs. or possibly to the Haddadin tribe, to which Salah Jadid and Hafez al-Assad's wife Anisa Makhlouf belonged. His father was a religious sheikh. His uncle, Ahmad Mohammad Haydar, was also a well-known sheikh who advocated for Alawites to abandon superstitions and blend with mainstream Islam. He was a childhood friend of Hafez al-Assad. Two of his five children married outside the Alawite faith, with his son marrying a Sunni and his daughter marrying a Shiite.  Career Haydar joined the Ba'ath Party of Michel Aflaq as a schoolboy and was commissioned as an infantry officer in the Syrian Army in 1952, after studying at the Homs Military Academy. The Ba'ath Party came to power in Syria following the 1963 Syrian coup d'état. Haydar went on to become the Commander of Syria's Special Forces in 1968 after training at the Soviet airborne forces' academy. Haydar remained close to his childhood friend Hafez al-Assad, and supported him in the 1970 Syrian Corrective Revolution, which brought Hafez to power. Haydar provided military support for Hafez during the coup, helping to oust Salah Jadid and President Nureddin al-Atassi. Haydar remained as Commander of the Special Forces under Hafez, and emerged as a key figure in Hafez's inner circle, and was one of Hafez's most loyal officers. Haydar's high status and membership of a different Alawite tribe helped Hafez consolidate his hold over the Alawite community, which he also maintained through marriage and the appointment of other tribal representatives to high office. Haydar's Special Forces expanded in size to 25,000 men, and formed a key part of the Syrian government's security apparatus. The Special Forces were trained in airborne operations, and were rivaled on power only by the Defense Companies controlled by Hafez's brother, Rifaat. As such, the 14th Division became a strong counter-weight to the Defense Companies, as both these formations were largely airborne divisions. However, the Special Forces lacked the heavy armour and artillery capabilities which Rifaat's forces had. Instead, its specialization was in anti-Tank operations and sniper warfare. Haydar pioneered very aggressive tactics and training, and the Syrian special forces' snipers and their sniper doctrine and tactics acquired a fearsome reputation which persists to this day. Under Haydar, the Special Forces units were deployed to Lebanon as part of the Syrian intervention in the Lebanese Civil War. During the war they engaged with PLO units under the command of Yasser Arafat. Haydar left his command in 1988 following an aneurysm, although later returned to his post in the early 1990s. He totally rejected any form of peace with Israel at the Madrid Conference of 1991. Haydar was deployed to Lebanon in 1982 following the Israeli offensive, with his Special Forces engaging the IDF. The Special Forces played a key role during the war, and were mainly stationed in Bhamdun and Tripoli. They also remained a key component of the Syrian government's defenses against internal and external threats, with units stationed on Mount Qasioun overlooking Damascus, and in the port city of Tartus.  1984 coup attempt Hafez al-Assad fell ill in November 1983, and Rifaat al-Assad began planning a coup to seize the Presidency. Haydar was close to Rifaat, however he fiercely refused when Rifaat asked him to support him in the coup. Haydar reportedly said:  "I recognise no leader in the country other than Hafez al-Assad! What I have of power and prestige I owe to him. I am a soldier in his service and a slave to his beck and call. While I am alive I bear obedience to him and will not fall away from him." Haydar's staunch refusal to partake in any coup reinforced his loyalty in Hafez's eyes. Haydar later confronted Rifaat in March 1984, when Rifaat attempted his coup. The Defense Companies under Rifaat's command began setting up checkpoints and roadblocks in Damascus, began to forcibly occupy State buildings, Police Stations, began to disarm the Police, and even tried to infiltrate his forces into the Defence Ministry HQ. Haydar deployed his Special Forces against the Defense Companies of Rifaat on the streets of Damascus, using his Anti-Tank platoons to directly challenge Rifaat's T-72 Tank units which were threatening government buildings. Haydar also ordered his sniper platoons which were deployed by parachute or from helicopters, to take up key positions near the residences of known Defense Company commanders in order to psychologically terrorize them. Sniper units also tactically besieged the Mezzeh Airbase and some other vital Defense Company bases and installations. Potential civil war was only averted through the action of Hafez, who intervened and placated Rifaat by making him Vice President, before sending him off into exile.  Arrest and retirement Haydar, a Major General, was formally removed from his position as Commander of Syria's Special Forces and then imprisoned on 3 August 1994. Syrian sources talking to the al-Hayat newspaper claimed that Haydar had been imprisoned for failing to follow military orders, although others claimed the arrest followed criticism from Haydar of Hafez al-Assad for recalling Bashar al-Assad to Syria from London, where he was studying, in order to groom him for command following the death of his brother, Basil al-Assad. Haydar seemingly objected to the idea of Hafez's plans to keep succession to the Syrian Presidency within the Assad family. It was also suggested his removal was tied to his previous strong opposition to the peace talks then taking place between Syrian and Israeli envoys in Washington DC. His arrest and imprisonment happened during a restructuring of the Syrian Army designed to remove influential Alawite military leaders and in turn pave the way for the succession of the Presidency from Hafez al-Assad. It was also suggested that Haydar's arrest was accompanied by the arrest of a number of top ranking Alawite officials who either supported Haydar or shared his criticism of Hafez' plans for the Presidency. He was replaced by Maj. Gen. Ali Habib, a member of the Alawite Matawirah clan from Safita. Habib had previously commanded the Seventh Mechanized Division and had led Syrian forces in the 1991 Gulf War. A Jordanian analyst quoted by The Christian Science Monitor suggested Habib was chosen due to having shown himself willing to follow Hafez's orders in the Gulf War, as it showed commitment to Hafez's command over long standing Ba'athist ideological positions against what it saw as Western Imperialism. Despite his detention, Haydar was never brought to trial or publicly humiliated, but was instead well treated in his brief captivity before being released and retired. He remained an important figure in the Syrian Ba'ath Party and the Syrian Army until Hafez's death in 2000. He attended Hafez's funeral and publicly pledged allegiance to Bashar as the new president. Haydar then retired to his hometown of Hallet Ara and became deeply religious in his last years.  Death Ali Haydar died in Latakia, Syria, on 5 August 2022.   == References ==

In film studies, historical poetics is a scholarly approach to studying film, which David Bordwell outlined in his book Making Meaning (1989). Poetics studies the text itself rather than its production, reception or cultural significance and it can therefore be seen as a logical first step - though expressly not the last step - in terms of understanding how a narrative text (i.e. a television series or a film) works.  Overview Bordwell argues that theory-driven, interpretative approaches should be eschewed and argued that historical poetics was a better approach to studying film. Bordwell argues that "[a]ny inquiry into the fundamental principles by which a work in any representational medium is constructed can fall within the domain of poetics." Henry Jenkins makes a distinction between descriptive poetics and prescriptive poetics where the former examine "how artworks have been constructed" and the latter make a case for "how artworks should be constructed." Much of Bordwell's own research falls within the former category while an example of the latter is the Dogme 95 Manifesto by Danish directors Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg. Bordwell's research into the stylistic changes in Hollywood cinema demonstrates four specific changes: the use of more rapid editing, an increasingly frequent use of very long or very short lenses, a more prevalent use of close shots, and more camera movement. Historical poetics and neoformalism are part of the "post-theory" trend in film studies. Bordwell has repeatedly argued that some approaches — ones based in "Grand Theories" — do not study films per se but instead use films to confirm predetermined theoretical frameworks. He and Noël Carroll coined the term "S.L.A.B. theory" which refers to theorists Saussure, Lacan, Althusser, and Barthes. Historical poetics is considered to be related to cognitive film theory.

This Is Our Youth is a play by American dramatist and screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan. It premiered Off-Broadway in 1996 and since been produced all over the world, including the West End, Broadway, Sydney and Toronto.  Plot The play takes place in Dennis Ziegler's family's apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in March 1982.  Dennis's friend Warren Straub, a dejected 19-year-old, has just been kicked out of his house and stolen $15,000 from his abusive lingerie tycoon father.  Dennis, the more wily and domineering of the two, spends some of the money on cocaine, hoping to sell it to a friend for much more. Jessica Goldman, an "anxiously insightful" fashion student, arrives, and Warren hopes that he can use the money to entice her into bed. The play explores timeless issues of adolescence and maturity, as well as the Reagan Era in which it is set: the characters feel adrift in 1980s-style materialism.  Production history This Is Our Youth premiered as a one-act titled Betrayal by Everyone in 1993 at the Met in a festival of short plays. Originally produced by The New Group, the play opened Off-Broadway at the Intar Theatre on October 26, 1996 and closed on November 24, 1996 after 22 performances. Directed by Mark Brokaw, the cast featured Josh Hamilton as Dennis, Mark Ruffalo as Warren, and Missy Yager as Jessica. It again played Off-Broadway in a Second Stage revival at the McGinn/Cazale Theatre, from November 3, 1998 to May 2, 1999, with the original cast, except for Mark Rosenthal as Dennis. It transferred to the Douglas Fairbanks Theatre. The US West Coast premier took place in October, 2000 at the B Street Theater in Sacramento, California, produced by co-founding brothers Buck and Timothy Busfield. The play starred Peter Humer, Andrew Benator and Jessica Goldman and was directed by Amy Resnick.  In the West End, it played at the Garrick Theatre from 2 March 2002 to 15 March 2003. The opening cast was Jake Gyllenhaal, Hayden Christensen, and Anna Paquin. Notable replacements included Matt Damon, Colin Hanks, Chris Klein, Freddie Prinze Jr., Alison Lohman, Heather Burns, Casey Affleck and Kieran Culkin. The production was produced by Phil Cameron for Background, Clare Lawrence and Anna Waterhouse for Out of the Blue (for and on behalf of Back to Blue Limited). A non-equity production directed by Serge Seiden was presented by Studio Theatre 2ndStage in Washington, DC from May 16 to June 30, 2002. The cast included Karl Miller, Jon Bernthal, and Amy Montminy. The Australian premiere was produced by Black Swan Theatre Company and Echelon Productions at The Store Room, Melbourne in 2002. It starred Ditch Davey, Tim Wright and Amanda Levy. In 2003, Woody Harrelson directed a production of This Is Our Youth for the Berkeley Street Theatre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with Fabrizio Filippo, Marya Delver and Marcello Cabezas in the cast. The play premiered on Broadway at the Cort Theatre in previews beginning August 18, 2014 and opening September 11, 2014 for a 20-week run (through January 4, 2015). Directed by Anna D. Shapiro and produced by Steppenwolf, the cast starred Michael Cera, Kieran Culkin, and Tavi Gevinson. Prior to Broadway, this production ran at Steppenwolf Theatre Company, Chicago, with the same director and cast, from June 10 to July 27, 2014. Also prior to Broadway, Cera and Culkin, who co-starred in 2010's Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, had been in talks to stage a revival in New York during 2010; they later headlined a run at the Sydney Opera House in March 2012 helmed by original director Brokaw.  Casts Note: Below are the principal casts of major productions.  Reception Writing in The New York Times, critic Peter Marks called the play (in 1996) "a revealing and offbeat dissection of its world," adding, "It is not easy to find love and humor in the middle of nowhere. But with the skill of a first-rate creative team, even nowhere can be someplace special." Reviewing the 1998 production two years later, Marks wrote, "'This Is Our Youth' is back, and not a moment too soon. In a season in which some of the wise men of the theater have been trying to force-feed insipid fare like 'Stupid Kids' and 'Footloose' to young audiences, it's sheer relief to celebrate the return of a rambunctious and witty play about wayward teen-agers and post-adolescents that doesn't turn youthful travails into plastic rap." Marks cited the play's "indelible impression," the playwright's "unfailing antennae," writing, "'This Is Our Youth'-- by turns caustic, cruel and compassionate -- is the real real world." This Is Our Youth ranked 21st in Andy Propst's list of the greatest plays ever written and 12th in the 2018 New York Times critics' list of the best American plays of the past 25 years.

Emperor Giản Định (Vietnamese: Giản Định Đế, chữ Hán: 簡定帝, 1375–1410), real name Trần Ngỗi (陳頠), was the leader of the Vietnamese Trần royalist forces who rebelled against the Ming Chinese rule. Giản Định was the second son of Trần Nghệ Tông, was given the title Giản Định vương (簡定王, "Prince Giản Định"). Ming China conquered Vietnam in 1407, he fled to Mô Độ (modern Yên Mô District, Ninh Bình Province) and revolted against China in September 1408. At first he was defeated by Chinese army, later, he was supported by two Vietnamese generals, Đặng Tất and Nguyễn Cảnh Chân, and occupied Nghệ An Province successfully. Giản Định decided to attack Đông Đô (modern Hanoi) but was opposed by Đặng Tất and Nguyễn Cảnh Chân. Giản Định soon had both Đặng Tất and Nguyễn Cảnh Chân arrested and killed, causing dissent and revolt in his army. Đặng Dung and Nguyễn Cảnh Dị, sons of Đặng Tất and Nguyễn Cảnh Chân respectively, installed Trần Quý Khoáng (Trùng Quang Đế) as the new emperor in Chi La (modern Đức Thọ District, Hà Tĩnh Province). Giản Định was arrested by Trùng Quang in 1409, and was granted the title thái thượng hoàng ("Retired Emperor"). He was sent to Hạ Hồng (modern Ninh Giang District, Hải Dương Province) to attack Chinese army, but was defeated by Zhang Fu and fled to Diễn Châu. Consequently, the Chinese took him captive and transferred him to Nanjing, where he was beheaded around 1410.  References Trần Trọng Kim (2005). Việt Nam sử lược (in Vietnamese).

The BC Lions are a professional Canadian football team based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and are members of the West Division in the Canadian Football League (CFL). The franchise was founded as an expansion team of the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU) in 1954. In their 56-year history, the team has appeared in nine Grey Cup finals, and has won five championships. The Lions' current head coach is Rick Campbell and the current owner is Amar Doman. The Lions' first head coach was Canadian Football Hall of Famer Annis Stukus, who coached the team for two WIFU seasons. The Annis Stukus Trophy—awarded annually to the CFL's best head coach—is named after Stukus. In 1958, the team joined the CFL as one of their charter members. Clem Crowe coached the Lions for its last two seasons in the WIFU and was their first head coach in the CFL. After coaching the first three games of the 1958 season, Crowe was replaced by a group of seven people who coached the Lions for the next two games. Dan Edwards was named head coach for the remaining 11 games. Dave Skrien was the first head coach to coach the Lions for more than three seasons. In his seven years coaching the team he led the Lions to two consecutive Grey Cup finals, including the team's first championship in 1964. Vic Rapp coached the Lions from 1977 until the end of the 1982 season. He coached 96 regular season games with the Lions, which ranks second among Lions head coaches. Rapp won the Annis Stukus Trophy in the 1977 season, the only Lions head coach to do so without winning a Grey Cup championship. Hall of Famer Don Matthews took over the coaching position in the 1983 season and coached the Lions until midway through the 1987 season. He led the Lions to a Grey Cup championship and was named the Annis Stukus Trophy winner in the 1985 season. Matthews' .706 regular season winning percentage is the best among Lions head coaches. From 1988 until 2002, no Lions head coach term lasted as long as four complete seasons. During this time, the Lions won the Grey Cup championship twice: under head coach Dave Ritchie in 1994  and under Steve Buratto in 2000. Adam Rita is the only head coach to have had multiple tenures with the Lions. As of the end of the 2011 season, Wally Buono is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached, regular-season games won, regular-season points, playoff games coached, and playoff games won. Buono coached the Lions to their fifth and sixth Grey Cup championships and was awarded the Annis Stukus Trophy in the 2006 and 2011 seasons. He is the only Lions head coach to have won more than one Grey Cup. Excluding the group of seven, and counting Rita once, there have been 26 head coaches for the Lions franchise.  Key Head coaches Note: Statistics are current through the end of the 2023 CFL season.  Notes a  A running total of the number of coaches of the Lions. Thus, any coach who has two or more separate terms as head coach is only counted once. b  Each year is linked to an article about that particular CFL season. c  The Lions were coached by a group of players led by Chuck Quilter,  Byron Bailey, and Paul Cameron, assistant coaches Vic Lindskog and Walt Schlinkman, training camp coach Fred Owens, and general manager Herb Capozzi during a two-game period in the 1958 CFL season.

The southern even-fingered gecko (Alsophylax laevis) is a ground and tree dwelling species of gecko found in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Tajikistan and Afghanistan.  This species of gecko lives in the desert and shrublands. The Gecko is part of a divergence from the Squamata order around 65 million years ago, and the species is part of the family Gekkonidae. Limited research has been done on the southern even-fingered gecko due to the fact that the species is critically endangered. The Gecko has only been captured once in recent years. In 2020 it was captured for the first time since 1963. Conservation efforts are being put in place to mitigate the harm caused to the habitat of the gecko.  Distribution and habitat The Southern Even-fingered Gecko is a species of gecko that can be found in southern Turkmenistan, southern Uzbekistan, northern Iran, Tajikistan and northern Afghanistan. The gecko lives in a somewhat sporadic area across these countries in what can be known as a "broken zone district". This means that the populations of the gecko are not consistent across the regions. The general area in which they are found tends to be around 200-250 meters above sea level.  Behavior and ecology The behavior of the Southern Even-fingered Gecko is still mostly unknown as they have only been spotted a few times over the last few decades. The Ecology of the Gecko is more understood, as the sightings have been in a small region. In the countries Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, and Tajikistan the gecko lives in the Badghyz and Karabil semi-desert. The biome in these areas is classified as Deserts and Xeric Shrublands. In the countries Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan, the gecko has been spotted in the Central Asian southern desert which is again part of the Deserts and Xeric Shrublands biomes. In Iran and Turkmenistan the gecko is found in the Kopet Dag semi-desert as well as the Kopet Dag woodlands and forest steppe. These areas are classified in the deserts, xeric shrublands, Montane Grasslands, and shrublands biomes. All of these realms belong to the Palearctic realm.  Characteristics The Southern Even-fingered Gecko is a relatively small type of gecko weighing about 1 gram total for males and females. Their only form of transportation is through running. The symmetry of the gecko is bilateral meaning the gecko is symmetric running head to tail and having nearly identical right and left sides. The Gecko has an otolith auditory system which is an inner-ear system that can detect acceleration and possible acoustic signals. The visual system that the Geckos have is through corneal eyes similar to that of a human. They are a nocturnal species which reproduce through Oviparous reproduction. Meaning that the species lays eggs outside of the mother as a form of reproduction. The gecko lays eggs in litters of 1 about 1-2 times per year. The eggs are measured at a length of about 9 mm with a width of about 7mm. The gestation period of the eggs is around 56 days. The snout to vent length on the gecko is about 3 mm. The total length of the gecko is around 2.5 inches or 64 mm.  Diet The diet of the Southern even-fingered gecko is largely unknown, but most desert geckos tend to eat the same things. Since they are a nocturnal animal, they tend to hunt nocturnal insects as well, but will hunt any insect available. This would include insects such as ants, beetles, termites, moths, and crickets. They will also eat centipedes, millipedes, spiders, and worms. In times where food is scarce, they will use energy from fat stored in their tails.  Conservation The Southern Even-fingered Gecko is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN red list. Over the last 20-30 years the Southern even-fingered gecko has lost substantial habitat due to agriculture, overgrazing, and habitat destruction. Due to the declining loss of habitat there are some conservation efforts being put into place to help the livelihoods of the gecko, but as of now none of these efforts have been implemented. In the Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan region, research is being done to establish the gecko's distribution to identify strict protection areas. In these areas water sources are set to be improved to help the gecko as well as other types of wildlife. The final conservation idea would be to mitigate livestock interference by separating water sites in the valleys. This would reduce grazing and trampling of large animals on the habitat of the gecko. As of late 2023 though they are not in any protected areas, so a special reserve could be beneficial to help restore the population of the gecko.   == References ==

MaXware AS , was a provider of identity management, virtual directory and federation solutions. The company was located in Norway, the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States. Maxware AS was sold to SAP AG in May 2007. MaXware was best known for its  two flagship products the Directory Synchronisation Engine (DSE) and Virtual Directory Server (MVD), which is designed specifically for deployment in high-volume, high-complexity environments. MaXware’s MVD acts as an abstraction layer, extracting identity and context information out of various application and data silos. By re-mapping the underlying sources and presenting the identity data in customized views for the needs of enterprise applications, MVD enabled authentication and fine-grained authorization for identity management and context-driven applications. MaXware’s global customer base included companies in the fields of banking, finance, insurance, government, communications, manufacturing, education, entertainment and healthcare. Headquartered in Trondheim, Norway, MaXware had satellite offices in Freehold, NJ and Ipswich, UK, and distribution channels throughout the world.  History The history of the MaXware product range started at Norsk Data (ND). When ND discontinued NOTIS office software development in 1989. Former ND employees founded the company NOTIS AS. Simultaneously, Televerket (now Telenor) spun off its email and directories client work in another Norwegian startup, MaXware AS. In 1996, the two companies merged, and continued under the name Maxware to enforce the successful brand name. The product that is currently known as SAP NetWeaver Identity Management had its origins in 1995, as a project for Swedish Post, who needed a user management tool for its x.500 Directory service. The X.500 standard did not concern itself in how users were added or deleted from the directory. The management tool was called 'Add-On Service' (as in add on for a directory service), but soon changed the name to MDDM (MaXware Directory Data Manager). Later it was again renamed to DSE (Data Synchronisation Engine). The Virtual Directory Server (MVD) had a similar evolution. Some people from the MaXware development team from 1995 are still working with the product at SAP Labs in Trondheim. MaXware AS an Independent software vendor company, started in 1998, as a joint venture between EDB Business Partner and founder Tore Wold under the name MaXware International AS (MIAS). MIAS acquired all messaging products and the development team from EDB MaXware AS in 2001. In 2002, the MIAS management team together with its employees completed a Management buyout of the remaining shares from EDB MaXware AS. MIAS changed its name to MaXware AS in 2004. MaXware AS soon became a globally recognised innovator in developing identity management solutions. During this period the company established its subsidiaries in US, United Kingdom and Australia. Series A round funding was received from Viking venture and Four Seasons Venture. The VC companies were tasked to develop a successful exit strategy, when the Idm Market started to consolidate. MaXware AS was acquired by SAP AG in 2007. The products live on as SAP NetWeaver Identity Management and continue to be used by some of the largest corporations and governmental agencies in the world. In 2014, SAP AG merged the Trondheim office with SAP Labs in Sofia, Bulgaria, and closed the Norway office, marking the end of 20+ years of Identity Management development in Norway.

The Arma people are an ethnic group of the middle Niger River valley, descended from Moroccan invaders of the 16th century . The name, applied by other groups, derives from the word ar-rumah (Arabic: الرماة) "fusiliers". The Arma ethnicity is distinct from (but sometimes confused with) the 3.6 million Zarma people of western Niger, who predate the Moroccan invasion and speak the Zarma language, also a member of the Songhay languages. As of 1986, there were some 20,000 self-identified Arma in Mali, mostly around Timbuktu, the middle Niger bend and the Inner Niger Delta.  Songhai expedition and aftermath The 1590 expedition sent to conquer the Songhai Empire trade routes by the Saadi dynasty of Morocco was made up of four thousand Moroccan, Morisco refugees and European renegades . They were armed with European-style arquebuses. After the destruction of the Songhai Empire in 1591, the Moroccans settled into Djenné, Gao, Timbuktu and the larger towns of the Niger River bend . Never able to exert control outside their large fortifications, within a decade the expedition's leaders were abandoned by Morocco . In cities like Timbuktu, the men of the 1591 expedition intermarried with the Songhai, became small scale independent rulers, and some of their descendants came to be identified as minor dynasties of their own right .  By the end of the 17th century, Bambara, Tuareg, Fula and other forces came to control empires and city-states in the region, leaving the Arma as a mere ethnicity.

Rosemary Beach is an unincorporated planned community in Walton County, Florida, United States on a beach side road, CR 30A, on the Gulf Coast. Rosemary Beach is developed on land originally part of the older Inlet Beach neighborhood. The town was founded in 1995 by Patrick D. Bienvenue, President of Leucadia Financial Corporation, and was designed by Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company. The town is approximately 105 acres (0.42 km2) and, upon completion, included more than 400 home sites and a mixed-use town center with shops, restaurants, and activities. The design of the town reflects the French Quarter in New Orleans. Rosemary Beach was named after Rosemary Milligan, a realtor and entrepreneur, who inhabited the area since 1974 and owned much of the land that is now Rosemary Beach before selling the property to developers. The town is also rumored to be named after the fresh rosemary growing in the area.  Design Rosemary Beach is one of three planned communities on Florida's Gulf coast designed by Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk. The other two are Seaside and Alys Beach. The three are examples of a style of urban planning known as New Urbanism. Rosemary Beach, designed in 1995, offers shops, restaurants, a hotel, and public green spaces. The design of the town reflects New Orleans’ French Quarter and European Colonial influences in the West Indies and Caribbean. Sustainable materials, natural color palettes, high ceilings for better air circulation, balconies, and easy access to the beach by foot are typical design features. The architecture of the homes in Rosemary resemble places like New Orleans, St. Augustine, Charleston S.C., and the West Indies. The houses along Rosemary Beach are close together and are all neutral colored. The community has four open door swimming pools.  Beach Rosemary Beach beaches are only accessible to people who are staying in Rosemary at the time. To gain beach access, residents are required to have a code or a wristband to allow them to go to the beach. The water at this beach is warm, so many people can be found in the waves in the ocean along with walking or jogging down the beach, building sand castles, and reading. Vacationers can also rent different water activities, like kayaking or paddle boarding. Many residents rent out their houses for the summer.  Tourism There are nature reserves located around the Rosemary area, like Eden Gardens State Park, Timpoochee Trail and Deer State Park, and Topsail Hill Preserve State Park. There are hiking trails and different wildlife located in these areas. Camping is also available at Topsail Hill Preserve State Park. Tourism in Rosemary Beach has significantly spiked in the past few years. As tourists, the main form of transportation around the beach area is through biking. The temperature in Rosemary Beach during the summer ranges from a high of 90 °F (32 °C) to a low of 75 °F (24 °C). During the winter months, the temperature ranges from a high of 66 °F (19 °C) to a low of 45 °F (7 °C). Water activities are popular, such as, kayaking, paddle boarding, jet skiing, parasailing, and many more excursions. Along with the water activities, there are Blue Dolphin Tours, where one can sightsee for dolphins on a two-hour boat ride excursion. There is also a sunset tour option. There are many places for shopping around the 30A area. There are many boutiques which offer swimwear, beachwear, toys, home décor, souvenirs, etc.  See also Seaside, Florida Alys Beach, Florida New Urbanism  References External links Rosemary Beach

Dave's Picks Volume 49 is a four-CD live album by the rock band the Grateful Dead.  It contains two complete concerts recorded on April 27 and 28, 1985, at Frost Amphitheater in Stanford, California.  It was released on January 26, 2024, in a limited edition of 25,000 copies. Dave's Picks Volume 49 debuted at number 25 on the Billboard 200 album sales chart. With this album, the Grateful Dead broke the record for the most top 40 albums, with 59. The previous record of 58 top 40 albums was held by both Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley.  Critical reception On AllMusic, Timothy Monger said, "Volume 49 takes listeners back to 1985, when the Dead were celebrating their first two decades with a "20 Years So Far" tour.... Bay Area shows were always special, but Palo Alto was the band's backyard, and they cruise into these dates with easy confidence and a spirit of invention."

The MIT Aeronautics and Astronautics Department's Daedalus is a class of three human-powered aircraft that included Daedalus 88 – which, on 23 April 1988, flew a distance of 115.11 kilometres (71.53 mi) in 3 hours, 54 minutes, from Heraklion on the island of Crete to the island of Santorini. The flight holds official FAI world records for total distance, straight-line distance, and duration for human-powered aircraft. The class was named after the mythological inventor of aviation, Daedalus, and was inspired by the Greek myth of Daedalus' escape from Crete using manmade wings. The three aircraft in the class are:   Light Eagle (originally Michelob Light Eagle): a 42 kilograms (93 lb) prototype. Daedalus 87: Crashed during testing at Rogers Dry Lake (NASA Dryden Flight Research Center) on 17 February 1988, and was rebuilt as a backup. Daedalus 88: Flew from Crete to just off the beach on Santorini. Both Daedalus 87 and Daedalus 88 weighed 31 kilograms (68 lb). All three aircraft were constructed at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory Flight Facility at Hanscom Field outside Boston, Massachusetts, by a team of undergraduate students, faculty, and recent graduates of MIT.  History The MIT Daedalus project was the follow-on to several earlier human-powered aircraft flown at MIT, and was designed by veterans of the Chrysalis, Monarch A and Monarch B HPA projects. The team members composing the Daedalus project went on to make notable contributions to experimental aeronautics such as founding the Aurora Flight Sciences company.  Aircraft Light Eagle Light Eagle (known to the flight crew as MLE, or Emily) set a closed-course distance record with Glen Tremml as the pilot, as well as straight-line, closed-course, and duration women's records with Lois McCallin as pilot.  These record flights took place at Edwards AFB (NASA Dryden Flight Research Center) in January, 1987.  Light Eagle had been in storage in Manassas, VA, but in 2009 was restored and adapted for use as an unmanned solar-powered aircraft testbed by Aurora Flight Sciences.  Daedalus 87 Daedalus 87 was the first of the two Daedalus airplanes constructed, and was flight tested extensively at NASA Dryden Flight Research Center in California.  During flight testing, Daedalus 87 was damaged in a crash caused by spiral divergence, with the rudder not able to supply enough control authority to recover from a disturbance-initiated right turn.  The aircraft suffered damage to the right wing, fuselage, and propeller.  Daedalus 87 was repaired and returned to service to act as a backup airplane to Daedalus 88. Daedalus 87 was on display in the lobby at the Museum of Science, Boston until 2009, and is now on display above the tram stop for Terminal B at Dulles Airport outside Washington, DC.  Daedalus 88 The final aircraft in the MIT Daedalus series, Daedalus 88, was used in the flight from Crete.   Pieces of Daedalus 88 are now in storage at the Smithsonian's restoration facility. Both Daedalus aircraft were constructed with a framework of carbon fiber tubes.  Airfoil shape for the wing and tail elements was maintained with a thin polystyrene foam leading edge, polystyrene ribs, and a Kevlar trailing edge.  Wing skin was Mylar plastic of approximately 0.3 mil (8 μm) thickness.  The bottom portion of the fuselage and majority of the pilot seat were made of Kevlar as well.  Horizontal and vertical stabilizers were "all-moving" control surfaces.  Airfoils Mark Drela had recently written the program XFOIL, which enables the design of aerofoils and accurately predicts performance at a wide range of Reynolds numbers.  The wing sections never existed on paper, either as lists of numbers or as drawings. The information came out of the design program onto disc, and this guided the cutter. The spar of the MLE (Michelob Light Eagle) was three tubes aligned vertically. This scheme was abandoned for the final Daedalus design where the more usual single tube was used. Construction of Light Eagle took 15,000 hours work by 18 members of MIT. The airfoils which were used are: DAE11, DAE21, DAE31, and DAE51.  Record-setting flight The record-setting flight of Daedalus 88 had as pilot Olympic cyclist Kanellos Kanellopoulos of Greece.  The flight began at the main airport of Iraklion, on Crete, with a horizontal launch under the pilot's own power, as governed by FAI rules.  During the flight, the Daedalus flew primarily between 15 and 30 feet in altitude, and was accompanied by several escort vessels.  The speed of the flight was helped by a tailwind, but this also made a head-on landing approach to the narrow beach hazardous, especially with crowds of spectators on the sand.  The pilot maneuvered the aircraft to land more into the wind and parallel with the length of the beach.  As the right wing extended over the black sand beach, the heat rising from the beach lifted that wing, turning the aircraft back towards the sea.  This effect prevented the pilot from getting the whole aircraft onto the beach. The flight ended in the water (7 meters from Perissa Beach on Santorini, according to the official record), when increasing gusty winds caused a torsional failure of the tail boom.  Lacking control, the airplane then pitched nose-up, and another gust caused a failure of the main wing spar.  The pilot swam to shore. The pilot used a hydration drink during flight.

A by-election was held in Wallis and Futuna's 1st constituency on 15 April 2018. The by-election was called after the Constitutional Council invalidated the election of Napole Polutele, miscellaneous left candidate in the June 2017 legislative elections and member of the UDI, Agir and Independents group in the National Assembly, on 2 February 2018. Sylvain Brial defeated outgoing deputy Polutele in the first round of the by-election on 15 April.  Background In the 2017 legislative elections, miscellaneous right candidate Napole Polutele was elected in the first round with 50.24% of the vote against another miscellaneous right candidate, Sylvain Brial, who obtained 46.19% of votes, and Hervé Michel of The Republicans (LR), who secured 3.57% of the vote. Polutele, one of four deputies elected in the first round of the legislative elections, sponsored the candidacy of Emmanuel Macron in the presidential election and announced that he would sit with the presidential majority in the National Assembly; he ultimately joined the Constructives group as a related member, having sat as a member of the Socialist group in the previous legislature. After the election, Sylvain Brial decided to appeal the result to the Constitutional Council, claiming to have discovered irregularities in electoral lists and proxy votes. On 2 February 2018, the constitutional council ruled to void the election of Polutele. Under article L. 64 of the electoral code, should a voter be unable to sign the electoral roll at a polling station, the signature affixed, as required the third paragraph of article L. 62-1, should read "l'électeur ne peut signer lui-même" ("the voter cannot sign themselves") and be provided by a voter of their choice. However, 36 voters merely inscribed a "single cross" that could not be considered a signature, in addition to one voter unable to sign themselves whose vote was accompanied by the signature of another voter. Furthermore, 21 proxy votes were discarded under article R. 75 of the electoral code, either because no signature was given, or because a cross was provided rather than a signature. Because 57 votes were deducted and Polutele avoided a second round by only 16 votes, the constitutional council invalidated the election, triggering a by-election within three months. On 2 March 2018, the first round of the by-election was scheduled for 15 April 2018, with a second round on 22 April if no candidate secured a majority of votes in the first round. After his defeat, Polutele filed an appeal with the constitutional council on 26 April.  2017 election result 2018 by-election result References External links Results of past legislative by-elections from the Ministry of the Interior (in French)

The London Rock and Roll Show is a 1973 British-produced concert film directed by Peter Clifton chronicling a Rock and Roll Revival concert held at Wembley Stadium in London, England in August 1972.  Background From the late 1960s to the early 1970s, many rock and roll performers from the 1950s experienced major career revivals due to a temporary upswing of interest in their form of music. The Revival was marked by a series of major concerts in the United States, and also spread to Europe where events such as the Wembley concert attracted thousands of fans who came out to see the performers behind the music. London Rock and Roll Show begins with excerpts from numerous "warm-up" performers shown singing either covers of 1950s hits, or original tunes, including a performance by Screaming Lord Sutch that threatens to end the concert prematurely when he brings a stripper on stage. The main concert segment begins with Bo Diddley and continues with a string of other major performers including Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and Bill Haley and His Comets. The concert ends with an extended performance by Chuck Berry, who at the time was enjoying major chart success in Britain and the US with his "My Ding-a-Ling" (although he does not perform that song in this film). Mick Jagger also appears in several non-musical interludes in which he is interviewed about the performers. In 1975, the film was released in the U.S. by Richard Ellman Film Enterprises in Association with Aion Films in quadraphonic sound. Although no soundtrack release occurred at the time the film was made, one was finally issued in the early 2000s, followed by several different DVD releases with different combinations of performances.  Songs performed The House Shakers   "Be Bop A Lula" Heinz  "C'mon Everybody" Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages  "Great Big Coffin" "Looking for Mary" Bo Diddley  "Road Runner" "Bring It to Jerome" "Mona" A recording of "Peggy Sue" by Buddy Holly was played. Jerry Lee Lewis  "High School Confidential" "You Can Have Her" "Chantilly Lace" "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" "Medley: Hound Dog / Good Golly Miss Molly / Blue Suede Shoes / Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" "Sweet Little Sixteen" Bill Haley & His Comets  "Shake, Rattle and Roll" "See You Later Alligator" "Rock Around the Clock" (plus encore) Some DVD releases omit "Shake, Rattle and Roll". Little Richard  "Lucille" "Rip It Up" "Good Golly Miss Molly" "Tutti Frutti" "Jenny, Jenny" Chuck Berry  "School Days" "Memphis Tennessee" "Sweet Little Sixteen" "Let It Rock" "Mean Ole Frisco'" "Wee Wee Hours" "Medley: Oh Carol!/ Little Queenie" "Reelin' and Rockin'" Several different DVD releases exist of this film, not all of which include the complete songlist, above. Additional performances were also recorded, but not included in the film.

The 2020 Oregon wildfire season was the most destructive on record in the state of Oregon. The season is a part of the 2020 Western United States wildfire season. The fires killed at least 11 people, burned more than 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of land, and destroyed thousands of homes.  Timeline The Oregon Department of Forestry declared fire season beginning on July 5, 2020, signaling the end of unregulated debris burning outdoors.  In early September, unusually high winds and continued dry weather caused the rapid expansion of multiple wildfires in Oregon. Over 1,000,000 acres were burned, and about 40,000 people were evacuated, with about 500,000 people in evacuation warning areas. The cities of Phoenix, Talent, Detroit, and Gates in Oregon were substantially destroyed by the Almeda Drive and Santiam Fires respectively. State-wide, at least 7 people have been killed. In the Almeda Fire area — between Ashland, Talent, and Phoenix — more than 2,800 structures were destroyed. Around the South Obenchain Fire, which stretched from Shady Cove nearly to Butte Falls, 153 structures were lost. Sheriff Sickler said that these numbers do not differentiate between homes, businesses, outbuildings, and other structures. Assessing the precise nature of those structures lost will fall to local teams in the days and weeks ahead. Officials stated that the Almeda Drive Fire was human-caused. On September 11, a man was arrested for arson, for allegedly starting a fire that destroyed multiple homes in Phoenix and merged with the Almeda Drive Fire. A separate criminal investigation into the origin point of the Almeda Drive Fire in Ashland is ongoing.  Causes Through the end of July 2020, 90% of Oregon's wildfires had been caused by humans versus a yearly average of 70%, possibly because of increased outdoor recreation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rumors and theories Rumors spread on social media that antifa activists were deliberately setting fires and preparing to loot property that was being evacuated. Some residents refused to evacuate based on the rumors, choosing to defend their homes from the alleged invasion. Authorities pleaded with residents to ignore the rumors. One Facebook post shared thousands of times falsely stated, "KXL Radio in Portland reported today that Firefighters are now being shot at by suspected Antifa and BLM members." QAnon followers participated in the misinformation, with one false claim that six antifa activists had been arrested for setting fires amplified by Q specifically. There were also rumors that members of far-right groups had started some of the fires, though authorities labeled the claims as false, saying that people needed to question claims that they found on social media. Senator Jeff Merkley, (D-OR) decried President Donald Trump's comments blaming forest management for the fires as a "devastating lie.” Speaking on This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Merkley blamed climate change for the fires. One of the major fires, the Almeda fire in Southern Oregon, was worsened by a second blaze that was allegedly the result of arson. The first origin point of the fire is still under active investigation, and arson is suspected there, as well. Several small brush fires in Portland that were quickly put out were also the result of arson by a suspect who was apprehended, released, and then started several more.

Michael Richard Jeffrey (born 11 August 1971) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker. In a career lasted from 1989 to 2002, Jeffrey notably played in the top flight of English, Dutch and Scottish football with spells in the Premier League with Newcastle United, in the Eredivisie for Fortuna Sittard and in the Scottish Premier League for Kilmarnock. He has also played professionally in the Football League for Bolton Wanderers, Doncaster Rovers, Rotherham United, Grimsby Town and Scunthorpe United.  Career Jeffrey began his career with Bolton Wanderers in 1988, although it was a move to Doncaster Rovers in 1992 that kickstarted his career as he scored 19 goals in 42 League appearances. He joined Premier League side Newcastle United in October 1993, but under Kevin Keegan he would only make a total of five appearances in all competitions, with a solitary goal coming in a 1–1 League Cup draw against Manchester City on 30 November 1994. In June 1995 he signed for Rotherham United for £100,000, scoring five goals from twenty appearances before he was subject to a bid from newly-promoted Eredivise side Fortuna Sittard in December. He joined Fortuna for £225,000 only six months into his time at Rotherham. He scored 25 goals in 123 appearances over the next few seasons as Fortuna fended off relegation from the Dutch top flight. In May 1999 he signed for Scottish Premier League side Kilmarnock but saw minimal action which lead him to sign for Grimsby Town the following summer. His time at Grimsby only yielded two league goals over several seasons and during the 2001–02 season he was loaned out to Scunthorpe United. Following his release by Grimsby in the summer of 2002, Jeffrey retired aged only 30 years old.  Personal life Since retiring from football in 2002, Jeffrey has resided in his native Liverpool and has worked as a car salesman.  References External links Michael Jeffrey at Soccerbase

A popcorn ceiling, also known as a stipple ceiling or acoustic ceiling, is a ceiling with one of a variety of spray-on or paint-on treatments. The bumpy surface is created by tiny particles of vermiculite or polystyrene, which gives the ceiling sound-deadening properties. Mixtures are available in fine, medium, and coarse grades. In many parts of the world, it was the standard for bedroom and residential hallway ceilings for its bright, white appearance, ability to hide imperfections, and acoustic characteristics. In comparison, kitchen and living room ceilings would normally be finished in smoother skip-trowel or orange peel texture for their higher durability and ease of cleaning. Popcorn ceilings, in pre-1970s and early formulations, often contained white asbestos fibers.  When asbestos was banned in ceiling treatments by the Clean Air Act in the United States, popcorn ceilings fell out of favor in much of the country.  However, in order to minimize economic hardship to suppliers and installers, existing inventories of asbestos-bearing texturing materials were exempt from the ban, so it is possible to find asbestos in popcorn ceilings that were applied through the 1980s.  After the ban, popcorn ceiling materials were created using a paper-based or Styrofoam product to create the texture, rather than asbestos.  Textured ceilings remain common in residential construction in the United States. Since the mid-2000s, the popularity of textured popcorn ceilings has diminished significantly across North America. A trend toward more modern, clean-lined design features has influenced home improvement professionals to provide popcorn ceiling removal services. In comparison to smooth ceilings, textured ceilings are generally less reflective of natural light, may harbor more dust and allergens, and may be more difficult to patch and touch up after drywall repair.

The Pacific Basketball Circuit (Spanish: Circuito de Baloncesto del Pacífico or CIBAPAC) is a semi-professional basketball league based in Northwestern Mexico. It was founded in 2015 with the purpose of developing young talent from the region. The league began with four charter members from Sinaloa and Durango but has since grown to include teams from across the country. As of 2023, there were 31 teams from 10 states.  Format The CIBAPAC is a developmental league that was created with the aim of developing young talent in Northwestern Mexico, especially in cities without a professional team. Outside of the two foreign players allowed per roster, the teams are made up of local talent. League rules require teams to play an under-17 player for the entire first quarter and an under-21 player for the entire second quarter. The goal is for young players to get scouted and earn college scholarships or professional contracts.  History Foundation and early years (2015–2016) The Circuito de Baloncesto del Pacífico (CIBAPAC) was founded in July 2015. The competition, which was officially presented at a press conference the following month, was created as a developmental league for young talent in the Pacific region of Mexico, with the teams initially based in the states of Sinaloa and Durango in its first season. The charter members of the CIBAPAC were the following:  Empacadores de La Palma (Navolato, Sinaloa) Halcones de Guamúchil (Guamúchil, Sinaloa) Liebres de Guasave (Guasave, Sinaloa) Linces de Santiago Papasquiaro (Santiago Papasquiaro, Durango) Notably, the Halcones de Guamúchil signed an agreement with the Caballeros de Culiacán of the Circuito de Baloncesto de la Costa del Pacífico (CIBACOPA). The Linces de Santiago Papasquiaro became the inaugural CIBAPAC champions after beating the Empacadores de La Palma in the finals. The CIBAPAC held its second season in 2016 with five teams. Once again, each team was allowed to sign up to two import players. Notably, former Mexico national team member Jesús "Cachuy" González joined the Empacadores de La Palma at the start of the season while waiting to sign with a Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional (LNBP) team; he eventually agreed to a deal with the Santos de San Luis. The Paskolas de Navojoa won the 2016 CIBAPAC title in their debut season after sweeping the Empacadores de La Palma, 3–0, in the finals. The Paskolas directly qualified for the finals after the Ingenieros de Culiacán were unable to travel to Navojoa for the semifinals due to economic problems, which was condemned by league president César Ojeda. The Ingenieros were not allowed to return the following season after failing league requirements.  Expansion (2017–2019) Ahead of the 2017 season, the league doubled its number of teams from five to 10, with six from Sinaloa, two from Durango and two from Sonora. The teams were the following:  The CIBAPAC held its first All-Star Game on 19 November 2017 in Durango at the Auditorio del Pueblo, the home venue of the Águilas UNES. Zona Norte defeated Zona Sur by a score of 114–109 and Jeff Stubbs was named the All-Star Game MVP. Additionally, Corey Hall won the three-point contest while Jay Hedegeman won the dunk contest. The league championship was won by the Águilas UNES, who swept the Peregrinos de Badiraguato in the finals.  Ahead of its 2018 season, the CIBAPAC grew from 10 to 11 teams. While the league lost the Águilas UNES, the Guerreros de Choix, and the Vikingos de Los Mochis, it added the Águilas UAS, the Fortaleza 31, the Guaycuras de La Paz, and the Marlins de San José del Cabo. The second CIBAPAC All-Star Game was held on 28 October in La Paz at the Arena La Paz. Zona Norte defeated Zona Sur, 148–116. Following the success of the Peregrinos de Badiraguato the previous season, the municipal government invested MXN$100,000 so that the team could give the public free admission to all their home games in 2018. The Peregrinos went on to reach the finals, where they defeated the Linces de Santiago Papasquiaro, 3–2, to capture the league championship. Three teams left the CIBAPAC ahead of its 2019 season, including the former champions, the Águilas UNES. However, the league expanded to a total of 16 teams that year due to eight additions: the Capitanes de Puerto Peñasco, the Colorados de San Luis Río Colorado, the Delfines de Mazatlán, the Dragones de Comondú, the Ensenada Lobos, the Guinda de Nogales, the Hardcore de Loreto, and the Mineros de Santa Rosalía. League president César Ojeda announced that the 16 teams would be divided into two groups. The 2019 CIBAPAC All-Star Game was held on 28 September in Ensenada at the Óscar “Tigre” García Municipal Gymnasium, the home of the Ensenada Lobos. The Western Conference defeated the Eastern Conference, 116–103, while Lobos player Jeff Early Jr. was named the All-Star Game MVP. Early won the dunk contest at halftime while his Lobos teammate, Luis “Chupa” Ramírez, won the three-point contest. The Peregrinos de Badiraguato beat the Delfines de Mazatlán in the Eastern Conference finals while the Colorados de San Luis Río Colorado defeated the Ensenada Lobos in the Western Conference finals, setting up a matchup between the two for the title. In the finals, the Colorados overcame a 2–0 series deficit against the Peregrinos by winning three games in a row to secure the 2019 CIBAPAC championship.  Pandemic and recovery (2020–2022) The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic brought uncertainty to the CIBAPAC and its teams. Other leagues in the region, such as the CIBACOPA and the Liga de Básquetbol Estatal de Chihuahua, suspended their campaigns. The 2020 CIBAPAC season was originally planned to begin on 10 July, which was earlier than in past years. This was later pushed back to August and then October. However, by September, the league was stil unable to confirm a start date for the season, though league president César Ojeda assured that 24 teams were registered to play. In early October, the Peregrinos de Badiraguato announced that their team would not participate in the 2020 season due to public health concerns, becoming the third team to opt out after the Marlins de San José del Cabo and the Dragones de Comondú. A few days later, it was announced that a shortened 2020 season would be held from 12 to 16 November in the state of Baja California Sur using a "bubble" format, similar to the NBA Bubble used for the 2020 NBA playoffs. It was also originally announced that there would be eight teams divided into two groups that would play in Loreto and San José del Cabo. The 2020 "bubble" playoffs ultimately consisted of a six-team round-robin tournament, held in La Paz and Cabo San Lucas, where the top two teams then qualified for the championship game. The Guaycuras de La Paz defeated the Pelícanos de Cabo San Lucas, 96–93, in the finals to capture the 2020 CIBAPAC title. Additionally, the Delfines de Mazatlán beat the Choyeros de San José del Cabo, 77–73, in the third-place game. The 2021 CIBAPAC season was initially scheduled to begin in late August, but it was pushed back to late September to allow for more people to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. 37 teams from 11 different states were divided into six groups, or "Regions". There were a record seven teams in Baja California (Region 2) and six in Baja California Sur (Region 1). The league, which originated in the Pacific region in the Northwest of the country, had officially expanded to the opposite coast. Region 6 was composed of teams based in Tamaulipas and Veracruz, both of which border the Gulf of Mexico. Notably, the Ensenada Lobos signed Devonta Pollard, a former McDonald's All-American. Additionally, the Guerreros de Xalapa hired Jessica Elizondo to lead the team, and she became the first woman to serve as head coach of a professional basketball team in Mexico. Instead of staging one single All-Star Game, the league held one for each Region. In the first round of the playoffs, 14-year-old Oliver Vargas suited up for the Ganaderos de Durango. Each Region held a semifinals and finals round, each in a best-of-three format to determine their respective champions. The winners of each Region were the following:  The Regional winners then progressed to the quarterfinal round, which was played in a best-of-five format. The Ensenada Lobos beat the Pelícanos de Cabos San Lucas while the Demoledora de Linares beat the Guerreros de Xalapa, each winning their respective series' 3–1 to secure their semifinals spots. The Delfines de Mazatlán then pulled out of their series against the Potros de Casas Grandes, which was tied 2–2 at the time, knowing they would still qualify for the last semifinal spot as the "best losers" for winning two games. The "Final Four" was played in Ensenada on the first weekend of December, shifting to a single-elimination format. The Delfines de Mazatlán and the Potros de Casas Grandes met again in the first semifinal; Steve Pledger scored 30 points to lead the Potros to an 88–83 victory. The Ensenada Lobos beat the Demoledora de Linares, 96–93, in the other semifinal the next day, with Jeff Early Jr. recording 48 points, eight rebounds and five assists. The Lobos defeated the Potros, 103–88, in the championship game, and Early was named the Finals MVP after scoring 36 points. The 2022 CIBAPAC season tipped off in September, with 25 teams from nine states divided into six Regions. The Ensenada Lobos signed Kezo Brown while one of the expansion teams, the Buras de Hermosillo, signed Gaston Essengué. 16 teams qualified for the playoffs. The Leones de Guadalajara  defeated the Mineros de Cananea, 3–1, in the finals, winning the league title in their debut season.  Continued growth (2023–present) In January 2023, league president César Ojeda led a meeting in Guasave between owners of 24 teams – the first owners' meeting announcing that the team registration deadline was mid-February and the tentative start date to the new season was 9 June. The league became official affiliates of FIBA and the Asociación Deportiva Mexicana de Básquetbol (ADEMEBA). In an effort to move towards professionalism, it also established a rule ending the practice of using local referees for home games. In March, the Guaycuras de La Paz presented a women's section complete with a full roster and coaching staff, even though there was no CIBAPAC women's league. The league did announce, however, the creation of the Copa Gobernadora, a competition between the five teams based in Baja California (Ensenada, Mexicali, Rosarito, Tecate and Tijuana), organized in collaboration with the Baja California Institute of Sport and Physical Culture. Notably, the Reyes de Durango signed Irwin Ávalos, a hometown player and national team member. The 2023 season tipped off in June, with 31 teams from 10 states divided into six Regions. The CIBAPAC All-Star Game was played on 2 July in San Luis Río Colorado. A few days later, 14-year-old Ulises Ortiz made his debut for the Reyes de Durango.

Difluorodioxirane (CF2O2) is a rare, stable member of the dioxirane family, known for a single oxygen-oxygen bond (O-O). Unlike most dioxiranes that decompose quickly, difluorodioxirane is surprisingly stable at room temperature, making it potentially useful for further research and applications.  Synthesis Difluorodioxirane was first synthesised by Russo and DesMarteau in 1993 by treating fluorocarbonyl hypofluorite (FCOOF) with X2 (= F2, Cl2 or ClF) over pelletized CsF in a flow system.  It also likely exists as a possible intermediate in reactions involving other fluorine-containing compounds.  Properties Unlike most dioxiranes that decompose quickly, difluorodioxirane is surprisingly stable at room temperature due to the stabilising interacton of two fluorine atoms with the ring. This effect makes the O-O bond less reactive and more stable compared to other dioxiranes. The central F–C–F angle is 109°, approximately a tetrahedral angle. Difluorodioxirane is known for its ability to perform regiospecific and stereoselective oxidations. This makes it a valuable tool in organic synthesis for precise manipulation of molecules. Despite its increased stability, difluorodioxirane can still act as an oxidizing agent, transferring oxygen to other molecules. it often leads to cleaner and more predictable reaction outcomes due to its controlled reactivity.  Uses Difluorodioxirane itself has not yet found widespread applications due to its recent discovery. However, its unique stability and  reactivity similar to other dioxiranes suggest potential uses in several areas:  Organic synthesis: Due to its oxidizing properties, difluorodioxirane could be a valuable reagent in organic reactions, particularly for controlled oxidation processes. Researchers are exploring its potential applications in epoxidation (adding oxygen atoms to create epoxide rings), hydroxylation (adding hydroxyl groups -OH), and other oxidation reactions. Development of new catalysts: The stability and reactivity profile of difluorodioxirane make it a promising candidate for the development of new and more efficient catalysts for various organic transformations.

The PWG World Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling world tag team championship contested for in the tag team division of the Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) promotion. It was created and debuted on January 25, 2004, at PWG's Tango & Cash Invitational – Night Two event, where B-Boy and Homicide were crowned the inaugural champions. Being a professional wrestling championship, title reigns are not won legitimately; they are instead won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. The title has been referred to as the PWG Tag Team Championship and as the PWG World Tag Team Championship since 2004. There have been a total of 36 reigns among 38 wrestlers and 27 teams.  History On January 25, 2004, PWG debuted their version of a tag team championship, which they named the PWG Tag Team Championship. B-Boy and Homicide won a two night tournament named the Tango & Cash Invitational to become the first champions at Tango & Cash Invitational – Night Two. The championship was defended for the first time outside the United States on February 18, 2006, when then-champions, Davey Richards and Super Dragon, defeated Cape Fear (El Generico and Quicksilver) in Essen, Germany at PWG's European Vacation – Germany event. After this event and one held on February 19, 2006 in Orpington, England where the championship was defended once again, PWG renamed the championship to the PWG World Tag Team Championship. The championship later changed hands for the first time outside the United States on October 27, 2007, at PWG's European Vacation II – England event, where then-champions Kevin Steen and El Generico were defeated by Davey Richards and Super Dragon in Portsmouth, England. On July 27, 2014,[1] Candice LeRae became the first female wrestler to hold the title, when she and Joey Ryan defeated The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) to become the new champions. On June 16, 2017, Penta el Zero M and Rey Fenix successfully defended the title in Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl, Mexico.  Reigns The inaugural champions were B-Boy and Homicide, who won the championship by defeating the team of The American Dragon and Super Dragon in the finals of the Tango & Cash Invitational Tag Team Tournament on January 25, 2004, at PWG's Tango & Cash Invitational – Night Two event. At 801 days and counting, The Rascalz (Zachary Wentz and Dezmond Xavier) are the longest reigning tag team champions in their first reign. The Unbreakable F'n Machines' (Brian Cage and Michael Elgin) only reign, Monster Mafia's (Ethan Page and Josh Alexander) only reign and the Beaver Boys' (Alex Reynolds and John Silver) only reign share the record for the shortest in the title's history at less than one day.

King's Meaburn (English: ) is a small village and civil parish in Cumbria, England. It is located 5 miles (8.0 km) from Appleby-in-Westmorland and 10 miles (16 km) from Penrith, situated in the valley of the River Lyvennet. The river flows just to the west of the village and was crossed by a ford on the road to Newby and Morland. According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 105, which increased to 135 according to the 2011 Census. The village is renowned for hosting an annual Beer Festival at The White Horse.  History King's Meaburn was believed to be an Anglo-Saxon settlement during the 7th and 8th centuries, which is supported by the Anglo-Saxon origin of its name. The name "Meaburn" derives from "Meadburn," signifying a meadow by a stream. The name King's Meaburn goes back to the 12th century. The King at the time, Henry II, gave part of the village's lands to Sir Hugh de Morville, and the other part to his sister, Maud de Veteripont. Sir Hugh eventually fell out of favour with the King, after which the King reclaimed Sir Hugh's section of the land, and hence the name King's Meaburn. The land that belonged to Maud was and to this day (September 2008) is called Maulds Meaburn. One notable event in the village was in 1745 when Charles Edward Stuart aka Bonnie Prince Charlie and some of his soldiers crossed the ford in the village on their way to rendezvous with more of his troops in Shap.  Geography and Weather Due to the village's position relative to the nearby mountains, the village can be subject to strong winds known as the Helm Wind.  Churches Churches in King's Meaburn include St Mary's, the Wesleyan Chapel and the New Methodist Church.  Watermill Steele's Mill is now a holiday cottage. It retains a waterwheel, three grinding stones set into a floor, and the original apple-wood cogs and gearing encased in glass.  Public Services The village has an inn called the White Horse Inn which doubles up as a post office. King's Meaburn used to have a school until it closed down in 1983.

Croydon is an inner western suburb of Adelaide, South Australia. It is located in the City of Charles Sturt. The area is named after Croydon, located in London, England  History The land on which the suburb now stands was purchased in 1853 by Alfred Watts and Philip Levi. They laid out the Village of Croydon in 1855, comprising Croydon Farm of 40 acres (16 ha) and lots of up to 5 acres (2.0 ha). The village may have been named after Croydon, England, then a part of Surrey, Now a part of London, the same county in which Levi had been born. In 1904, market gardener and greengrocer John Brooker founded a jams and conserves business on Queen Street, producing "Croydon" branded products. The business prospered, leading to the construction of the Croydon Jam Factory on the corner of Queen Street and Princes Street in 1945. However production was soon moved to Woodville North in 1951. The Croydon factory became a warehouse for Godfreys Ltd., a whitegoods retailer. One of Croydon's first farm barns, later converted into a home in the 1920s still exists far into a lot on Bedford Street, Croydon. This good example of a Brick and Stone building provide's a direct link to Croydon's history.  This Original Barn, now renovated into a family home, is believed to have been built by Richard Day who developed the suburb over 100 years ago. Richard Day developed his own villa-style cottage on the site of 14 St Lawrence Ave in Croydon which could be reached via a long driveway from South Road. It was demolished circa 1970 at which point a retirement village was built in its place. At this time, Croydon was mainly farmland.  Geography Croydon is situated approximately 4.5 km (2.8 mi) north-west of Adelaide and 6.5 km (4.0 mi) directly east from the coast at Grange.

Lecythis ampla is a species of woody plant in the family Lecythidaceae, which also includes the Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa). Common names include coco, olla de mono, jicaro and salero.  It is found in Central and South America. It has been considered an endangered species in Costa Rica (IUCN, 1988).  Description Lecythis ampla is a large tree growing to 45 m (148 ft) in height with no branches on its lower part. It is deciduous with most of the leaves dropping before it blooms and new leaves appearing in flushes with the flowers. The bark is greyish brown and vertically furrowed. The glossy leaves are alternate and elliptical with wavy edges. The flowers appear between May and July and are pollinated by bees. They have six petals that are either pink or pale mauve, but fade to white as the flower ages. The fruit is a woody capsule up to 20 by 30 cm (7.9 by 11.8 in) that hangs from the branch. It resembles a little pot and when it is ripe, after about ten months, the lid comes off and the nuts fall to the forest floor.  Distribution Lecythis ampla is endemic to Central America, extending from Nicaragua to Ecuador  and Brazil.  It is common in wet forests on the Atlantic slope in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, and is found near the Pacific coast in Ecuador and in Colombia's Cauca and Magdalena valleys.  Ecology In Costa Rica, this tree grows at low densities in the forest, but the seedlings are shade tolerant, and natural regeneration rates are high. It often grows in association with the oil tree Pentaclethra macroloba, the almond Dipteryx panamensis and the mahogany Carapa guianensis. The seeds are eaten by pacas, agoutis and deer and are believed to be dispersed by rodents and bats. The fruit pulp is consumed by parrots and peccaries. The wet forest in which it grows has a biodiverse fauna of reptiles and amphibians.  Uses The sapwood is a creamy colour and fibrous, while the heartwood is dark brown when fresh and reddish brown when dried. The timber is resistant to marine boring invertebrates and is used for shipbuilding, bridges, and general and marine construction. It is also used to make furniture, tool handles, and posts. The bark can be used in tanning and has various other uses. The seeds can be eaten, but excessive consumption causes loss of hair. They are also used in northern Costa Rica to make sweets and caramel and in Panama as folk medicine to treat pneumonia and diarrhoea.   == References ==

Andualem Aragie (Amharic: አንዱዓለም አራጌ; born 4 November 1972) is an Ethiopian politician and activist who is the Deputy Leader of Ethiopian Citizens for Social Justice (ECSJ), an opposition party formed after the merger of 7 smaller opposition parties in May 2019. He was formerly the Vice President and Press Secretary for the Ethiopian-based Unity for Democracy and Justice Party (UDJP). Andualem was sentenced to a life sentence on terrorism charges after being imprisoned on September 14, 2011 along with prominent journalist Eskinder Nega and opposition party members and reporters.  His arrest has been ascribed by human rights organizations as a crackdown on dissent.  Human Rights Watch also reported his detention as well as other members of the opposition and the potential for serious abuse during his imprisonment. He is now released from prison after the government pardoned him and other prisoners of conscience.  Early life Childhood, education and career Aragie was born in Fart'a county, Gondor, Ethiopia.  He was the first son (second child) of Aragie Wale and Kassanesh Gebeyehu.  He attended Meskerem Elementary School, Addis Ababa, while living with his Aunt. Aragie initially attended Kokebe Tsibah High School in Addis Ababa finishing grades nine and ten, but transferred to Saint Joseph High School in Ethiopia, when he won a competitive scholarship. Upon graduation in 1996, he went on to study history at Addis Ababa University.  In 1999, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history. His first job after graduation was at the World Bank where he was a researcher.  He later worked for the Ethiopian Economic Association.  Politics Aragie started his political career in 2000 as a founding member of the Ethiopian Democratic Party (EDP).  He was later elected to the position of Deputy General Secretary of EDP.  In 2005, he was an officer of a large coalition of opposition parties formally known as the Coalition for Unity and Democracy or informally as Kinijit.  The Kinijit was made up of the All-Ethiopian Unity Party, the Ethiopian Democratic Party, the Rainbow Party, and the Ethiopian Democratic League Party. In 2005, he ran for parliament representing his district in South Gondar Zone and the Coalition for Unity and Democracy. He also participated in some of the election debates representing the CUD, as reported at the time by Addis Fortune.   In the election disputes that followed shortly after the Ethiopian government announced that it had won the election and banned demonstrations, Mr. Aragie was imprisoned for more than two years at Kaliti Prison along with journalists, more than 200 opposition party leaders, independent election observers, and civil society activists.  International election observers, while praising the lead up to the elections, mostly condemned the election results which the opposition claimed to have won both at the national, local, and parliamentary level.  The Carter Center declared that "there were a considerable number of the constituency results that had significant problems and whose credibility was in question."  The European Union Election Observation Mission started its final report by stating that "EU observers witnessed cases that suggested serious irregularities with election results, including figures that were implausible. After his negotiated release from prison in 2007, along with the rest of opposition members, he continued his political career by co-founding, on June 20, 2008, the Unity for Democracy and Justice party.  In 2009, he was elected Vice President and Press Secretary of the new party.  Andualem ran for parliament representing UDJ. Andualem remained the Vice Chair and the Head of Public Relations of his party until his re-arrest and imprisonment by the Ethiopian government on September 14, 2011 on terrorism charges.  Despite international pressure for his release from the European Union and the United States of America, he was sentenced to life in prison on June 27, 2012. The official government news agency also announced the guilty verdict stating that the defendants "were attempting to dismantle the constitution." In May 2019, he was elected the Deputy Leader of Ethiopia Citizens for Social Justice (ECSJ).  World reaction to imprisonment Human Rights Watch, September 16, 2011, called for his release. Amnesty International, September 16, 2011, called on the Ethiopian government to end crackdown on government critics, listed Mr. Aragie as one of the victims of the government crackdown  Current status Andualem was freed along other journalists on April 5, 2018.

The Czech Statistical Office (abbreviated CSO or CZSO; Czech: Český statistický úřad, abbreviated ČSÚ) is a central state administration authority of the Czech Republic. It is an office independent of the country's government, whose main tasks are the collection, processing and dissemination of statistical data and the organization of elections in the Czech Republic and the population census.  History The beginnings of the organized statistical service in Czechoslovakia date to 28 January 1919, when the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic approved the Act on the Statistical Service (No. 49/1919 Coll. of Laws n. "on the organization of the statistical service"). The law defined the newly office called State Statistical Office as a state institution with its rights and obligations. The main task of the office was the collection and publication of basic demographic, social and economic data on the development of Czechoslovak society. Dobroslav Krejčí became the first president of the office. In 1961, the State Statistical Office and the Central People's Control Commission were merged into the Central Office of State Control and Statistics. The State Statistical Office became independent again in 1967, but already in 1969 it was transformed into the Federal Statistical Office. The Czech Statistical Office was founded in 1969, when it was created by the Act of the Czech National Council No. 2/1969 as a body of the Czech Socialist Republic. After the partition of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Statistical Office took over some of the duties of the Federal Statistical Office. In 1995, the obligations and competences were revised by the new Act No. 89/1995 Coll. on the State Statistical Service.  Competence of the office The competence of the Czech Statistical Office is defined by Act No. 89/1995 Coll. The most important tasks of the office include:  Determination of the methodology of statistical surveys and taking care of statistical surveys; Compilation of national accounts; Creation of macroeconomic analysis and analysis of selected characteristics of the social, economic, demographic and ecological development of the Czech Republic and its regions; Publishing and providing statistical information; Monitoring of statistics on the state and movement of the population and projection of the demographic development; Cooperation with international organizations, participation in the creation of statistics of the European Union; Organization of elections in the Czech Republic; Coordination of the state statistical service, which is carried out by the ministries; Administration of the basic register of people.  Office seat Until 2002, the Czech Statistical Office was based in Prague 8-Karlín. As a result of the 2002 European floods, the building was destroyed and the office moved to a new building in Prague 10-Strašnice, which was opened on 29 January 2004. In addition to the headquarters, the office has a branch in every region of the Czech Republic.

The Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA), Port San Antonio, Texas (Lackland Annex), oversees execution of the Air Force Surgeon General policies supporting Air Force expeditionary capabilities, healthcare operations, and national security strategy. It provides expert consultative leadership support to 75 military treatment facilities and eleven major commands/direct reporting units to ensure cost-effective, modern, and prevention-based healthcare continuum for 2.1 million beneficiaries worldwide. The AFMOA directs and supports the clinical currency of 43,131 healthcare professionals providing 6.6 million visits and 133,500 bed days. The agency provides clinical and population health data and analysis to AF/SG and MAJCOM surgeons. The agency partners with the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.  History The Air Force Medical Operations Agency sprang from the ashes of the former flight medicine department of the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) in 1992. Though it originally cared for operational matters under the direction of the AF/SG (Surgeon General) as a field-operating unit, as AFMS duties changed, so did those of the AFMOA. The AFMS moved to more of a proactive approach, managing population health rather than episodic care to improve the health and lives of Air Force members and their families. This in turn led to an increase in AFMOA responsibilities; the Agency expanded to optimizing medical resources, radiation protection, aerospace medicine, and clinical excellence, among other interests. AFMOA was inactivated on June 28, 2019, alongside the Air Force Medical Support Agency, and their functions were consolidated into the new Air Force Medical Readiness Agency.  Products and Customers AF/SG Implement SG policy, provide expertise needed for policy development, and precise application of resources to requirements  MAJCOM/SGs Support MAJCOM Surgeons by addressing healthcare resourcing and operations issues pertinent to their missions  MTF/CCs Provide resources, coordinate best processes, data analysis, and clinical expertise for efficient patient-centered healthcare  Air Force Medical Service Logo - "Air Force Medicine: Trusted Care...

Books Foley's most recent book is The Tea Party: Three Principles (Cambridge University Press, February 2012; ISBN 978-1-107-01135-9), In it, she challenges the media's characterization of the American Tea Party movement, asserting that it has been distorted in a way that prevents meaningful political dialogue and may even be dangerous for America's future. Foley sees the Tea Party as a movement of principles over politics. She identifies three "core principles" of American constitutional law that bind the decentralized, wide-ranging movement: limited government, unapologetic U.S. sovereignty, and constitutional originalism. These three principles, Foley explains, both define the Tea Party movement and predict its effect on the American political landscape. Foley explains the three principles' significance to the American founding and constitutional structure. She then connects the principles to current issues as health care reform, illegal immigration, the war on terror, and internationalism. Foley's prior books include The Law of Life and Death (Harvard University Press, 2011; ISBN 978-0-674-05104-1), which examines the many, and surprisingly ambiguous, legal definitions of what counts as human life and death. The book was the basis for a Tedx talk, "When are you really dead?," delivered in fall 2012. In the book, Foley reveals that "not being dead" is not necessarily the same as being alive, in the eyes of the law. She also explains how the need for more organ transplants and the need to conserve health care resources are exerting steady pressure to expand the legal definition of death. As a result, death is being declared faster than ever before. The "right to die," Foley worries, may be morphing slowly into an obligation to die. Her first book, Liberty for All: Reclaiming Individual Privacy in a New Era of Public Morality (Yale University Press, 2006; ISBN 978-0300109832), asserts that there is a "morality of American law", defined by the twin principles of limited government and residual individual sovereignty. These twin principles, moreover, reveal that there is a harm principle that animates American law and defines the moral use of governmental power to restrict individual liberty. In December 2006, the book won the Lysander Spooner Award for advancing the literature of liberty.  Media appearances Foley is a frequent commentator on constitutional and health care law for American media, including CNN, Fox News, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and Instapundit.

Destiny in Sydney: An epic novel of convicts, Aborigines, and Chinese embroiled in the birth of Sydney, Australia is the first historical novel in a three-book series about Sydney, Australia by American writer D. Manning Richards. It was published in 2012 and was followed by the second serial book, Gift of Sydney, in 2014. Destiny in Sydney begins in 1787 in Scotland and ends in 1902, covering 126 years of Australian history. The family saga story follows three fictional families: Scots-Irish, Aboriginal, and Chinese, who interact with real-life historical figures to dramatize the major events and conflicts in Australian history. Richards writes “The history is largely accurate . . . based on recorded history . . . from well over two hundred sources.” The appendix lists ninety primary references and includes a discussion of “Fact or Fiction?” by chapter that tries to anticipate readers’ questions.  Origin and inspiration Author D. Manning Richards lived and worked in Sydney, Australia for three years (1973–75) during a period of unprecedented reforms by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, which included returning title ownership to part of the Gurindji indigenous people's ancestral lands, removing the last vestiges of the White Australia policy, and establishing relations with China. Destiny in Sydney was inspired by the author’s desire to understand the history of Australia, especially its European birthplace, Sydney, and its gradual contentious movement toward multiculturalism. His curiosity led to years of researching the history of Australia, including reading nine of the twelve personal journals of the First Fleet, which placed the first convicts in Australia in 1788.  Plot summary In 1787, Scottish marine Lieutenant Nathaniel Armstrong is in charge of convicts on one of the eleven ships sent in the First Fleet to voyage from England to the other side of the world to establish a British penal colony. He lusts after fiery Irish convict Moira O’Keeffe and surprises himself when he falls in love with her. Together, they nearly starve in Sydney Cove while learning to farm the harsh land and deal with the Aborigines, who suffer from the Europeans' diseases and unequal warfare. Armstrong descendants deny their convict heritage and oppose the Chinese who come for the gold rush. Three Fong brothers suffer violence and despair as they fight to forge a place for themselves. Duncan Armstrong, rich and powerful, helps pass the White Australia Policy in 1901 that greatly restricts Chinese immigration and encourages Chinese Australians to leave, while his cousin Eleanor works for women’s suffrage and a “fair go” for Aboriginal Australians.  Major themes Destiny in Sydney is a multigenerational historical novel, and, therefore, because it encompasses 126 years of family sagas and both Sydney and national history, the story has multiple themes: hardships of settlement and development, historical drama-action-adventure, mistreatment of convicts, (as well as Indigenous Australians and Chinese), forming a democratic European government, and the effects of the White Australia policy.  Reception Destiny in Sydney has received many positive reviews.  Midwest Book Review is typical in recommending the epic historical novel for “telling the story of individuals finding love where they least expect it, coping with their troubled convict heritage, the plagues of racism, and struggles with the indigenous people who truly own the continent."  Main historical figures The novel is unusual in the way it weaves real-life historical figures and fictional characters into the narrative of actual historical events that tell the story of Sydney and Australia, including the effects of European racism against the indigenous people and Chinese immigrants. The story is often told through the words and thoughts of the first five governors of New South Wales: Arthur Phillip, John Hunter, Philip Gidley King, William Bligh, and Lachlan Macquarie. A particularly interesting incident, the Rum Rebellion in 1808 dramatizes the overthrow of the government of Governor William Bligh (the Captain Bligh of the Mutiny on the Bounty). An extraordinary personality, John Macarthur, the "Father of Australian Wool," was behind the coup of Bligh and was an antagonist of all five of the early governors. His remarkable wife Elizabeth Macarthur also is important to the storyline. The principal Aboriginal historical figures Arabanoo, Bennelong, Pemulwuy, and Colebee were all real people as were the secondary Indigenous Australians: Nanbaree, Booroong, Yemmerrawanne, Gooroobaroobooloo, Tedbury, and Bungaree. Nearly all of the events in the novel involving these notable Aborigines are based on incidents described in the journals of the time and historical narratives. The life of the fictional Chinese elder Ts’ing Kwong-tang borrows from the remarkable life of the popular Sydney leader Mei Quong Tart.  Main fictional characters Nathaniel Armstrong - The central character who begins the Armstrong family line as a Scottish marine lieutenant but becomes a rich landowner and diplomatic advisor to governors. Moira O’Keeffe - Irish convict who is Nathaniel’s housekeeper and then wife, who grows into a woman of self-assurance, elegance, and community service. Arthur Armstrong - Meek son, Royal Botanic Gardens botanist, who travels with naturalist Charles Darwin to the Outback. Charles Armstrong - Difficult, hard-drinking son, becomes rich sea captain. Duncan Armstrong - Charles’s son, gold mining wealth leads to high positions in Parliament. Eleanor Armstrong - Arthur’s daughter, real estate developer, suffragette, and supporter of Aboriginal causes. Fong Sing-woo - Eldest brother responsible for brothers’ gold mining efforts, religious instruction, and family cohesion. Fong Ho-teng - Fun loving but lazy brother, who becomes a disillusioned opium drug addict. Fong Min-chin - Naive youngest brother who goes on to build Fong family line in Australia.

OurSay is a social media group based in Melbourne, Australia that focuses on participation in public debate. The organization actively reaches 2 million  Australians as of September 2016 primarily located in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.  History OurSay was founded by Eyal Halamish, Matthew Gordon, Gautam Raju, Linh Do and Hedda Ransan-Elliott and launched in Melbourne, Australia in August 2010 during the Australian federal elections where members of the public posted and voted for questions on the OurSay website and political candidates for the federal electorate of Melbourne Adam Bandt and Cath Bowtell responded to the top questions. Then finance minister and federal member for Melbourne Lindsay Tanner resigned from his political career and declined to participate in the OurSay forum. In November 2010, OurSay executed its second forum in Brunswick, Victoria, where citizens in the electorate of Brunswick, posted and voted for questions to political candidates Jane Garrett, Phil Cleary, and Cyndi Dawes. Citizens were invited to a local pub where the most voted for questions on OurSay were asked and responses were live video recorded and uploaded to the site. This presented the essence of OurSay, integrating online and offline citizen engagement with decision-makers. From November 2010 to August 2012, OurSay experimented with the execution of its technology and offline engagement. Some experiments included a partnership with Q&A (Australian talk show), where a top question asker posed their question on national television  and the Climate Agenda, where a senior reporter at The Sunday Age reported on the most voted for questions about climate change  on OurSay for 10 consecutive weeks. OurSay was reviewed by media expert and academic Margaret Simons as a new model for journalism where the audience is driving the content. In July 2012, OurSay hosted a forum with Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard, the first national head of state to participate. OurSay partnered with Google+, Fairfax Media, Deakin University, and the office of the Prime Minister of Australia. In July 2016, OurSay secured a seed round of capital investment to improve its platform and tailor it specifically for the local government market as a "self-serve" platform for democracy and public engagement. The current board of directors of OurSay include Eyal Halamish and Matthew Gordon.  References External links Official website Power to the people: A profile about OurSay

El Hadji Ousmane Dabo (born 8 February 1977) is a French former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Dabo played for Rennes, Inter Milan, Vicenza, Parma, Monaco, Atalanta, Lazio, Manchester City and New England Revolution. He represented France three times at full international level.  Early life Dabo was born in Laval, Mayenne. His father Moussa Dabo was a player for the Senegalese national team and Stade Lavallois.  Club career Early career Dabo started his career at Rennes, before he and team-mate Mikaël Silvestre were signed by Inter Milan in 1998. Dabo was not a regular first team player for Inter, and a few months later he was loaned out to Vicenza, where he made 13 Serie A appearances. Dabo spent the following season at Parma under Arrigo Sacchi, making sixteen appearances. In June 2000, Inter stated Silvestre and Dabo were bought for only ₤3 million and sold for ₤30 million. In June 2000 he changed clubs again, returning to the French league with Monaco in an exchange deal involving Sabri Lamouchi. Six months later he returned to Vicenza on loan, and in the close season made a permanent move to Atalanta.  At the Bergamo club he secured regular first team football, and in 2003 he gained a call-up to the France national team for the FIFA Confederations Cup, which Dabo described as "a surprise".  Lazio In summer of 2003 Dabo joined Lazio, along with team-mate Luciano Zauri, at first a co-ownership deal but raised to a total of €3.225 million and €5.65 million transfer fees after Lazio bought duo remain rights in June 2004. Dabo became an important and popular part of the Lazio midfield due to his organised style of play, making 79 appearances for the club.  Manchester City After interest from a variety of Premier League clubs in 2006, Dabo joined Manchester City on a Bosman transfer, signing a three-year contract. Dabo cited a positive impression of the club arising from a friendly between Manchester City and Lazio at the City of Manchester Stadium as one of his main reasons for joining Manchester City. His debut for the club came in the opening match of the season, a 3–0 Premier League defeat to Chelsea. On his third City appearance he received a red card for an aerial challenge with Reading's Steve Sidwell, and was suspended for three matches. However, a knee ligament injury sustained in training resulted in a much longer absence, and he did not make another appearance until mid-December. He then had a run of thirteen consecutive appearances, but was sidelined by injury. Upon his return to fitness he struggled to regain his place in the team, making only one further appearance in the 2006–07 season.  Confrontation with Joey Barton On 1 May 2007, Dabo was assaulted by his team mate Joey Barton at City's training ground. Dabo stated that he had been hit several times, and had to go to hospital after suffering injuries to his head during the incident, including a suspected detached retina.  Dabo requested that the police press charges against Barton, and as a result, on 16 May 2007, Barton was arrested and questioned by Greater Manchester Police. Barton pleaded guilty to the assault. Barton later claimed on 8 April 2011 that, in fact it was Dabo who started the fight, and he was merely defending himself. After Barton signed for Marseille on 1 September 2012 on a season-long loan, Dabo questioned the arrival of the Englishman at the Rhone club and called his former teammate a coward for constantly hitting him when he was face down on the floor.  Return to Lazio He was put on the transfer list by Sven-Göran Eriksson along with team mates Danny Mills and Paul Dickov. Mills and Dickov both ended up going out on loans, but Dabo remained at the club. After just playing the League Cup game on 29 August 2007, he finally re-signed for Lazio on 30 January 2008, cost only €263,000. He signed a contract until 30 June 2010. On 13 May 2009, he scored the winning penalty in a penalty shoot-out to give Lazio a 6–5 win after a 1–1 draw, over Sampdoria in the 2009 Coppa Italia Final.  New England Revolution After seven months without a club, Dabo signed with Major League Soccer club New England Revolution on 8 February 2011. He made his MLS debut on 7 May 2011 in a game against the Colorado Rapids. Dabo retired from football on 18 July 2011 after struggling with injuries throughout the 2011 MLS season.

Kasaan Peninsula lies between Clarence Strait and Kasaan Bay in the U.S. state of Alaska. It forms a cut out from the eastern coast of Prince of Wales Island on the south, and by Tolstoi Bay and Thome Bay on the north. A low mountain range forms the backbone of the peninsula, with altitudes ranging from 1,500–2,000 feet (460–610 m). The southern and western shore line is abrupt and almost unbroken, and has practically no shelter from southeasterly storms which sweep up Kasaan Bay. The northeastern coast of the peninsula also rises abruptly from the water, but is broken by a number of indentations, some of which form small harbors. The first discovery of copper deposits in the Ketchikan district was made by the Russians on the southern side of Kasaan Peninsula. Kasaan is the largest settlement on the peninsula.  Topography Kasaan Peninsula is a promontory on the east side of Prince of Wales Island that includes about 60 square miles (160 km2)square miles. From Clarence Strait, it appears to be an island whose summits are highest near its central part and diminish in height toward the north and south. A neck of low land between the head of Kasaan Bay and the south end of Thorne Bay connects the peninsula with Prince of Wales Island. This low pass appears to represent the continuation of a valley, from 8–10 miles (13–16 km) wide, which is a tributary to the north branch of Thorne Bay and extends northwestward through the center of Prince of Wales Island. Kasaan Bay occupies the south end of this valley. In the northward extension of this valley and on the low pass south of Thorne Bay, there are many small lakes and morainal deposits. The highest point on the peninsula is the top of Kasaan Mountain, which has an altitude of 2,840 feet (870 m). The other mountains average about 2,000 feet (610 m) in height and their slopes are deeply dissected by small valleys and by narrow steep-sided gulches.  Erosion On Kasaan Peninsula, there are many flat areas, some of them containing small lakes, and the mountain slopes themselves are interrupted by benches or terraces, which occur at different elevations and at rather regular intervals above sea level. These benches represent levels of erosion. The lowest bench level is indicated by a series of flats or forelands at a height of about 50 feet (15 m) above sea level. Forelands at this height are especially prominent at the head of Kasaan Bay and on the adjacent islands. Along the northern shore of the peninsula and in Tolstoi Bay, a higher level of erosion, which seems persistent at 100–150 feet (30–46 m) on many parts of the peninsula, is marked by wide flats in the valleys, some of which are occupied by small lakes. Such flats occur just north of Grindall Point; on the hills just north of Kasaan; northeast of the Haida mine, where the flat is covered by a lake; on both the east and west slopes of Tolstoi Bay; and southwest of Thorne Bay, where there are two large lakes. Still higher, at an elevation of 250–300 feet (76–91 m), a level of erosion is represented by a flat, occupied by a lake, at the head of Poor Mans Creek, on the divide toward Tolstoi Bay; by flats north of the Alarm claim, on which there are several lakes; and by several areas occupied by lakes northeast of the Haida mine. The surface of the lake just east of Lake Three, at the head of Kasaan Bay, and that of the lake below the Goodro mine are also at this elevation. The next or fourth series of benches and flats are prominent at an elevation of about 500 feet (150 m) above sea level. At this level also there are lakes, from which small streams flow down through gulch-like valleys to lower levels. At this altitude, there are terraces along the north slope of the southwest half of the peninsula, flats south of Hadley, a low pass across the peninsula southwest of Lyman Anchorage, and the lakes and flats on the divide from Windfall Harbor to Tolstoi Bay and east of the It mine. Most of the summits of the hills north of the It mine and adjacent to the Salt chucks at the head of Kasaan Bay are at an elevation of about 500 feet (150 m). Higher levels of erosion are indicated at elevations of 1,100–1,300 feet (340–400 m) by lakes and flats in the central portion of the southeast half of the peninsula, by flats that are in part occupied by lakes on Mount Andrew and on the mountain just west of Lyman Anchorage, and at the head of a branch of Tolstoi River. Other lakes at an altitude of about 1,500 feet (460 m) north of Grindall Point Mountains and north of Kasaan Mountain may mark a higher erosion level. The highest relatively level areas stand at an altitude of about 1,850 feet (560 m), on the Grindall Point Mountains, where there are also small lakes, and also on the ridge southeast of Kasaan Mountain and on Tolstoi Mountain.  Glaciation The mountain mass of Kasaan Peninsula exhibits characteristic glaciated topography. The entire peninsula was at one time overridden by ice streams is evident from the glacial erratics which lie on the highest summits, the moraine deposits which occur on the lower levels, and the many basins which stand at various elevations on the mountain slopes and are now occupied by lakes. During the period in which this area lay beneath the ice many of the minor topographic features, such as the earlier erosion level, were partly destroyed. Some of the valleys were more deeply eroded, lake basins were formed, and wide areas of glacial silt and debris were laid down. This section of the ice stream is well represented in the northern extension of the valley of Kasaan Bay, which is occupied by a chain of connecting lakes, on the sides of which thick beds of glacial clay and debris have been exposed by subsequent stream erosion. This valley probably represents a preglacial river floor, and only the lake basins and minor physiographic features can be attributed to ice erosion. Erosive action subsequent to the ice period has formed the gulches and ravines which are everywhere prominent on the mountain slopes. Another noteworthy feature of Kasaan Peninsula is its precipitous southwest slope, which is much steeper than that on the northeast. This difference may be due to the fact that the ice stream remained longer in the valley of Kasaan Bay than in that of Clarence Strait, the action of the ice tending to deepen the valley and at the same time to protect the mountain slopes from surface erosion.  Flora Kasaan Peninsula is densely forested with spruce and hemlock, principally hemlock, which extends to elevations of 1,500–1,800 feet (460–550 m) The timber, especially that on the southwest side, toward Grindall Point, is large and straight. The mountain side is steep down to salt water. The mountain summits and ridges above timber line are fairly open and bear relatively little vegetation as compared with that of the densely forested lower levels, groups of scrubby pine and juniper and a low berry bush being the principal plants found.  Conservation Prince of Wales Island was included in the Tongass National Forest, but in 1908 that portion of Kasaan Peninsula, which lies south of the Hole in the Wall, was taken out of the national forest.

Adolphus Frederick Hubbard  (ca. 1785 – 27 August 1832) was an American politician. Between 1822 and 1826 he served as Lieutenant Governor of Illinois.  Life Adolphus Hubbard was born in Warren County in Kentucky. At the time of his birth this area still belonged to Virginia. In his early years he moved to Shawneetown in the Illinois Territory, which became the state of Illinois in 1818. He studied law and practiced as a lawyer. Hubbard joined the Democratic-Republican Party and became a member of the constitutional convention. In 1820, he was a member of the Electoral College, voting for James Monroe. In 1822 Hubbard was elected to the office of the Lieutenant Governor of Illinois. He served in this position between 5 December 1822 and 6 December 1826 when his term ended. In this function he was the deputy of Governor Edward Coles. Hubbard was very ambitious. He tried unsuccessfully to be appointed to the U.S. Senate. In 1825 Governor Coles was absent from the state for several weeks and Hubbard fulfilled his duties during this time. After the return of the Governor Hubbard was not prepared to step down to his original position as Lieutenant Governor. He constructed some arguments that would allow him to officially execute the functions of the state's Governor. The case was brought to Court and Hubbard's claim was rejected. In 1826 Hubbard ran unsuccessfully in the regular elections for the Governor's office. After the end of his term as Lieutenant Governor Hubbard did not held any other political offices. He died on 27 August 1832 in Quincy in Illinois.  External links The Political Graveyard Online Biography

The 2014–15 season was Arsenal's 23rd season in the Premier League and 89th consecutive season in the top flight of English football. The club participated in the Premier League, FA Cup, Football League Cup, FA Community Shield and the UEFA Champions League. Arsenal finished third in the Premier League and won both the FA Community Shield and the FA Cup. Arsène Wenger, club manager since 1996, signed several players in the preseason, including Chilean winger Alexis Sánchez from Barcelona, who would be the team's top scorer and win Arsenal Player of the Season. Wenger led the "Gunners" through a turbulent start with player injuries and poor form placing the side as low as eighth in December. In the second half of the season, Arsenal found good form, challenging for the Premier League title with an eight game winning streak in the latter stages. However, following a nil-all draw in April with eventual champions Chelsea, Arsenal all but lost their chances at winning the title. Arsenal repeated their 2014 victory, winning the 2015 FA Cup final 4–0 against Aston Villa; thus becoming the most successful team outright in the FA Cup, with a total of 12 titles. In the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal finished second in their group behind Borussia Dortmund on goal difference. Arsenal was eliminated on away goals over two legs against the Ligue 1 side Monaco in the round of 16. It was the fifth consecutive season Arsenal left the competition in the round of 16 phase.  Background The 2014–15 season marked Arsenal's 23rd consecutive year in the Premier League, their 111th season in the English top flight, and their 89th consecutive season in the tier. This season the club extended the record for the longest continuous run in the top flight which began with their promotion in the 1919–20 season. During the previous season, Arsenal finished fourth in the Premier League behind Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool; the club won the FA Cup after defeating Hull City in the final. Additionally, they finished in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League and the fourth round of the Football League Cup. Ahead of the new season, the club announced that playing kits would be manufactured by German sportswear company Puma, after a 20-year association with Nike came to an end. The club also announced an increase in their ticket prices of 3% in line with inflation. Long term manager Arsène Wenger, who joined the club in 1996, extended his contract with the club through May 2017. Arsenal chairman Chips Keswick commentated on how Wenger "has established Arsenal for its exciting playing style around the world", and that he has "no doubt [Arsenal] have an exciting future ahead of [them] with him leading the team".  Summer transfer window On 26 June 2014, Arsenal announced that 11 players would depart the club on 30 June at the conclusion of their contracts. The list included loanees Kim Källström and Emiliano Viviano, along with players who signed pre-contract agreements: Łukasz Fabiański (Swansea City), Bacary Sagna (Manchester City), Zak Ansah (Charlton Athletic), Zachari Fagan (Welling United), and Chuks Aneke (Zulte Waregem). The list of players also included Leander Siemann, Nicklas Bendtner, Park Chu-young and Daniel Boateng. The club transferred a selection of players ahead of the season for undisclosed fees; these players included German midfielder Thomas Eisfeld, Swiss international defender Johan Djourou, and Spanish defender Ignasi Miquel. The club received a £15 million fee from Barcelona for the transfer of Belgian defender Thomas Vermaelen, who left after making 110 Premier League appearances for Arsenal. It was also reported that Arsenal received benefits for selling a selection of contractual rights including clauses with Carlos Vela at Real Sociedad, and Cesc Fàbregas at Chelsea. The club announced the much-anticipated transfer of Chilean forward Alexis Sánchez on 10 July from Barcelona, who joined the club on a long-term contract for a reported transfer fee of £35 million. A week later, French defender Mathieu Debuchy joined the club for an undisclosed fee; he was seen as a direct replacement for the departed Sagna. On 27 July, Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina signed for Arsenal from French club Nice for a reported transfer fee of £3 million, replacing former goalkeeper Fabiański, who had ended his contract. The club announced the signing of English defender Calum Chambers from Southampton on 28 July; his transfer fee was reported to cost the club £16 million. Wenger admitted that Chambers' transfer fee was a gamble for a young player, but he had faith in the player to demonstrate his versatility whilst at the club. Arsenal's final first-team summer signing was Danny Welbeck, his transfer from Manchester United was reported to have cost Arsenal £16 million. During the summer transfer window, a variety of players left the club on loan, this included first-team players such as Carl Jenkinson to West Ham United, and Francis Coquelin to Charlton Athletic.  Pre-season In preparation for their season, Arsenal played Conference South side Boreham Wood at their home stadium Meadow Park. The "Gunners" defeated Boreham Wood 2–0 with players who did not attend the 2014 FIFA World Cup; the team won comfortably with goals from academy players Kristoffer Olsson and Benik Afobe. Arsenal then travelled to Harrison, United States to play the New York Red Bulls. Former Arsenal player Thierry Henry played against his former club as his side defeated Arsenal 1–0, and Bradley Wright-Phillips, the son of former Arsenal player Ian Wright, scored the only goal against a heavily rotated Arsenal side. In August, Arsenal hosted the 2014 Emirates Cup which was an invitational friendly tournament at the Emirates Stadium with Valencia, Benfica and Monaco participating. Arsenal played Benfica first, defeating the Portuguese side 5–1 with four goals from Yaya Sanogo and a volleyed goal from academy player Joel Campbell. Arsenal then played Monaco, losing 1–0 due to a Radamel Falcao goal. Valencia won the Emirates Cup tournament and Arsenal placed second.  Match details  FA Community Shield Arsenal qualified for the FA Community Shield on virtue of winning the FA Cup during the preceding season; they faced Manchester City, the Premier League champions. In Arsenal's first competitive game of the season, the club defeated Manchester City 3–0 with goals from Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey and Giroud. Wenger was happy with Arsenal's bright start to the season pointing out after the game that his team exhibited a "complete performance"; he also acknowledged the team's flaws, saying that during the second half "we lost a bit more of the ball than in the first half and our movements were less fluent". Match details  Premier League August–October Arsenal began their Premier League season at the Emirates Stadium against Crystal Palace on 16 August 2014. The visitors took the lead through Brede Hangeland's header from a corner in the first half, but Arsenal replied with a Laurent Koscielny equaliser and a late stoppage time winner from Ramsey. Arsenal defeated Crystal Palace, who had a player sent off, and gave the club a winning start to their league campaign. The club then went on a three-game winless run with draws against Everton at Goodison Park, Leicester City at the King Power Stadium, and after the international break, Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium. New signing Sánchez scored his first league goal for the club against Leicester City, but the club also lost Giroud and Debuchy to injury during their winless run. Arsenal's misfortune was momentarily suspended after a comprehensive 3–0 away win over Aston Villa, with a first Arsenal league goal for new signing Welbeck, a calm Mesut Özil finish and an own goal from Villa defender Aly Cissokho. On 27 September, Arsenal faced Tottenham Hotspur in the North London derby at the Emirates Stadium. The match ended in a 1–1 draw; Spurs' Nacer Chadli gave his side the lead early in the second half, but Arsenal responded with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's effort against a wrong-footed Tottenham defence with 15 minutes left in the match. After the game, Wenger voiced his frustration at Arsenal's set-piece routines saying that the players did not create enough from these opportunities; Wenger also mentioned that Ramsey and club captain Mikel Arteta sustained muscular injuries, and they would be temporarily unavailable. Arsenal's misfortune continued when they lost 2–0 against rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, with the "Blue's" Eden Hazard and Diego Costa on the scoresheet. The loss meant the Wenger had not defeated Chelsea manager José Mourinho after 12 different attempts. Arsenal also lost playmaker Özil to injury during the match and could not play for three months.  With the hope of finding good form, the club played Steve Bruce's Hull City after the international break, where the "Gunners" drew 2–2 with Sánchez and Welbeck netting the goals for Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Wenger, frustrated with the result, criticised his players for conceding "too many goals" as a result of a lack of concentration. Arsenal won their final match in October when they defeated Sunderland at the Stadium of Light, capitalising off player mistakes, and the club finished the month in fifth place on the Premier League table.  November–February A Sánchez brace (two goals) and a first senior goal from Chambers helped Arsenal dispatch Sean Dyche's Burnley 3–0 at home on 1 November. The Chilean took his club goal tally to ten goals during the match, Wenger praised Sánchez after the match by comparing the player to Uruguayan forward Luis Suárez in his post-match interview. Travelling to Wales, Arsenal then lost to Swansea City 2–1, after having a one goal lead courtesy of a tidy Sánchez finish. The club's first home defeat came against Manchester United; the 2–1 loss was Arsenal's first and only consecutive defeat in the Premier League during the season. A Kieran Gibbs own goal and a tidy Wayne Rooney finish meant that Giroud's goal in added time was just a consolation; after the match, Wenger called his side "defensibly naive" and also thought the game was "one way traffic" in United's favour. The defeat was a dent in Arsenal's title hopes, given that Jack Wilshere was also injured after a heavy Paddy McNair challenge. The club ended their month positively with a tight 1–0 away win against West Bromwich Albion, courtesy of a Welbeck header. On 3 December, Arsenal defeated Southampton 1–0, and three days later lost 3–2 away to Stoke City. During the game against Stoke, new signing Chambers was sent off after receiving a second yellow card and Wenger was again critical of his side, calling Arsenal "soft". With Giroud and Carzorla scoring braces, Arsenal later defeated Newcastle United 4–1 at the Emirates Stadium to recover from their defeat to Stoke City. Arsenal then travelled to Anfield to play a struggling Liverpool side who were placed mid-table; the "Gunners" drew 2–2 with Liverpool with Philippe Coutinho and Martin Škrtel scoring the goals for the "Reds". On Boxing Day, Arsenal defeated Queens Park Rangers 2–1, and later dispatched West Ham United on 28 December to end 2014 with a victory. On 5 January 2015, Arsenal sent Lukas Podolski on loan to Inter Milan for the remainder of the season; Podolski had not started a Premier League game for Arsenal during the season, and had only made four appearances in Arsenal's UEFA Champions League group stage campaign. Arsenal also loaned Yaya Sanogo to Crystal Palace for the remainder of the season, the Frenchman had only made five appearances for Arsenal during the season. To reinforce the squad, the club signed Gabriel Paulista from La Liga side Villarreal for £11.2 million. In the three games Arsenal played in January, they lost 2–0 to Southampton away, defeated Stoke City 3–0 at the Emirates Stadium, and dispatched Manchester City 2–0 at the City of Manchester Stadium. In the game against Stoke, Sánchez was involved in all three goals, assisting Koscielny's header and scoring the other two; the match also saw Özil appear as a substitute, having returned from injury. Wenger said that Arsenal's performance in their 2–0 win over Manchester City was "exceptional". Cazorla scored the opening goal from a penalty and later set up Giroud's goal from a free-kick; it was Arsenal's first win at Manchester City since October 2010. In February, Arsenal defeated Aston Villa 5–0 at the Emirates Stadium in what would be Arsenal's largest winning margin during the season. The club's good form was interrupted when they lost 2–1 to Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane with Harry Kane scoring both goals for Spurs. In Arsenal's final two matches during the month, they defeated Leicester City at the Emirates Stadium, and dispatched Crystal Palace 2–1 at Selhurst Park.  March–May On 1 March, Arsenal played Everton with Giroud and Tomáš Rosický scoring the goals for the "Gunners" as they won 2–0 at home. January signing Gabriel Paulista also made his first Premier League start during the match. Three days later, Arsenal travelled to Loftus Road to defeat Queens Park Rangers 2–1, with Sánchez ending a run of seven games without scoring. The "Gunners" finished March with a 3–0 home win against West Ham United, and a 2–1 win over Newcastle United; with their victory in Tyneside, Arsenal had won their last six consecutive league games and sat third on the league table, one point behind second-placed Manchester City. Wenger was later voted Premier League Manager of the Month for Arsenal's strong form in March, and Giroud was voted Premier League Player of the Month after he scored five goals in Arsenal's four league matches in the month. On 4 April, Arsenal convincingly defeated Liverpool 4–1 at home, goals from Héctor Bellerín, Özil, Sánchez and Giroud sealed the victory for the "Gunners"; the win saw Arsenal jump to second place on the league table, but were still seven points behind Chelsea in first place – who had a game in hand. After a 1–0 away win over Burnley, Arsenal were set to play a much-anticipated game against Chelsea on 26 April at home. The match ended in a 0–0 draw and thus ended Arsenal's winning run of eight league games; Chelsea later won the Premier League title after their 1–0 win over Crystal Palace on 3 May. Having lost out on the league title, Arsenal looked to secure qualification for the Champions League in their final five league matches. With a win over Hull City, a loss against Swansea City, and two draws against Manchester United and Sunderland, a win in their final game against West Bromwich Albion would secure Arsenal third place and Champions League football for the following season. The "Gunners" ended their season positively after they won 4–1 at home with a Walcott hat-trick and a 20-yard finish by Wilshere.  Match details  League Table FA Cup Arsenal entered the FA Cup as title holders, following their victory over Hull City in the previous edition's final. Their opening tie in January 2015 was a home match against Hull City, a repeat of the previous final; the "Gunners" won 2–0 with a corner set-piece headed in by Per Mertesacker along with a sharp turn and finish from Sánchez. In the following round away against Brighton & Hove Albion, Arsenal prevailed 3–2 with goals from Walcott, Özil and Rosický helping the club reach the fifth round of the competition. In the following month, Arsenal defeated Middlesbrough 2–0 at the Emirates Stadium with both goals scored by Giroud; Gabriel Paulista also made his debut for the club during the match. In the quarter-finals played in March, Arsenal travelled to Old Trafford to play Manchester United. An early goal from Arsenal's Nacho Monreal was cancelled out by Rooney's flying header from Angel Di Maria's cross, the Argentine was later sent off following Welbeck's winner against his former club. Following their victory over Manchester United, the title holders were now "huge favourites" to win the competition.  Arsenal played EFL Championship side Reading in the semi-finals in April at Wembley Stadium, Arsenal gained a first half lead through a Sánchez close range finish. However, a Garath McCleary volley equalised the scoreline in the second half taking the match to extra time; in the 11th minute of extra time, Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici dropped Sánchez's late effort which sealed Arsenal's progression to the final. In Arsenal's final match of the season, they faced Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium on 30 May. The "Gunners" comfortably defeated Tim Sherwood's side 4–0 with goals from Walcott, Sánchez, Mertesacker and Giroud. The win marked the club's 12th FA Cup trophy, which made it the most successful team in the competition's history. Match details  Football League Cup Arsenal entered the Football League Cup in the third round, receiving a bye in the first and second rounds due to the club's Premier League status and participation in European competition. Arsenal left the competition in the third round following a 2–1 home defeat to Southampton. Despite an early goal from Sánchez, goals from Southampton's Dušan Tadić and Nathaniel Clyne meant that the "Saints" qualified for the following round instead of Arsenal. Match details  UEFA Champions League Play-off round Arsenal qualified for the play-off round of the UEFA Champions League on virtue of finishing fourth in the Premier League the preceding season. The club faced a two-legged tie in August 2014 against Turkish side Beşiktaş; the two clubs played a 0–0 draw in Istanbul during the first leg with Ramsey being sent off after having been cautioned twice. In the second-leg at the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal qualified for the group stage after a 1–0 win with Sánchez scoring his first goal for the club and the only goal of the match. Match details  Group stage On 29 August, Arsenal were drawn into group D with German side Borussia Dortmund, Belgium side Anderlecht and Turkish side Galatasaray. In Arsenal's first group stage match in September away against Borussia Dortmund, the German side won 2–0 with goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ciro Immobile; academy graduate Bellerín also made his first start for the club. At the start of October, Arsenal returned to the competition with a comprehensive 4–1 home victory over Galatasaray. Welbeck scored his first senior hat-trick against the Turkish side and Szczęsny was sent off after he fouled Burak Yılmaz, conceding a penalty. With David Ospina starting in goal following Szczęsny's suspension, the "Gunners" later travelled to Belgium to defeat Anderlecht 2–1 with two late goals from Gibbs and Podolski, now halfway through the group stage Arsenal were placed second behind Borussia Dortmund. In November, Anderlecht came to a rain-lashed Emirates Stadium and drew 3–3 with Arsenal who had a 3–0 lead; the goals from Arteta, Sánchez and Oxlade-Chamberlain were cancelled out by one goal from Anderlecht's Aleksandar Mitrović and two from Anthony Vanden Borre. Arsenal qualified for the knockout phase after they defeated Borussia Dortmund 2–0 at home with goals from Sanogo and Sánchez; they later wrapped up their group stage campaign finishing second after a comfortable 4–1 away win over Galatasaray in December. Group D classification  Match details  Knockout phase Round of 16 On 15 December, Arsenal were drawn against Ligue 1 side Monaco for their round of 16 tie. Arsenal faced the prospect of exiting the tournament at this stage after they were defeated convincingly in February 2015 during the first leg at home; Phil McNulty from BBC Sport characterised Arsenal's performance as incompetent and naive. Despite a consolidation goal from Oxlade-Chamberlain, goals from Geoffrey Kondogbia, Yannick Carrasco and former Tottenham Hotspur striker Dimitar Berbatov meant that Monaco had a strong second-leg advantage. Arsenal travelled to the Stade Louis II the following month with the hope of turning the tie around with a two-goal deficit; despite winning the match with an improved performance, the "Gunners" left the competition by the away goals rule having drawn 3–3 on aggregate. Needing to score at least three unanswered goals, Arsenal started strong with Giroud's composed close-range goal in the 36th minute, and they later came close to scoring again before half-time with Welbeck's effort. Ramsey came off the bench to score a late goal in the second half, but the team couldn't score a third despite overwhelming pressure on Monaco's defence. This was the fifth straight season which Arsenal left the Champions League at the round of 16 stage.  Match details  Post season Following Arsenal's season, Sánchez was voted Arsenal Player of the Season by club supporters; the Chilean scored 25 goals for the "Gunners" in his debut campaign. Sánchez was included in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year, and was also voted PFA Fans' Player of the Year, FSF Player of the Year, Facebook Premier League Player of the Year, and Kids' Choice UK's Favourite Footballer. Wilshere's Premier League goal scored against West Bromwich Albion on the final match day was voted BBC Goal of the Season. The online poll was surged with Arsenal supporters from Twitter that voted for Wilshire, who won the award with 34% of votes.

Frank H. Guenther (born April 18, 1964, Kansas City, MO) is an American computational and cognitive neuroscientist whose research focuses on the neural computations underlying speech, including characterization of the neural bases of communication disorders and development of brain–computer interfaces for communication restoration. He is currently a professor of speech, language, and hearing sciences and biomedical engineering at Boston University.  Education Frank Guenther received a B.S. in electrical engineering from the University of Missouri in Columbia (1986), graduating summa cum laude and ranking first overall in the College of Engineering. He received an M.S. in electrical engineering from Princeton University  (1987) and a Ph.D. in cognitive and neural systems from Boston University (1993).  Professional In 1992, Guenther joined the faculty of the Cognitive & Neural Systems Department at Boston University, receiving tenure in 1998. In 2010 he became associate director of the graduate program for neuroscience and director of the computational neuroscience PhD specialization at Boston University.  He joined the Department of Speech, Language, & Hearing Sciences at BU that same year. In addition to his Boston University appointments, Guenther was a research affiliate in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology  from 1998 to 2011, and in 2011 he became a research affiliate in the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory  at MIT. Since 1998 he has been a member of the Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology PhD program in the Harvard University – MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, and since 2003 he has been a visiting scientist in the Department of Radiology at Massachusetts General Hospital. Guenther has given numerous keynote and distinguished lectures worldwide and has authored over 55 refereed journal articles concerning the neural bases of speech and motor control  as well as brain–computer interface technology.  Research Frank Guenther's research is aimed at uncovering the neural computations underlying the processing of speech by the human brain. He is the originator of the Directions Into Velocities of Articulators (DIVA) model, which is currently the leading model of the neural computations underlying speech production. This model mathematically characterizes the computations performed by each brain region involved in speech production as well as the function of the interconnections between these regions. The model has been supported by a wide range of experimental tests of model predictions, including electromagnetic articulometry studies investigating speech movements, auditory perturbation studies involving modification of a speaker's feedback of his/her own speech in real time, and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of brain activity during speech, though some parts of the model remain to be experimentally verified. The DIVA model has been used to investigate the neural underpinnings of a number of communication disorders, including stuttering apraxia of speech, and hearing-impaired speech. In addition to computational modeling and experimental research investigating the neural bases of speech, Guenther directs the Boston University Neural Prosthesis Laboratory, which focuses on the development of technologies that can decode the brain signals of profoundly paralyzed individuals, particularly those with locked-in syndrome, in order to control external devices such as speech synthesizers, mobile robots, and computers. Guenther's team received widespread press coverage in 2009, when they developed a brain–computer interface for real-time speech synthesis that allowed locked-in patient Erik Ramsey to produce vowel sounds in collaboration with Dr. Philip Kennedy (inventor of the neurotrophic electrode used in the study) and Dr. Jonathan Brumberg. He has also made headlines for his research into non-invasive brain–computer interfaces for communication. In 2011, Guenther founded the Unlock Project, a non-profit project aimed at providing free brain–computer interface technology to patients with locked-in syndrome.  Media Frank Guenther's research has been covered extensively in the science and mainstream media, including television spots on CNN News, PBS NewsHour, and Fox News; articles in popular science magazines Nature News, New Scientist, Discover, and Scientific American; and mainstream media coverage in Esquire, Wired, The Boston Globe, MSNBC, and BBC News.

Ray Jerome Baker (December 1, 1880 – October, 1972) was an American photographer, film maker and lecturer.  His photographs are among some of the earliest professional works in Humboldt County, California and later in Hawaii where his work focused on the people of that state.  Biography Baker was born near Rockford, Illinois in 1880. From 1898 until 1903 he lived in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where he studied at Mechanic Arts High School and took his first photographs before attending the University of Minnesota for one semester.  In 1903, he moved to Portland, Oregon and shortly thereafter, in 1904, to Eureka, California.  On his arrival in Eureka, his studio was in a tent until moving into a building at 5th and F Streets where he ran a commercial photography studio and became a lifelong friend of the writer Jack London.  Baker regularly toured southern Humboldt County on a motorcycle in the early 20th century. He met Edith Frost, a local school teacher, at a Socialist meeting in Eureka in 1906; they married shortly thereafter.  Edith Frost Baker's family had holdings around Briceland and Miranda in southern Humboldt; the Bakers would visit them for the rest of their lives.   Baker's photos of southern Humboldt are some of the few images of the early 20th century. During his years living in Humboldt County, Baker built "the Log House" on property that belonged to his mother-in-law who willed it to Baker's only son, Earl Frost Baker.   By 1908 he moved his photography business to a new studio at 825 E Street in Eureka and he took his family to Hawaii for the first time. In August, after his return to Eureka, the Eureka Herald mentioned his name several times in connection with a charge of "taking obscene photographs"; he posted $100 bail and ended up paying a $50 fine.   In 1910 Baker moved to Honolulu with his wife and son. His studio and darkroom was located at 911 Kalakaua Avenue from 1915 until he retired in 1960. Baker remained active as a photographer and travel lecturer until 1959. He produced thousands of photographic images as black-and-white prints, postcards and books, and as glass plates. When lecturing,  Baker used hand-painted lantern slides to dramatize his presentations; he made larger hand-colored glass plates backlit with daylight when exhibited. The glass plate lantern slides and many of the photographs taken by Baker were hand-colored by his wife Edith. Baker traveled to New Zealand and to the U.S. mainland where he visited Mark Twain and Thomas Edison. Otherwise, he spent his time photographing the land, people and plants of Hawaii. He did commercial work for cane and pineapple plantations, and provided tourists arriving on ocean liners with mementos, mostly photographic postcards and bound books of photographs. His photographs appeared in mainstream media, including The National Geographic Magazine, Baker wrote a memoir in 1964, titled Odyssey of a Cameraman. His studies of the Pacific people of Hawaii are an ethnographic and environmental resource. His Racial Patterns in Hawaii and his Familiar Hawaiian Plants, document a changing environment. Ray Jerome Baker died in Honolulu on Friday, October 27, 1972, a funeral was held over his ashes.  Collections and archives Bishop Museum, Honolulu.

Franklin DeWayne Alix (August 6, 1975 – March 30, 2010) was an American rapist, robber, kidnapper, and serial killer who committed at least three murders, two attempted murders, nine robberies, two rapes, and four kidnappings during a crime spree in the late 1990s. Most of his crimes occurred at apartment complexes in Houston, Texas. Alix was sentenced to death for one of the murders and executed in 2010.  Early life Alix was born in Harris County, Texas. As a child, he was active at his church. Alix sang in the choir and taught Sunday school. He later said he was raised in a strict household.  Early crimes In September 1992, Alix tried to steal a bus. He was arrested after a 10-minute chase and received a six-month sentence for theft. On April 8, 1993, Alix stole a woman's car from her driveway. He was later arrested while driving the car. Alix received a three-year sentence for motor theft and was released from prison in 1996. On July 11, 1996, he was stopped for jaywalking in Houston and was found to be illegally carrying a pistol and ammunition. He was convicted of illegally carrying a weapon and was sentenced to 70 days in jail.  Crime spree In August 1997, Alix embarked on a six-month violent crime spree in Houston. Over the course of the crime spree, he committed at least three murders. Alix committed most of his crimes at apartment complexes and kidnapped people by forcing them into car trunks on four occasions. On August 8, Alix allegedly shot 41-year-old Gregorio Ramirez during an attempted robbery in an apartment parking lot. Ramirez's widow identified him as the shooter. On August 15, Alix pumped gas without paying. When he got stuck in traffic and the store owner confronted him, Alix punched the man in the face. On September 2, Alix bumped into a woman's car. When she asked him for his insurance papers, he threw her to the ground and robbed her at gunpoint. He then fled after the woman started screaming and another woman said she was calling the police. On September 29, Alix robbed a woman and kidnapped her at gunpoint as she got out of her car in an apartment parking lot. After forcing her into her trunk and driving off, Alix pulled over and made the woman perform oral sex on him before fleeing. On October 5, Alix fatally shot Selemawi Tewolde in an apartment parking lot. On October 13 he robbed a man at gunpoint at an apartment, and on On November 30 robbed a man getting out of his car in an apartment parking lot and locked him in the trunk. On December 6, Alix stopped a patrolling apartment security guard at gunpoint. He had the security guard turn around and run away. He then fired three shots, hitting the guard in the back. The man survived. On December 19, Alix shot and wounded a townhome security guard after searching for money. Later that day, Alix got out of a car to rob a man in an apartment parking lot. The man got in the car and drove away. He later found a woman in the trunk. The woman said she had been robbed and raped. On January 3, Alix kidnapped 19-year-old Karyl Bridgeford. After forcing her into her car trunk and driving off, Alix threatened her and demanded money. Karyl told him he could take things from her home. Alix threatened Karyl with his gun, saying he would kill her and anyone else in the house if anything went wrong. Alix then searched the home and stole several electronics. He also raped Karyl. As he was ransacking the home, Karyl's 23-year-old brother Eric and his friend suddenly arrived. The two men fled, but Alix chased them and fatally shot Eric. Later that day, Alix pulled over a woman in an apartment parking lot at gunpoint before robbing and kidnapping her. The woman was forced into her car trunk. Alix, who then started driving the car, released her half an hour later. On January 4, Alix robbed a man walking home. Later that day, he robbed and fatally shot 34-year-old Christopher Thomas as he was listening to music in his car outside of his home.  Arrest, trial, and execution On January 6, 1998, officers in Houston arrested Alix. He confessed to killing Eric on videotape and led police to the weapon. Alix was charged with capital murder for killing Eric. Prosecutors announced they would seek a death sentence for him. While in jail awaiting trial, Alix got into two fights with other inmates, one on April 6, 1998, and the other on May 27, 1998. Alix's trial started in August 1998. During the trial, he admitted to kidnapping Karyl but claimed the sex was consensual, the stolen items were gifts, and that he killed Eric in self defense. Alix was found guilty of capital murder on August 26, 1998. During the sentencing phase, the prosecution introduced Alix's prior convictions and evidence of the other crimes he committed. They said he was the poster boy for capital murder and called him a "one-man crime wave". The defense had witnesses testify that Alix was kind when he was younger. One person described him as having been a "typical fun-loving teenager". Alix himself said he committed the crimes under duress, and that a man named Kevin Smith had threatened to kill him if he did not pay a drug debt. Although Texas did not have life without parole at the time, the judge also allowed the defense to tell the jury that if they gave Alix a life sentence, he would not become eligible for parole for 40 years. This meant that Alix would have no chance of release until he was in his early 60s. During his trial, Alix had several outbursts. At one point, he was removed from the courtroom. The jury ultimately recommended a death sentence, and Alix was formally sentenced to death on September 2, 1998. In 2006, the crime lab for Houston Police Department was caught in a controversy over complaints of bad police work and mishandled evidence in multiple cases. In Alix's case, his lawyers argued that DNA evidence did not conclusively connect him to Ramirez's murder. However, an appellate court ruled that this would not have changed the jury's decision, pointing to Alix's lengthy history of violence and other evidence. Alix was interviewed on death row shortly before his execution: Referring to his alleged drug debt, Alix said he had wanted to do the right things in life, but got caught with a bad crowd. He admitted to killing Eric but claimed his gun went off after Eric charged at him. Alix said he did not want to die. He claimed he was remorseful, but said he would not apologize. Alix admitted to some of the robberies, but denied most of the other crimes, including the rapes and all of the other murders. Alix was executed by lethal injection at the Huntsville Unit on March 30, 2010. He declined a last meal. Alix's last words were "I am not the monster they made me out to be. I made lots of mistakes that took your son. I messed up, made poor choices. I'll take it to the grave, I will be at peace. It is what it is. I got peace in my heart." He was pronounced dead seven minutes later. Bridgeford's sister and mother, as well as Thomas's father and sister, witnessed the execution. "Our lives are forever changed but we need to go on", said Bridgeford's mother, Janey. She said she took no pleasure in seeing Alix die and that she forgave him, but understood he might not admit to everything he did. Janey brought a photo of her son to the witness room. "Every photo has been of Alix", she said. "I wanted to put a face to this." Janey said her family had been through a lot of pain and it took two years before she could return to work. Thomas's sister, Fernellifa Jolivette, said she had to forgive Alix to find peace with herself.

"Liv" is the eighth episode of the sixth series of the British teen drama Skins. It premiered on E4 in the UK on 12 March 2012. The episode is told from the point of view of character Liv Malone. Liv has been partying with her new best friend Alex ever since he arrived in Bristol, but then he disappears for a dirty weekend just when Liv needs him most. She reaches out to her other friends, but finds she is excluded from their lives. With nobody to turn to in her hour of need, Liv is forced to face up to the choices she's made and isn't quite as strong as she believed.  Plot Since finding Alex, Liv has been partying non-stop and suppressing her feelings about Grace's death, although she is plagued by occasional visions of her, similar to what Franky and Rich have suffered. After Alex meets an attractive boy named Donovan at a pre-exams party, the two decide to go out to a cottage on the coast together, leaving Liv alone in the house, where she is soon landed with her sister, Maude, by her recently released older sister, Bella. That night, she suddenly begins to suffer a massive stabbing pain in her side, and finds a large lump there, which she is scared might be Uterine cancer or an Ovarian cyst. The pain does not clear up. However, she resists the urge to go to the doctors to find out, and tells only Doug, her headmaster, when he confides in her that he is leaving Roundview to pursue a long sabbatical. With no one else to go to, she attempts to talk to Mini and Franky, but finds that Mini is reluctant to talk to her and she and Franky still have a tense relationship because of the previous incidents with Matty and Nick. After Liv and Franky lock horns in the corridor, and when Liv questions why Franky has never accepted her role in the accident that ultimately led to Grace's death, Franky violently slaps her across the face. Mini decides to tell her about the truth, but Liv interrupts her after she tells her about having had sex with Alo, before she can tell Liv about her pregnancy. She later attempts to talk to Rich, but he is too busy on his revision, which causes her to explode at him for his seeming indifferent to Grace's death. That night, while hanging out in an Occupy Bristol camp, Liv receives a call from Maude telling her that her "friend" is back, and she rushes home, excitedly expecting to see Alex. But when she enters his room, she is aghast to find that it is, in fact, Matty who has returned. Alex returns the next day and runs into Matty for the first time. Liv reluctantly takes him to Mini's house to see Franky - who emphatically tells him that she doesn't want to see him. Liv once again attempts to speak to Mini, but Mini again responds with her usual coldness. However, something in Liv snaps, and she violently punches Mini twice in the face, before Matty drags her off Mini, who subsequently confesses to being pregnant with Alo's baby. Distraught, Liv runs outside, and is once again attacked by the stabbing pain from the lump in her side. The next day, she goes straight to the clinic, but before a doctor arrives, the sympathetic receptionist offers to take a look at the lump. Upon looking at Liv's side, the receptionist tells her that there is no lump there, and when Liv looks, she finds the same thing - the lump was, in fact, imagined by her due to her fear of death, and the stabbing pain was a physical manifestation of her grief at Grace's death. Realising this, Liv breaks down in tears and finally begins to mourn Grace as the receptionist consoles her. The episode ends with Liv, Maude, Doug and Rich visiting Grace's grave.   == References ==

Derek Parish (born January 4, 1999) is an American professional football defensive lineman for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He played college football at Houston.  Early years Parish was born on January 4, 1999, and grew up in Pearland, Texas. He attended Pearland High School and played football while also running track. Despite being named first-team all-district after posting 12.0 sacks in 2016, Parish was not highly recruited, not even placing on Rivals.com's and ESPN's rankings and being a three-star prospect. He committed to play college football for the Houston Cougars.  College career As a true freshman at Houston in 2017, Parish redshirted. Although recruited as a linebacker, his position was quickly changed to defensive end. He appeared in all 13 games the following year, totaling 21 tackles. He played 12 games in 2019, starting four while posting 38 tackles, 5.5 tackles-for-loss and 2.0 sacks. In the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season, Parish played in all eight games, five of which he started, and tallied 25 tackles, 5.5 tackles-for-loss, and 3.5 sacks, the latter two statistics ranking third on the team. Against South Florida that year, he returned a fumble 85 yards for a touchdown. In 2021, Parish started all 14 games and was named second-team All-American Athletic Conference (AAC) after recording 56 tackles, 12.5 tackles-for-loss and 5.5 sacks. At the start of 2022, he underwent hip surgery and later surgery for a broken bone on his hand, the latter requiring him to play with a club on his hand. He was named team captain and in the second game of the 2022 season, against Texas Tech, Parish set the AAC record with 4½ sacks, additionally posting 6.5 tackles-for-loss and a forced fumble, afterwards being named the national defensive player of the week. However, he then suffered a season-ending torn bicep injury in the fourth game of the year. He had posted 20 tackles, 5.0 sacks and 8.5 tackles-for-loss through that point of the season, ranking third-best nationally in the latter two. Parish was able to return in time to play in the East–West Shrine Bowl, at which he changed his position from defensive end to fullback.  Professional career Jacksonville Jaguars Parish was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the seventh round (240th overall) of the 2023 NFL draft. He was waived on August 29, 2023 and re-signed to the practice squad. He was released on October 16.  Toronto Argonauts On January 22, 2024, it was announced that Parish had signed with the Toronto Argonauts as a defensive lineman.  Personal life Parish won an eating competition between his Cougars teammates by eating 7 lbs. (3.175 kg) of steak in one sitting.  References External links Houston Cougars bio Toronto Argonauts bio

In geometry, the circumference (from Latin circumferens, meaning "carrying around") is the perimeter of a circle or ellipse. The circumference is the arc length of the circle, as if it were opened up and straightened out to a line segment. More generally, the perimeter is the curve length around any closed figure.  Circumference may also refer to the circle itself, that is, the locus corresponding to the edge of a disk.  The circumference of a sphere is the circumference, or length, of any one of its great circles.  Circle The circumference of a circle is the distance around it, but if, as in many elementary treatments, distance is defined in terms of straight lines, this cannot be used as a definition. Under these circumstances, the circumference of a circle may be defined as the limit of the perimeters of inscribed regular polygons as the number of sides increases without bound. The term circumference is used when measuring physical objects, as well as when considering abstract geometric forms.  Relationship with π The circumference of a circle is related to one of the most important mathematical constants. This constant, pi, is represented by the Greek letter                         π         .                 {\displaystyle \pi .}     The first few decimal digits of the numerical value of                         π                 {\displaystyle \pi }     are 3.141592653589793 ... Pi is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference                         C                 {\displaystyle C}     to its diameter                         d         :                 {\displaystyle d:}                            π         =                                 C             d                             .                 {\displaystyle \pi ={\frac {C}{d}}.}     Or, equivalently, as the ratio of the circumference to twice the radius. The above formula can be rearranged to solve for the circumference:                                    C                  =         π         ⋅                    d                  =         2         π         ⋅                    r                  .                          {\displaystyle {C}=\pi \cdot {d}=2\pi \cdot {r}.\!}     The ratio of the circle's circumference to its radius is called the circle constant, and is equivalent to                         2         π                 {\displaystyle 2\pi }    . The value                         2         π                 {\displaystyle 2\pi }     is also the amount of radians in one turn. The use of the mathematical constant π is ubiquitous in mathematics, engineering, and science. In Measurement of a Circle written circa 250 BCE, Archimedes showed that this ratio (                        C                    /                  d         ,                 {\displaystyle C/d,}     since he did not use the name π) was greater than 310/71 but less than 31/7 by calculating the perimeters of an inscribed and a circumscribed regular polygon of 96 sides. This method for approximating π was used for centuries, obtaining more accuracy by using polygons of larger and larger number of sides. The last such calculation was performed in 1630 by Christoph Grienberger who used polygons with 1040 sides.  Ellipse Circumference is used by some authors to denote the perimeter of an ellipse. There is no general formula for the circumference of an ellipse in terms of the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse that uses only elementary functions. However, there are approximate formulas in terms of these parameters. One such approximation, due to Euler (1773), for the canonical ellipse,                                                                 x                                2                                                        a                                2                                                         +                                                y                                2                                                        b                                2                                                         =         1         ,                 {\displaystyle {\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}+{\frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}=1,}     is                                     C                                       e               l               l               i               p               s               e                                          ∼         π                                 2                            (                                                   a                                        2                                                     +                                    b                                        2                                                                  )                                          .                 {\displaystyle C_{\rm {ellipse}}\sim \pi {\sqrt {2\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\right)}}.}     Some lower and upper bounds on the circumference of the canonical ellipse with                         a         ≥         b                 {\displaystyle a\geq b}     are:                         2         π         b         ≤         C         ≤         2         π         a         ,                 {\displaystyle 2\pi b\leq C\leq 2\pi a,}                            π         (         a         +         b         )         ≤         C         ≤         4         (         a         +         b         )         ,                 {\displaystyle \pi (a+b)\leq C\leq 4(a+b),}                            4                                                a                                2                                         +                            b                                2                                                         ≤         C         ≤         π                                 2                            (                                                   a                                        2                                                     +                                    b                                        2                                                                  )                                          .                 {\displaystyle 4{\sqrt {a^{2}+b^{2}}}\leq C\leq \pi {\sqrt {2\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\right)}}.}     Here the upper bound                         2         π         a                 {\displaystyle 2\pi a}     is the circumference of a circumscribed concentric circle passing through the endpoints of the ellipse's major axis, and the lower bound                         4                                                a                                2                                         +                            b                                2                                                                 {\displaystyle 4{\sqrt {a^{2}+b^{2}}}}     is the perimeter of an inscribed rhombus with vertices at the endpoints of the major and minor axes.

Devin Miles Haney ( HAY-ni; born November 17, 1998) is an American professional boxer. He has held multiple world championships in two weight classes, including the undisputed championship at lightweight from 2022 to 2023, and the World Boxing Council (WBC) super lightweight title from 2023 to 2024.  Early life Haney was born in San Francisco and lived in Oakland, California as a child, but moved to Las Vegas with his father, Bill Haney, at the age of 14. He started boxing at the age of seven. Haney is a practicing Muslim.  Professional career On February 2, 2018, Haney was scheduled to fight Harmonito Dela Torre in an eight-round opening bout. Dela Torre had problems obtaining a travel visa and subsequently withdrew from the fight. Unable to find an opponent, the date was scrapped. On January 11, 2019, Haney dominated a very tough opponent in Xolisani Ndongeni on the way to a 10-round unanimous decision win. On May 25, 2019, Haney defeated Antonio Moran via a vicious seventh-round knockout, in his first match under the Matchroom banner. On September 13, 2019, Haney defeated Zaur Abdullaev (11–0) to win the vacant WBC interim lightweight title.  WBC lightweight champion In October 2019, Haney became the WBC lightweight champion as he was elevated, after the previous WBC lightweight champion Vasiliy Lomachenko was promoted to "Franchise Champion" by the WBC.  Haney vs. Santiago On the undercard of KSI vs. Logan Paul II in November 2019, Haney made his first title defense against Alfredo Santiago (12–0), and won by unanimous decision. He injured his shoulder during the fight, requiring surgery that would keep him out until the summer of 2020. He maintained the title "champion in recess."  Haney vs. Gamboa On October 2, 2020, it was revealed that Haney would make the second defense of his WBC lightweight title against veteran 39-year-old former featherweight title holder Yuriorkis Gamboa, on November 7, 2020. The bout was held at the Hard Rock Live in Hollywood, Florida, and was broadcast by DAZN. Most media members predicted an easy victory for the reigning champion, which was reflected in the betting odds as well, with most odds-makers having Haney as a -5000 favorite. Haney won the fight by a dominant unanimous decision, with two of the judges awarding him every single round of the fight, while the third judge scored it 118–109 in favor of Haney. Gamboa was deducted a point in the eleventh round for holding. Haney out-landed Gamboa 133 to 84 in total punches, and 82 to 63 in power punches landed.  Haney vs. Linares In what was seen by many as Haney's toughest test of his career so far, Haney made the third defense of his WBC lightweight title against veteran 36-year-old former three-weight world champion Jorge Linares on May 29, 2021. He won by unanimous decision with the judges scoring the bout 116–112, 116–112, 115–113 in his favor. Haney controlled the action for most of the fight, but was hurt when Linares caught him with a powerful right-left combination toward the end of the tenth round. Haney survived the final two rounds largely by tying Linares up and negating his opponent's attempts at trying to engage with him. The crowd voiced their displeasure with what they perceived as excessive clinching by booing Haney when he jumped up on the ropes in celebration immediately after the final bell, as well as booing during the announcement of the official decision.  Haney vs. Diaz Joseph Diaz had been scheduled to defend his WBC interim lightweight title against Ryan García on November 27, 2021, until García withdrew from the fight due to a hand injury. This led to back and forth on social media between Haney and Diaz, culminating in an official announcement on November 3 that Diaz would now be challenging for Haney's full world title on December 4, instead of defending his interim title against García. On the night, Haney defeated Diaz by unanimous decision, with scores of 117–111, 117–111, 116–112 in his favor. After the fight, the victor announced his desire to face unified champion George Kambosos Jr. for all four major world titles in the lightweight division, stating, "Let's do it for all the belts. The real undisputed."  Undisputed lightweight champion Haney vs. Kambosos Jr. In front of a sold-out crowd in Melbourne, Australia in June 2022, Haney defeated George Kambosos Jr. by outpointing and outboxing the Australian fighter to become the first undisputed lightweight champion in the four-belt era. The judges scored the bout 116–112, 116–112, 118–110, all in favor of Haney. The deal for the fight included an automatic rematch clause which Kambosos exercised, with the rematch occurring in October 2022 in Australia.  Haney vs. Kambosos Jr. II Devin Haney and George Kambosos Jr. met in their rematch at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, Australia on October 16, 2022. Haney defeated Kambosos via unanimous decision with the scores of 118–110 (twice) and 119–109.  Haney vs. Lomachenko On March 29, 2023, it was confirmed that Haney would make a second defense of his undisputed lightweight titles against veteran 35-year-old former unified lightweight champion Vasiliy Lomachenko on May 20, 2023, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Paradise, Nevada, U.S. With Lomachenko coming in as the underdog for the first time in his career, much of the bout turned out to be closely contested, with both men finding success, Lomachenko scoring with clean combinations to the head, while Haney countered consistently with solid body shots. Late in the fight, Lomachenko became increasingly dominant, finding particular success in the 10th and 11th rounds. However, Haney rallied to win the final round on all three judges' scorecards. Haney won the fight by controversial decision. However, the decision was greatly disputed, as many onlookers felt Lomachenko had done enough to win, including fellow boxers Shakur Stevenson and Jorge Linares, who had previously predicted a Haney victory. Judge Dave Moretti's scorecard, giving round 10 to Haney despite Lomachenko dominating that round, was heavily criticised. Others argued that as the fight had been close, a narrow result for Haney was not unreasonable. CompuBox punch stats suggested Haney had landed 110 of 405 punches thrown (27%), while Lomachenko landed 124 of 564 (22%), with both boxers outlanding the other in five rounds each, the other two rounds being even. Lomachenko believed he had won and his team subsequently stated they would file an appeal regarding the result. Haney on his part praised Lomachenko, calling him his toughest opponent yet. Regardless of the result, the fight and the performances of both men were widely praised. It was described by multiple accounts as "thrilling", with Lomachenko's display against a substantially younger and larger opponent being highly lauded. Afterwards, Haney was fined $25,000 for violently shoving Lomachenko during the weigh-in faceoffs.  Controversy In April 2020, Haney claimed that he could beat unified lightweight champion Vasiliy Lomachenko during an interview with 78SportsTV. When asked if would "end the hype of Loma", Haney said, "I'll tell you this. I will never lose to a white boy in my life. I don't care what nobody got to say. Fight a white boy 10 times, I'm going to beat him 10 times." Haney was criticized for the comment. After the fight, Haney announced on Twitter, "I'm not racist and I never will be a racist. I'm chasing greatness." He also said he spoke with WBC president Mauricio Sulaimán and "confirmed to him directly my commitment to be a role model and my absolute rejection of discrimination of any kind." Haney's comments were compared to Bernard Hopkins' declaration that he would "never let a white boy beat me" before his loss to Joe Calzaghe.  WBC super lightweight champion Haney vs. Prograis On December 9, 2023, in an almost sold-out Chase Center in San Francisco, California, Haney moved up a weight class and challenged 35 year old Regis Prograis for the WBC super lightweight title. Despite it being his first fight at super lightweight, Haney dominated Prograis from start to finish, winning every round on all three judges scorecards and scoring a knockdown in the third round from a right hand. Haney staggered Prograis several more times in the middle rounds, but seemed reluctant to go for the finish and instead relied on his winning formula of attacking and retreating. Prograis, who received a cut over his nose and swelling around his eye, had no answers for Haney, landing just 36 punches to Haney's 129, according to CompuBox. All three judges scored the fight 120–107 as Haney added another belt to become a two-weight world champion at the age of 25.  Haney vs. Garcia Haney vs Ryan Garcia was signed for April 20, 2024 in Brooklyn, New York, for the WBC super lightweight title. Two days before the fight, Garcia agreed to a wager with Haney that Garcia would pay $500,000 for every pound over the limit should he miss weight. Garcia weighed in over the limit at 143.2 lbs, making the fight a non-title fight and would forfeit up to $600,000 of his purse to Haney. Haney was knocked down three times by Garcia during the 12 round contest, and lost via majority-decision. One judge scored the bout 112–112 but was overruled by scores of 114–110 and 115–109 for Garcia, who outlanded Haney 106–87 in total punches and 95–45 in power punches, according to CompuBox. On June 20th the bout was changed to a no contest, Garcia was fined 1.1 million and suspended for a year due to using Ostarine after taking the plea deal over taking it to trial.  WBC World Champion in Recess On June 24, 2024 it was announced that Devin Haney requested the WBC for "Champion in Recess" status. The WBC unanimously approved his request.

St Augustine's Abbey (founded as the Monastery of SS. Peter and Paul and changed after Augustine's death) was a Benedictine monastery in Canterbury, Kent, England. The abbey was founded in 598 and functioned as a monastery until its dissolution in 1538 during the English Reformation. After the abbey's dissolution, it underwent dismantlement until 1848.  Since 1848, part of the site has been used for educational purposes (used as boarding houses and a library by The King's School, Canterbury) and the abbey ruins have been preserved for their historical value.  From founding until dissolution In 597, Augustine arrived in England, having been sent by the missionary-minded Pope Gregory I to convert the Anglo-Saxons. The King of Kent at this time was Æthelberht or Ethelbert. Although he worshipped in a pagan temple just outside the walls of Canterbury to the east of the city, Ethelbert was married to a Christian, Bertha. According to tradition, the king not only gave his temple and its precincts to St Augustine for a church and monastery, he also ordered that the church to be erected be of "becoming splendour, dedicated to the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, and endowed it with a variety of gifts." One purpose of the foundation was to provide a residence for Augustine and his brother monks. As another, both King Ethelbert and Augustine foresaw the abbey as a burial place for abbots, archbishops, and kings of Kent. William Thorne, the 14th-century chronicler of the abbey, records 598 as the year of the foundation. The monastic buildings were most likely wooden in the manner of Saxon construction, so they could be quickly built. However, building a church of solid masonry, like the churches Augustine had known in Rome, took longer. The church was completed and consecrated in 613. Ca. 624 a short distance to the east, Eadbald, son and successor of Ethelbert, founded a second church, dedicated to Saint Mary which also buried Kentish royalty. The abbey became known as St Augustine's after the founder's death. For two centuries after its founding, St Augustine's was the only important religious house in the kingdom of Kent. The historian G. F. Maclear characterized St Augustine's as being a "missionary school" where "classical knowledge and English learning flourished". Over time, St Augustine's Abbey acquired an extensive library that included both religious and secular holdings. In addition, it had a scriptorium for producing manuscripts.  Dunstan's reform Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury from 959 to 988, influenced a reorganisation of the abbey to conform to Benedictine rule. Buildings were enlarged and the church rebuilt. Dunstan also revised the dedication of the abbey, from the original Saints Peter and Paul, by adding Saint Augustine in 978. Since then, the abbey has been known as St Augustine's.  Invading Danes The invading Danes not only spared St Augustine's, but in 1027 King Cnut made over all the possessions of Minster-in-Thanet to St Augustine's. These possessions included the preserved body of Saint Mildred. Belief in the miraculous power of this relic had spread throughout Europe, and it brought many pilgrims to St Augustine's, whose gifts enriched the abbey.  Norman conquest Following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, William the Conqueror confiscated landed estates, but he respected Church property. At St Augustine's Abbey, the Anglo-Saxon buildings were completely reconstructed in the form of a typical Norman Benedictine monastery. By 1100, all the original buildings had disappeared under a Romanesque edifice. There was further rebuilding as a result of the great fire in 1168. The fire's destruction accounts for the paucity of historical records for the preceding period. From about 1250 onwards was a period of wealth in which "building succeeded building". Boggis's history calls this period a time of "worldly magnificence", marked by "lavish expenditures" on new buildings, royal visits, and banquets with thousands of guests. In addition, the papacy imposed many levies on the abbey. The large debt that was incurred by these expenditures might have swamped the abbey had it not been for generous benefactors who came to the rescue. The cloister, frater (refectory) and kitchen were totally rebuilt. A new abbot's lodging and a great hall were added. In the early 14th century, land was acquired for a cellarer's range (living and working quarters for the cellarer who was responsible for provisioning the abbey's cellarium), a brewhouse, a bakehouse, and a new walled vineyard. A Lady chapel was built to the east of the church.  Fyndon’s Gate The abbey gatehouse was rebuilt from 1301 to 1309 by Abbot Fyndon. It has since been known as the Fyndon Gate or the Great Gate. The chamber above the entrance was the state bed-chamber of the monastery. In 1625, Charles I of England and Queen Henrietta Maria slept in this chamber, following their marriage in Canterbury Cathedral. In 1660, after the Restoration, Charles II and his brothers, the Dukes of York and Gloucester, stayed in the gatehouse on their way to London. Fyndon's gate suffered such damage by German bombs during the Second World War that it had to be rebuilt. The gate faces a small square known since the reign of Charles I as Lady Wootton's Green, after the widow of Edward, Lord Wootton of Marley who lived in the palace until her death in 1658. Statues of Æthelberht of Kent and Queen Bertha stand on the green.  St Anne's Chapel In the 1360s, Juliana Leybourne funded the building of the "Countess's Chapel" or more usually "St Anne's Chapel" that was built on the side of the abbey. This was a small square chapel that had its own buttresses. Within the chapel was the tomb of the Abbot of Bourne who died in 1334 and the Abbot of Colwel who died in 1375. Leybourne was buried in the chapel. She gave the manor of Dene in Thanet to the abbey and a chantry to say daily prayers for her after her death.  Dissolution to present Boggis describes the early 16th century leading up to the Dissolution of the Monasteries as "days of decadence". Although the abbey owned estates throughout Kent amounting to 19,862 acres, Boggis holds that "historical evidence proves conclusively that even if Henry VIII had never dissolved them, the English monasteries were already doomed." The "extortionate exactions" of the Papacy would lead to bankruptcy. However, the English Reformation accompanied by the Dissolution of the Monasteries happened before bankruptcy. The Reformation replaced the Pope (a cleric) with a monarch (a layman). Actions by the Parliament's House of Commons strengthened the power of the laity versus the power of the clergy. These actions were part of the English Reformation’s "great transfer" of power, both economic and religious, from ecclesiastical to secular authorities. As part of the "great transfer", Parliament gave King Henry VIII authority to dissolve the monasteries and confiscate the property for the Crown. The rationale given was "that the religious houses had ceased to apply their property to the specific religious uses for which it was originally given." On 30 July 1538, the King's Commissioners arrived to take the surrender of St Augustine's Abbey. The last abbot and monks complied and left the abbey. The abbey, with its site, its goods, buildings, lands and all other possessions, became the property of the Crown. This dissolution ended over 940 years of monastic presence.  Dismantling During the rest of Henry's reign, St Augustine's Abbey was held by the Crown with some of its buildings converted into a royal residence. However, in other parts of the abbey dismantling and sale of material began in 1541. Some of the stone was used in the fortifications of the Pale of Calais, but more of it was sold locally. The library, containing two thousand manuscripts, was destroyed and the treasure plundered. The royal residence was occasionally used by the monarch as late as the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, during which the buildings were leased to a succession of noblemen. In 1564, Elizabeth leased the palace to Lord Cobham, and in September 1573 she visited Canterbury and lodged at her palace of St Augustine's. On 7 September, her birthday, she attended a ball at the Archbishop’s palace, returning at midnight to St Augustine's. Lord Cobham was a resident of Kent who had served her faithfully as a diplomat and parliamentarian. On the attainder of Lord Cobham for treason in 1603 under the reign of James I, the residence was granted to Robert Cecil, Lord Essenden. After Cecil died in 1612, James I and VI leased the palace to Edward, Lord Wootton of Marley (sometimes spelled "Wotton"), for a yearly rent of £20 13s and 4d. Wootton employed John Tradescant the Elder to lay out formal gardens. In 1618, King James granted a power for seven years to search for "treasure-trove, plate, jewels, copes, vestments, books, and the like, hid, or supposed to be hid, in abbeys, priories, monasteries, churches, chapels, and other places within the realm." As a result the Abbey was searched and some of the land around it was dug. Wootton died in 1626, but Lady Wootton lived on in the palace until her death in 1658. The open space before the gateway is still known as Lady Wootton's Green. Sir Edward Hales (1626–1684) took possession of the property after Lady Wootton’s death, to be followed by his son Sir Edward Hales (1645–1695). Rather than conserving the property, these new owners dismantled the buildings and carried used stones to build a new house at Hales Place. From then on until 1844, the desolation continued until it had engulfed the church, cloister, kitchen, and refectory. Other parts of the site suffered degradation. From 1770 to 1844, the Alfred Beer & Company brewery operated within the abbey precincts. In 1804, a portion of the site was divided into lots and sold. The Great Court was used as a bowling green and skittle ground. Ethelbert's Tower, the remaining tower of the Norman abbey, was taken down in 1822. Robert Ewell, in his Guide to St. Augustine’s Monastery and Missionary College wrote that in the first half of the 19th century, the abbey "reached its lowest point of degradation".  Restoration to present The condition of the abbey did not go unnoticed. In 1844 a rich young landowner, member of parliament, and generous churchman, Alexander James Beresford Hope, visited the ruins, found them deplorable, and bought them. Inspired by the missionary zeal of the Reverend Edward Coleridge, Hope and other donors gave additional money to restore and construct buildings for the establishment of a college to train young men as missionaries in the British colonies. They envisioned a dual purpose for the college: (a) to educate missionaries and (b) to excavate and preserve the abbey remains. St Augustine's Missionary College remained in existence until 1947. However, on the night of 31 May 1942, its buildings were so badly damaged by a German Blitz raid that the College ceased operations. From 1952 to 1967, the Missionary College buildings were used as The Central College of the Anglican Communion. From 1969 to 1976 the college was used by the theological department of King's College London as a base for final year ordination preparation. Since 1976, the college buildings, together with some new ones, have been used by the King's School, Canterbury, for boarding houses and the school library. This part of the St Augustine's Abbey site was purchased by the school in 1994. In 1940 the ruins of the abbey were taken into the care of the British government and are now managed by English Heritage. The Abbey is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site with Canterbury Cathedral and St Martin's Church.

Private First Class Henry Gurke (November 6, 1922 – November 9, 1943) was a United States Marine who was killed in action in 1943 in the Bougainville Campaign of World War II.  For his heroic actions, he was posthumously received the Medal of Honor — the highest military honor bestowed by the United States.  Biography Henry Gurke was born in Neche, North Dakota on November 6, 1922, to immigrant parents, Julius Gurke (1884–1968), a German-speaking carpenter from Dubno, a city on the Ikva River in the Rivne Oblast (province) of western Ukraine and his wife, Hulda Fischer Gurke (1890–1970).  His parents had first immigrated to Canada from Ukraine and then to the United States from Winnipeg, Manitoba in July 1912. The fifth of eight children, he was baptized in the Lutheran Church, and attended the local schools around Neche, a small town in the northeast corner of North Dakota, one mile from the Canadian bordertown of Gretna, Manitoba.  After graduation from high school in 1940, he entered the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in July and was stationed in Larimore, North Dakota. He stayed in the CCC until October 1941 and rose to the position of Assistant Leader, then returned to Neche where he drove a two–ton truck until his enlistment in the United States Marine Corps on April 15, 1942. Private Gurke went through recruit training at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, then went into the 2d Separate Pack Howitzer Battalion of the 22nd Marines and was in C Battery only one month before shipping overseas on the SS Lurline on July 30, 1942 — three and a half months after his enlistment in the Marines. He landed at Apia, Upolu, British Samoa, one month later. Within two weeks the 3rd Battalion, 22nd Marines, with Pvt Gurke's battery attached, went to Uvea Island of the Wallis Islands to relieve the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, which left to rejoin the 1st Marine Division then engaged in the grueling fight for Guadalcanal. In September 1942, Pvt Gurke was transferred to Company D, 3rd Raider Battalion. After four months at Wallis, the Raiders left for Pago Pago, American Samoa, stayed there about three weeks, then moved south to Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides, landing there in January 1943. The following month the Raiders went over to Guadalcanal for a few days en route to the Russell Islands. Pavuvu Island in the Russells was occupied without opposition by Pvt Gurke's battalion from February 21, to March 18, 1943. The battalion returned to Espiritu Santo in March. On August 1, 1943, Gurke was promoted to private first class. Transferred to Company M, 3rd Raider Battalion, 2nd Raider Regiment of the I Marine Amphibious Corps in June, PFC Gurke was at Nouméa, New Caledonia, in October and finally met the enemy at Bougainville in November.  Private First Class Gurke was in a shallow two–man foxhole with a fellow Marine, a Browning Automatic Rifle–man (BAR–man), around dawn of November 9, 1943, delivering a fierce stream of fire against the advancing Japanese in defense of a vital road block in the area near Empress Augusta Bay. Judging from the increased ferocity of the enemy grenade attack, that the enemy was determined to annihilate him and his buddy because of the fierce effective fire they were rendering, PFC Gurke roughly thrust his companion aside when a Japanese grenade landed in their foxhole and threw himself on the deadly missile. For his unswerving devotion to duty and uncommon valor in the face of the enemy, President Franklin D. Roosevelt posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor to PFC Gurke. The medal was presented to his parents at ceremonies in the Navy Department on May 31, 1944. The Assistant Secretary of the Navy made the presentation in the name of the President. In 1945, PFC Gurke's mother, Mrs. Julius (Hulda) Gurke, sponsored the destroyer USS Gurke (DD-783) that was named in honor of her son. The body of PFC Gurke was originally buried at Bougainville, later moved to Munda, New Georgia, and then to Finschhafen, New Guinea, and was finally returned for burial in Neche Union Cemetery in Neche, North Dakota.  Medal of Honor citation The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR posthumously to  for service as set forth in the following CITATION:  For extraordinary heroism and courage above and beyond the call of duty while serving with the Third Marine Raider Battalion during action against the enemy Japanese Forces in the Solomon Islands area on November 9, 1943. While his platoon was engaged in the defense of a vital road block near Empress Augusta Bay on Bougainville Island, Private First Class Gurke, in company with another Marine, was delivering a fierce stream of fire against the main vanguard of the Japanese. Concluding from the increasing ferocity of grenade barrages that the enemy was determined to annihilate their shallow, two–man foxhole, he resorted to a bold and desperate measure for holding out despite the torrential hail of shells. When a Japanese grenade dropped squarely into the foxhole, Private First Class Gurke, mindful that his companion manned an automatic weapon of superior fire power and therefore could provide more effective resistance, thrust him roughly aside and flushing his own body over the missile to smother the explosion. With unswerving devotion to duty and superb valor, Private First Class Gurke sacrificed himself in order that his comrade might live to carry on the fight. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.  /S/ FRANKLIN D.

The 1992 NCAA Division I lacrosse tournament was the 22nd annual tournament hosted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to determine the team champion of men's college lacrosse among its Division I programs, held at the end of the 1992 NCAA Division I men's lacrosse season. Princeton completed a 13-2 season by defeating Syracuse in the championship game in two overtime, 10-9. The win marked the first NCAA tournament title for Princeton and seventh overall college lacrosse national championship. The championship game was played at Franklin Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with 13,150 fans in attendance.  Overview The Tigers upset top-ranked Syracuse who were playing in their fourth Division I final in the prior five years. Syracuse, which had come back from a six goal deficit, lost on Andy Moe's fourth goal of the game nine seconds into the second sudden-death overtime. Princeton's Greg Waller won the overtime faceoff, with Moe retrieving the ground ball and sprinting down the right side for the winning goal. A misplayed clear by Princeton's goalie allowed Tom Marechek to score a virtually empty net goal with 42 seconds left in regulation to tie it. Only five years before this championship, Princeton had just two wins with thirteen losses.

Dawsholm Park is a public park in Glasgow, Scotland, adjoining the Kelvindale, Maryhill and Temple areas of the city, and southern parts of the town of Bearsden. It is situated on the River Kelvin, north of the River Clyde. The park covers an area of 33 hectares (82 acres), and consists mostly of woodland, with some grass and wildflower meadows in the southeast area of the park. The park was created from lands purchased by Glasgow City Council from Sir Archibald Campbell of Succoth, in 1922. As well as the woodland area (originally called the Belvidere plantation), the Council also purchased some grassy areas to the south of the woodland. Sir Archibald then gifted an area of land contaminated with oil shale waste adjoining the eastern boundary of the woodland. The council levelled and grassed over that area to form a recreation area laid out with football pitches. The woodland area of the park has always been kept in a natural state, and in 2007 Glasgow City Council designated the park as a Local Nature Reserve. As part of the environmental and ecological work in the park, Highland Cattle are being used in a managed grazing programme on the grassy areas, to encourage the development of wildflower meadows. The peripheries of the park include the University of Glasgow School of Veterinary Medicine, the institution's sporting facilities (Garscube Complex), the West of Scotland Science Park, and one of the four main waste recycling facilities in the city, serving its north-west sector.

A quorum is the minimum number of votes that a distributed transaction has to obtain in order to be allowed to perform an operation in a distributed system. A quorum-based technique is implemented to enforce consistent operation in a distributed system.  Quorum-based techniques in distributed database systems Quorum-based voting can be used as a replica control method, as well as a commit method to ensure transaction atomicity in the presence of network partitioning.  Quorum-based voting in commit protocols In a distributed database system, a transaction could execute its operations at multiple sites. Since atomicity requires every distributed transaction to be atomic, the transaction must have the same fate (commit or abort) at every site. In case of network partitioning, sites are partitioned and the partitions may not be able to communicate with each other. This is where a quorum-based technique comes in. The fundamental idea is that a transaction is executed if the majority of sites vote to execute it. Every site in the system is assigned a vote Vi. Let us assume that the total number of votes in the system is V and the abort and commit quorums are Va and Vc, respectively. Then the following rules must be obeyed in the implementation of the commit protocol:  Va + Vc > V, where 0 < Vc, Va                         ≤                 {\displaystyle \leq }     V. Before a transaction commits, it must obtain a commit quorum Vc.The total of at least one site that is prepared to commit and zero or more sites waiting                         ≥                 {\displaystyle \geq }     Vc. Before a transaction aborts, it must obtain an abort quorum VaThe total of zero or more sites that are prepared to abort or any sites waiting                         ≥                 {\displaystyle \geq }     Va. The first rule ensures that a transaction cannot be committed and aborted at the same time. The next two rules indicate the votes that a transaction has to obtain before it can terminate one way or the other.  Quorum-based voting for replica control In replicated databases, a data object has copies present at several sites. To ensure serializability, no two transactions should be allowed to read or write a data item concurrently. In case of replicated databases, a quorum-based replica control protocol can be used to ensure that no two copies of a data item are read or written by two transactions concurrently. The quorum-based voting for replica control is due to [Gifford, 1979]. Each copy of a replicated data item is assigned a vote. Each operation then has to obtain a read quorum (Vr) or a write quorum (Vw) to read or write a data item, respectively. If a given data item has a total of V votes, the quorums have to obey the following rules:  Vr + Vw > V Vw > V/2 The first rule ensures that a data item is not read and written by two transactions concurrently. Additionally, it ensures that a read quorum contains at least one site with the newest version of the data item. The second rule ensures that two write operations from two transactions cannot occur concurrently on the same data item. The two rules ensure that one-copy serializability is maintained.

Light + Shade is the 23rd studio album by English musician Mike Oldfield. It was the first album to be released by Oldfield following his signing with Mercury Records. The album was released on 26 September 2005. Some of the music on these CDs was originally released, with alternate mixes, on the soundtracks to his virtual reality games, Tres Lunas and Maestro.  Background The album offers two genres of music for two different moods, a division which Oldfield created by making two CDs of music. The first nine tracks are dubbed "Light" and feature brighter and quiet pieces; the second half of the album is the "Shade" portion and brings in a much darker feel. Many of the tracks on the album are remixed and/or extended versions of the music from the Tres Lunas video game. On his official website, Oldfield reported that besides the standard version of the album, a 5.1 surround mix of the album had been produced as well. However, as of 2023 it has not been released. Four tracks from Light + Shade were made available in the U-MYX format for fans to mix themselves. Oldfield's attraction to vocal modification surfaced again, this time in the form of Vocaloid, a virtual vocal software package. The voice of "Miriam" was used. The virtual voice "Miriam" is based on the voice of Miriam Stockley, with whom Oldfield had previously worked. "Tears of an Angel" also featured Miriam singing alongside the Cantor software. The tracks "First Steps" and "Ringscape" were arranged by Robyn Smith. Christopher von Deylen makes a guest appearance on "Nightshade". Oldfield repaid the favour by playing guitar on "Morgentau", a track from the Tag und Nacht album for Deylen's band Schiller. "Quicksilver" is an alternative name for the metal mercury, which is also the name of his then-current record label. On Oldfield's following album, Music of the Spheres, he repeats this trick, with a track title "Musica Universalis" which when translated is Universal Music. The track "Blackbird" is named after one of Oldfield's motorbikes, a Honda CBR1100XX Blackbird. The track "Closer" is an instrumental reworking of the 19th century Christian hymn Nearer, My God, to Thee.  The same tune is utilized again for the bonus track "Prés de Toi". The track "Romance" is a Techno version of a fragment of the 19th century classical guitar piece by the same name. The bonus track "Lakme (Fruity Loops)" is a techno rendering of the song Flower Duet from the opera Lakme.  Track listing Light "Angelique" – 4:40 "Blackbird" – 4:39 "The Gate" – 4:14 "First Steps" – 10:02 "Closer" – 2:51 "Our Father" – 6:50 "Rocky" – 3:19 "Sunset" – 4:47 "Près de Toi" (Bonus track)  Shade "Quicksilver" – 5:55 "Resolution" – 4:33 "Slipstream" – 5:15 "Surfing" – 5:36 "Tears of an Angel" – 5:38 "Romance" – 4:00 "Ringscape" – 4:22 "Nightshade" – 5:11 "Lakme (Fruity Loops)" (Bonus track) "Cook's Tune" (Bonus track)  U-MYX CD-ROM tracks "Quicksilver" (U-MYX version) "Our Father" (U-MYX version) "Slipstream" (U-MYX version) "Angelique" (U-MYX version)  Equipment list Single One of the Vocaloid tracks, "Surfing", was meant to be the album's first single, according to the Spanish website zm.nu. A promo single was released on 3 September 2005.  Use in other media Pieces from Light and Shade have been used in media, such as the use of "Resolution" and "Slipstream" in the BBC's technology series Click.

Paulo de Mello Bastos (São José da Laje, May 25, 1918 — May 30, 2019) was a former leader of the National Union of Aeronauts, a former leader of the General Workers Command and a former Varig pilot whose resignation in 1963 inspired a general strike in the country.  Biography Childhood Paulo de Mello Bastos was born at the Engenho do Roçadinho, in São José da Laje, on May 25, 1918, son of Sebastião Marques de Mello Bastos, founder and former mayor of Panelas and Honorinha Portela Bastos.  Education Paulo de Mello Bastos studied at Americano Baptista (Recife), Diocesano College (Maceió), Alagoano Lyceum (Alagoas) and at Quinze de Novembro de Garanhuns (Pernambuco).  Career Air Force In 1938 he was among those enrolled in the Administration Course for Naval Air Reserve officers by decision of the Navy Minister. On April 6, 1940, Paulo de Mello received his naval aviator pilot's license, graduating as the first in his class. In the same year he tried to volunteer for the Royal Air Force to fight against Germany during WWII, but it was not possible because Brazil had not yet entered the war at that time. In 1941 he was promoted to the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. In 1942 he was a pilot for the National Air Mail, flying the Tocantins route between January 13 and 27 and between Rio-Natal between June 24 and June 26. In March of the same year he was transferred to the Aeronautics School. In April he had been assigned as an instructor at the School of Aeronautics. On 12 January 1943 he was promoted by to the rank of First Lieutenant. In this period, already during World War II, he participated in the creation of the Aeronautics Club, a place where officers would hold political discussions, leisure, and culture. He fought in Europe during World War II against Nazism, and was decorated for his service. In 1945 he was promoted to the rank of Air Captain due to his time in service. In 1946 he applied for discharge from military service to work in the civilian sector. However, his application was only filed in 1954. In the 1940s he was part of a committee that sought to inspire Getúlio Vargas to run for president in 1950 and to establish Petrobras, a company whose creation he had been defending for some years as a member of the nationalist side of the Armed Forces. In 1950 he was promoted to the rank of Major by "merit principle". In the same year he worked at the Directorate of Education of the Air Force. In December 1951 he received a bronze medal for more than ten years of active service. In February 1952 he had his name proposed as part of the re-election of the Military Club's board of directors. The following year he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonell and transferred to the paid reserve.  Civilian aviation In 1954 he joined Varig. The following year he petitioned the Supreme Federal Court for habeas corpus for former minister Epaminondas Gomes dos Santos, who was being charged with a crime of defamation, claiming that the crime was not military in nature, and was refused on May 6, 1955, for not being the correct person to make the request. On November 12 of the same year, when already secretary of the National Union of Aeronauts, he was one of the signers of the manifest in favor of a constitutional government after the November 11 counter-coup carried out by Marshal Teixeira Lott against the government of Carlos Luz. In December 1955 he even submitted his resignation from his position as President of the Pilots' Union, but was turned down for lack of the legal number present for consideration. In 1956 he was a member of the commission that held the commemorations of the fiftieth anniversary of Alberto Santos Dumont's flight in the 14-bis. In March 1957 he advocated, with the pilots' category, the reduction from 12 to 10 daily working hours, as a way to avoid fatigue. In May of the same year he was one of the union leaders that addressed a letter to the Ministry of Aeronautics in defense of airline safety, after thirteen accidents occurred in a 20-day period. On May 31 he was elected president of the governing board of the National Union of Aeronauts, which was in power until the election of the board. At the same meeting it was decided to merge the National Union of Air Transport Pilots with the National Union of Aeronauts. In 1959, already a Varig airline captain, Paulo de Mello Bastos defended the creation of Aerobrás. In July 1961 he was one of the union leaders who greeted cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on his visit to Brazil. In the same year he was the pilot responsible for bringing the then Vice-president João Goulart to Brazil within the context of the Legality Campaign, which led him to take on a risky, low-altitude style of flying during the journey due to rumors that members of the Brazilian Air Force would shoot him down in accordance with Operation Mosquito. In the same period he chaired a delegation of trade unionists that visited the Soviet Union. In 1962 he was one of the leaders of the General Workers Command and politically supported the Base Reforms, but he was not a communist. In November of the same year he represented the pilot class in an inquiry into the crash of a VASP airplane, which collided with a tourist plane, resulting in 26 deaths. During his time at Varig, he also turned down several promotion proposals, which were aimed, according to Bastos, at controlling his union activities.  Mello Bastos strike On May 21 he was chosen as vice-president of the CGT and in the next day he was elected as secretary of the General Workers Command. On the 25th, despite having union immunity, he was illegally fired from Varig, something that worried then president João Goulart, who tried to intercede on behalf of Paulo de Mello, and the fact that he was not reinstated, started a general strike with road workers, airline workers, oil tankers, among others, which became known as the "Mello Bastos strike", an act that the newspaper "Novos Rumos" considered unprecedented within the union movement in Brazil until then and which was reported internationally, such as in the Colombian newspaper "El Tiempo" and in the Costa Rican La Nación. In a note, Varig reported that the dismissal would have occurred due to the captain's "serious fault", which would justify the end of the contract and later declared that only the Judiciary could decide on the case. Commander Paulo de Mello had denounced on May 12, 1963, as part of the TV Tupi program "Sem Retoque", the financial misuse in commercial aviation, criticized the results of the CPI on air accidents and blamed Varig for the air accidents that happened at the time. He was finally rehired by Varig, after the president's appeal, on June 7, but had his salary suspended and the right to fly until the decision of the Labor Court. His reinstatement was considered by the Unity and Action Pact, according to the Diário Carioca, to represent "the guarantee of the rights of all union leadership in the country." With the reinstatement, Varig's president, Ruben Berta, stepped down from his position. In July 1963 he received Cr$ 437,127 in unpaid wages, but refused the proposal to terminate his contract with the company and receive compensation of approximately Cr$ 7 million, which he considered offensive to him. He was barred by the company from resuming his position as an Aircraft Commander. In June, during the events of the strike, Paulo de Mello was one of the signers of the manifesto delivered to João Goulart in which they defended, among other demands, the "firm disposition of the workers to fight alongside the president of the Republic, if necessary, in the case of a break with the International Monetary Fund".  Post-Strike In August 1963 he took part in demonstrations to pressure the government to create Aerobrás. In September he was one of the articulators after the sergeants' revolt and in October he was one of the union leaders who sought to defend João Goulart's mandate after the call for a state of siege.  In January 1964 Paulo de Mello Bastos spoke to the Diário de Pernambuco about what he expected from the eventual presidential elections, with the possibility of the Brazilian left running with Miguel Arraes or Leonel Brizola. However, with the indirect elections of 1964, the 1965 elections were cancelled. In February an indictment was filed under the National Security Law that involved his name alongside other leaders for having launched a manifesto preceding the October 15, 1962 general strike. In the same period he was involved in the organization of a support coalition so that the government would be able to approve the base reforms. On March 27, 1964, he was one of the leaders involved in resolving the Sailors' revolt.  1964 coup d'état In the events of March 31, 1964, Paulo de Mello Bastos managed to escape from prison when troops invaded the building where he was meeting with a group of union members. In the course of the 1964 Brazilian coup d'état, he had his political rights suspended by AI-1 until the Amnesty Law in August 28, 1979; lost his aviator's license; although he held a union leadership position at the time, he was fired from Varig; fired from Brazilian Air Force on September 24, 1964; and came to seek political asylum at the Uruguayan Embassy on April 12, 1964. However, he only managed to leave the country on June 19 in a Uruguayan Air Force plane, going to Montevideo, after receiving his safe conduct to leave the country. Officially he was declared dead and his wife received a widow's pension. In Uruguay he tried to get a job at PLUNA, but was barred due to pressure from the Brazilian government against political exiles and in the country also worked in the wine trade. In 1965 he was one of the 83 people who had to return the Santos-Dumont Merit Medal by order of President Castelo Branco and in the same year was the target of an investigation that pointed him out as a member of a "counter-revolution" articulated by Leonel Brizola. Paulo de Mello only received the safe conduct from Itamaraty in 1966 and returned to the country in October 1967. In the same month that he returned to the country, he was arrested by DOPS for questioning, and released soon after. In 1968 he started working for the newspaper "Correio da Manhã", which had become part of the opposition to the military dictatorship. During the 1970s he worked on international denunciations against the crimes of the military dictatorship, sending documents abroad, and was also one of the articulators of the Amnesty law. Rede Brasil Atual described that Paulo de Mello never accepted the dictatorship implanted in 1964. By dictatorship decree, he could not return to being a pilot and worked as a taxi-driver in Rio de Janeiro. Was amnestied by the Air Force in February 1980 and in 1981 tried to return to his job at Varig through the Amnesty Law. But in practice, Amnesty had only returned his political rights. Before the end of the dictatorship he was one of the organizers of the Centro Brasil Democrático, linked to the PCB.  Return to the democratic period From 1991 on, he had a hard time to get his amnesty retirement, which was only solved after an injunction from the Federal Court. In this period, during the government of Leonel Brizola in Rio de Janeiro, he accepted to be the director of the State Foundation for Education of the Minor, at the Santos Dumont School, where he tried to remove the repressive methods and give education to orphaned, street or delinquent girls. In 1998 he began his writing career, with his first book, "Salvo Conduto" (Safe Conduct), published by Garamond, describing his career as a union leader and on the same occasion received the "Destaque Aeronauta" award, from the National Union of Aeronauts. In August 1999 he released the book "Nos Bastidores da Anistia" (Behind the Scenes of Amnesty). On October 23, 2003, he was restored the Santos-Dumont Merit Medal. In March 2006 Paulo de Mello testified at the Amnesty Commission and in September of the same year published the book "A Caixa-Preta do Golpe de 64" (The Black-Box from the 1964 Coup d'état). In July 2011 he was involved in honoring the centennial of Brigadier Francisco Teixeira, who in 1948 launched The oil is ours only campaign. In 2014 he was one of the CGT representatives still alive who signed a document sent to the Ministry of Labor that requested a survey of interventions in trade union centrals between 1946 and 1988. In 2018 he was honored by the Torture Never Again Group, receiving the Chico Mendes Medal of Resistance.  Death Paulo de Mello Bastos died on May 30, 2019, and was cremated at Carmo Memorial.  Personal life He married teacher Edelena Albernaz de Mello Bastos on January 23, 1943. He fathered João W. Nery, Solange Bastos, Flávia Cavalcanti and Tania de Mello Bastos. He was a cousin-brother of Luiz Portela de Carvalho, mayor of Palmares. In his career as an aviator he has accumulated more than 16,000 flight hours.

Moving Sidewalks were an American rock band formed in 1966 from Houston, Texas. They released several singles and an album, before bassist Don Summers and keyboardist Tom Moore were drafted into the army, bringing the band to an end. Guitarist Billy Gibbons and drummer Dan Mitchell then formed band ZZ Top.  History Gibbons founded Moving Sidewalks in the mid-1960s and they quickly drew a large following, especially among the Houston "teen scene".  They recorded several singles and one full-length album, Flash. Their single "99th Floor" was well received, and topped the charts at No. 1 in Houston for six weeks. The success of this record led them to sign with Wand Records, which then released "Need Me", also a Top 10 hit for the band. The group was asked to open for many rock tours, including Jimi Hendrix and the Doors. After Tom Moore and Don Summers were drafted into the United States Army, Gibbons and Mitchell added Lanier Greig and formed the original ZZ Top. While attending Warner Brothers' art school in Hollywood, California, Gibbons engaged with his first bands including the Saints, Billy G & the Blueflames, and the Coachmen. By 1967, Gibbons returned to Houston and formed an artfully designed band, conceptually inspired by friend and fellow musician Roky Erickson and the 13th Floor Elevators. 'The Moving Sidewalks' name was chosen, and shortly thereafter they recorded "99th Floor". Around this time Gibbons developed a camaraderie with Jimi Hendrix.  As a guest on The Dick Cavett Show, Hendrix deflected the implication that he was the greatest guitarist. He did not say who the greatest guitarist was, but a myth has circulated that Hendrix considered Gibbons the best, and stated so in an interview, but no such interview has ever been located. The Moving Sidewalks continued to appear along with the 13th Floor Elevators at the short-lived yet Houston psychedelic venue, Love Street Light Circus, at Allen's Landing. One night, the Elevators set was cut short by Houston Police, who arrested the band's lead singer Erickson for marijuana possession. In January 2013, Gibbons announced the Moving Sidewalks would reunite with all original members for one show on March 30, 2013, at B.B. King's Blues Club in New York City.  Since that successful sold out show and despite their single show announcement, the band played as official headliners of Austin Psych Fest on May 1, 2013, and the Charity Gala for The Deacons of Deadwood Ball on September 28, 2013, in Houston.

John Drakard (1775?–1854) was an English newspaper proprietor, publisher, and political radical, imprisoned for his journalism.  Life He went into business at Stamford, Lincolnshire as a printer and book-seller at the beginning of the 19th century. On 15 September 1809 he started a weekly paper, the Stamford News. The first editor was the topographer Thomas Blore, but he and Drakard soon fell out. On 13 March 1811 Drakard was tried at Lincoln before Baron George Wood and a special jury on an ex officio information for libel, and was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment in Lincoln Castle, and fined £200. The subject matter of the libel was an article published in Drakard's paper for 24 August 1810, entitled "One Thousand Lashes", which dealt with the question of corporal punishment in the British Army. Drakard was defended by Henry Brougham, but was convicted, even though the Hunts, proprietors of The Examiner, had been previously acquitted on the charge of libel for publishing most of the same article. Drakard was a defendant in other libel suits. He was horsewhipped by Robert Brudenell, 6th Earl of Cardigan for some remarks in the Stamford News. Cardigan tracked him to Northampton, and gave him a public whipping on the racecourse. Drakard was also the proprietor of the Stamford Champion, a weekly newspaper which first appeared on 5 January 1830, under the name of the Champion of the East. The poet John Clare wrote anonymous political satire in it. In 1834 the publication of both his newspapers ceased, and Drakard retired to Ripley, North Yorkshire, where he lived on a meagre income. He died at Ripon on 25 January 1854, aged 79.  Works The authorship of the two following works (both of which were published by him) has been attributed to Drakard, but it has also been doubted whether he had any part in their writing:  Drakard's Edition of the Public and Private Life of Colonel Wardle. … Introduced by an original Essay on Reform, &c., Stamford [1810?]. On Gwyllym Lloyd Wardle. The History of Stamford, in the County of Lincoln, comprising its ancient, progressive, and modern state; with an Account of St. Martin's, Stamford Baron, and Great and Little Wothorpe, Northamptonshire, Stamford, 1822. Octavius Graham Gilchrist is thought to have supplied much of the content.

Gina Villalobos is an American singer-songwriter and composer. From 1992 thorough 2013, she extensively toured and recorded in the United States, the UK and Europe, writing songs and making music in bands and as a solo artist. Counting her most recent release, Sola (2014), Villalobos has released five solo studio albums. She continues to sing and compose in her work as a music creator at Feverpitch, where she services the motion picture industry, specifically those companies making movie trailer music. She creates sound effects, produces music, and composes original scores.  Early life Villalobos spent her childhood in the Santa Monica Mountain community of Lake Sherwood, California. By way of inspiration, Gina's mother handed down her passion for music, while her father Reynaldo Villalobos is an acclaimed cinematographer and director. By the time she was seven, Villalobos was teaching herself guitar, and began her music career at the end of college.  Musical career In her early 20s, Villalobos fronted and played guitar in the acoustic folk trio Liquid Sunshine. Together, they recorded the albums Sweet Commitment and Barbary Lane, as well as the self-titled Liquid Sunshine EP before disbanding in 1996. Between 1997 and 2001, Villalobos fronted the band The Mades, with whom she recorded two albums, before starting her solo career with 2002's Beg From Me. In 2004, she caught the attention of respected U.S. publications like Paste, No Depression, Acoustic Guitar, and Harp. In anticipation of her sophomore studio album, Live from KXLU Radio was released, containing a live recording with songs off the new album. With her second outing, Rock 'N' Roll Pony, the European press and radio praised the CD, which reached No. 3 on the Euro-Americana charts, and by 2005, Villalobos was performing in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. She toured with Laura Veirs in 2005 on her UK tour.  Her 2007 self-release Miles Away repeated her previous successes in the U.K. press and on BBC Radio 2. Around that time, the alternative rock band World Party invited Villalobos to tour the States with them, and her songs started showing up in movies and TV shows like One Tree Hill and Army Wives. Two years later, Gina delivered Days on Their Side. Villalobos has been associated with Anne McCue, and has been recognized for her contribution to California songs. In 2014, after an extended hiatus and having taken the time to produce the album since January 2012, Sola was released. She produced and Erik Colvin engineered, as he's done for each of her previous three offerings. Augmenting Gina's vocals and guitar are guitarist Kevin Haaland (Andy Grammer), back for his fourth Gina Villalobos album, and returning guitarist Josh Grange (Sheryl Crow, k.d. lang, Beck, Dixie Chicks); Also credited are Eric Heywood (Son Volt, Ray LaMontagne, The Pretenders, Alejandro Escovedo) on pedal steel. Upright bass was performed by Ian Walker (k.d. lang, Cher, Paula Cole, The Ditty Bops). Quinn (Tracy Chapman, Daft Punk, Paula Cole) was the drummer. In late 2015, The Golden Globe Award and Emmy Award-winning Amazon Studios TV show, Transparent selected the arrangement featuring the  Gina Villalobos/Eric Colvin produced version of the 1971 Sly and the Family Stone hit "Family Affair" featuring the vocals of Ruby Friedman for use in the trailer promoting the launch of Season 2.

"Days of Future Past" is a storyline in the Marvel Comics comic book The Uncanny X-Men issues #141–142, published in 1981. It deals with a dystopian future in which mutants are incarcerated in internment camps. An adult Kate Pryde transfers her mind into her younger self, the present-day Kitty Pryde, who brings the X-Men to prevent a fatal moment in history that triggers anti-mutant hysteria. The storyline was produced during the franchise's rise to popularity under the writer/artist team of Chris Claremont, John Byrne and Terry Austin. The dark future seen in the story has been revisited numerous times, and was the basis for the 2014 similarly titled feature film X-Men: Days of Future Past, wherein Wolverine is sent back in time. In 2001, fans voted the first issue of this storyline as the 25th greatest Marvel comic. The Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005 gave the numerical designation for the original "Days of Future Past" timeline as Earth-811 in the Marvel Multiverse.  Plot The storyline alternates between the present year of 1980 and the future year of 2013. In the future, Sentinels rule a dystopian United States, and mutants are hunted and placed in internment camps. Having conquered North America and hunted all mutants and other superhumans, the Sentinels are turning their attention to the rest of the world. On the eve of a feared nuclear holocaust, the few remaining X-Men, while making a desperate attempt to stop the Sentinels, send Kitty Pryde's mind backward through time, to possess the body of her younger-self and to prevent a pivotal event in mutant–human history and the cause of these events: the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly along with Charles Xavier and Moira MacTaggert by Mystique's newly reassembled Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Working with the present-day X-Men, Kitty Pryde's future-self succeeds in her mission and is pulled back to her own time, while her present-day-self is returned with no memory of any interim. The world of 2013 is not shown again in this story arc; the present-day X-Men are left to ponder whether their future dystopia has been averted or simply delayed.  Background and creation John Byrne devised the plot for "Days of Future Past", since he wanted to do a story featuring the Sentinels and his collaborator Chris Claremont had no interest in coming up with one. Years later, Byrne said, he realized that he had unconsciously lifted the "spine" of the plot from the 1972 Doctor Who serial Day of the Daleks.  Sequels Though Byrne had intended "Days of Future Past" to be a completely self-contained story, with the future world seen in the story no longer existing even as an alternate timeline following the conclusion, a number of stories have revisited this future and even acted as outright sequels. Rachel Summers, a character seen in the future segments of "Days of Future Past", later travels through time to the present day and joins the X-Men. A supervillain, Ahab, follows her to the present in the "Days of Future Present" crossover. In this story, Ahab kidnaps the children Franklin Richards (son of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman and, in the future timeline, Rachel's lover) and Nathan Summers (son of Cyclops and Madelyne Pryor) but is defeated by the X-Men, X-Factor, the New Mutants and the Fantastic Four. Rachel joins the European mutant team Excalibur, whose series twice revisited the "Days of Future Past" timeline. The first time was in a story by Alan Davis entitled "Days of Future Yet To Come", in which a time-traveling Excalibur and several Marvel UK heroes overthrow the Sentinel rulers of future America. This storyline also reveals that Excalibur's robotic "mascot" Widget had been possessed by the spirit of the future Kitty Pryde. A similar but distinct reality is seen in a vision by her teammate Captain Britain. This story, "Days of Future Tense", reveals the final fate of that timeline's Excalibur team. A prelude to "Days of Future Past" was produced in a three-part mini-series entitled "Wolverine: Days of Future Past". This three-issue mini dealt with ramifications between the catalyst for the creation of the alternative future up until the main storyline in Uncanny X-Men 141–142. The prelude explains why Logan leaves for Canada and why Magneto is in a wheelchair in the main two issue story. Another view of this reality was presented in the second issue of Hulk: Broken Worlds. A short story, "Out of Time", examines the life of Bruce Banner (the Hulk) in a Sentinel prison camp. The miniseries Days of Future Past: Doomsday looks at what happened to other characters as this world fell apart, such as Spider-Man being beaten to death in an anti-mutant riot or General Ross and the Avengers resigning from the government in protest  at what they were being asked to do.  Secret Wars (2015) A sequel based on the original storyline written by Marguerite Bennett, Years of Future Past, was released in June 2015, featuring the "Days of Future Past" timeline depicted in the 2015 "Secret Wars" storyline. The setting on Battleworld is called the Sentinel Territories. Major characters in the series include Christina Pryde and Cameron, the children of Kate Pryde and Colossus.  In other media Television The "Days of Future Past" storyline was adapted in the X-Men animated series. The storyline concepts were combined with another alternative future story—that of Bishop and the idea of a traitor within the ranks of the X-Men, though Mystique is still responsible for Senator Kelly's assassination. Bishop plays the role of Kitty Pryde in the adaptation—albeit traveling completely back in time instead of just projecting his mind into his past self—while the 'traitor' is 'revealed' to be Gambit, with the X-Men's interference revealing that Mystique had killed Senator Kelly while in Gambit's appearance to try and frame the X-Men. The series Wolverine and the X-Men has a similar storyline, in which Professor X is in a coma for 20 years, and awakens to find that the mutants are imprisoned by the Sentinels. He telepathically connects with the X-Men of the past to try to prevent that future from happening. By the end of the first season, the Sentinel-dominated future was averted. However, a future based on "Age of Apocalypse" appeared in its place. The series stopped production before the second season revolving around this could be made. A Days of Future Past incarnation appeared in The Super Hero Squad Show episode "Days, Nights, and Weekends of Future Past". A Madland level based on "Days of Future Past" appears in the Ultimate Spider-Man episode "Game Over". Mutant Arcade designs the level under the basis of Sentinels being used to destroy mutants. The scenario features a shot of Wolverine being blasted by a Sentinel in an homage to the cover of Uncanny X-Men No. 142. Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. features a five-part episode entitled Days of Future Smash, which consists of the Hulk chasing the Leader throughout numerous events of time and space. The episode's title is a reference to Days of Future Past. A future resembling that in Days of Future Past can be briefly glimpsed in the Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur episode "Skip This Ad...olescence", as Moon Girl is accidentally sent to her future body by her time traveling app. The scene itself homages the cover of Uncanny X-Men #141. Executive producer Steve Loter later hinted on his Twitter account that the scene foreshadowed elements from the series' planned storyline.  Film X-Men: Days of Future Past is a sequel to First Class. Numerous actors from the franchise returned, including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Anna Paquin, Elliot Page, Shawn Ashmore, Daniel Cudmore, Nicholas Hoult, Jennifer Lawrence, and Lucas Till. Newcomers Peter Dinklage, Omar Sy, Adan Canto, Fan Bingbing, Booboo Stewart and Evan Peters were also signed to play Bolivar Trask, Bishop, Sunspot, Blink, Warpath and Quicksilver, respectively. Although Wolverine is the one who is actually sent backward in time to his "younger" body, director Bryan Singer described Pryde as the prime facilitator and it is Pryde's phasing ability that enables time travel to happen. In this film, the catalyst for the Sentinel-dominated future was Mystique's assassination of Bolivar Trask and her subsequent capture, with analysis of her DNA allowing humanity to devise Sentinels capable of adapting to any mutant power. After Shadowcat learns how to use her abilities to 'phase' someone into their past self, Xavier and Magneto decide to have her send someone back in time to the year 1973 to prevent Mystique from killing Trask, with Wolverine being selected as he is the only one who can survive the process due to his regenerative healing factor. Upon arriving in 1973, Wolverine locates the past versions of Xavier, Hank McCoy, and Magneto and convinces them to help him prevent their extinction. Although Magneto nearly jeopardizes the plan when he tries to kill Mystique and takes control of the Sentinels as part of his own plan to save the mutant race, Xavier is able to convince Mystique to spare Trask, resulting in her being publicly shown defending President Richard Nixon from Magneto. As a result, Mystique is hailed as a hero, the Sentinel program is scrapped, and Trask is arrested for selling his designs to foreign nations. The film ends with Wolverine waking up in a revised, idyllic future in which the war with the Sentinels never happened and all of the X-Men are still alive.  Video games Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 has a "Days of Future Past"-inspired stage serving as an alternative to the standard Metro City stage, with an "Apprehended"/"Slain" poster similar to the famous one, featuring characters from both Marvel and Capcom that starred in Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, but did not return for the Marvel vs. Capcom 3 games.  Taking the place of the playable Wolverine is Mega Man. To coincide with the release of the film, GlitchSoft, a mobile app developer, released The Uncanny X-Men: Days of Future Past for iOS and Android devices. The game is a side-scrolling 2-D action adventure, with a storyline closer to the original comic book, than the one portrayed in the film. Initially players will be able to control Wolverine, and as they advance further in the game, they will be able to choose between Kitty Pryde, Colossus, Scarlet Witch and Cyclops, with Storm, Polaris and Magneto announced as additional characters, each one with different powers and abilities, which is upgradable as the player progress in the game, by obtaining experience points. The ending of the X-Men Origins: Wolverine video game is set in a not so distant future in which Wolverine (in an X-Men costume) breaks free from captivity by Bolivar Trask to discover Sentinels have taken over the world.  Novel A novelization of the comic version of "Days of Future Past" by Alex Irvine was released in May 2014 by Marvel Comics that tied into the release of the film, X-Men: Days of Future Past. It essentially follows the plot of the original comic storyline, but with two particular changes to the events set in the future: Magneto survives the escape of the Sentinel camp and hides until his powers are restored to the point that he can annihilate the remaining Sentinels, and Kitty is conscious in the body of her future self rather than remaining comatose until she is returned to her own time.  In popular culture In "Genesis", the first episode of the television series Heroes, the character of Hiro Nakamura cites Kitty's traveling through time as teaching him about the concepts of time travel. Hiro states that the comic taught him that time is a circle, even though it actually insinuated that time branched. The episode "Five Years Gone" was a further homage to the story, featuring Hiro and his friend Ando travelling into a future where New York has been destroyed and people with abilities are being hunted, forcing them to travel back into the past to prevent the original explosion.

Reedy Lake, historically also known as Lake Reedy, is a shallow 5.5-square-kilometre (2.1 sq mi) intermittent freshwater lake or swamp on the lower reaches of the Barwon River, on the Bellarine Peninsula southeast of Geelong in the Australian state of Victoria.  Location and features The lake is included in the Lake Connewarre State Game Reserve, managed by Parks Victoria and is the largest freshwater swamp in central Victoria, and is part of a wetland complex which includes Hospital Swamp, Lake Connewarre, Salt Swamp and the Barwon estuary. The lake's outlet to the tidal lower Barwon River is controlled by a weir. The lake is listed under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international significance, as part of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar Site.  History Six thousand years ago Reedy Lake was part of a large marine bay.  With a subsequent change in relative sea level it was cut off from the sea by a barrier of sand dunes, and its bed covered by a layer of alluvial clay deposited by the Barwon River.  Before European settlement of the area in the early 19th century the lake was an ephemeral wetland that became saline in summer from the seepage of salty ground-water and occasional exceptionally high tides.  In winter it usually became fresh, as river floods flushed out the saline water. The first barrier across the Barwon was built in 1838 to provide fresh water for Geelong.  In 1899 a second barrier, known as the 'lower breakwater' was built further downstream on the river at the southern boundary of Reedy Lake, making it a predominantly freshwater wetland, with an extensive cover of vegetation, that supported diverse populations of waterbirds and other aquatic wildlife.  By the 1930s its natural values were becoming appreciated and, in 1935, it was temporarily reserved for "public purposes".  Later it was protected permanently and its level of protection upgraded to that of game reserve.  During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s further works were carried out and refinements added, such as inlet pipes from the river above the lower breakwater and an outlet channel with a flow regulator, to maintain and control water levels in the lake. In the early 1990s the lake began to suffer degradation as the more permanent and deeper water levels allowed a large population of the introduced common carp to build up.  The feeding behaviour of the carp undermined the reedbeds and increased water turbidity, leading to the death of submerged plants, decreased oxygen levels and the decline of small aquatic wildlife.  This was remedied in 1996-1997 by drying out the lake to kill the carp before allowing it to fill again.  Since then water levels have been closely managed, with some seasonal drying in summer, to limit carp numbers and to maintain areas of open water as waterbird habitat.  Flora and fauna The lake is floristically rich and includes some 50 native freshwater aquatic vascular plants.  There are freshwater, subsaline and saline plant communities, with zones of saltmarsh and sedgeland around the perimeter of the lake shifting in response to changing water levels.  Other plant communities are Muehlenbeckia shrubland, samphire herbland and Phragmites australis  reedswamp.  There are areas of open water round the edge of the lake and as channels and lagoons in the reedbeds, as well as a central area in the deepest part of the lake known as the "Big Hole". A wide variety of waterbird species use the lake, many of them breeding there, sometimes in large numbers.  In spring straw-necked ibis, Australian white ibis and royal spoonbills form large breeding colonies, sometimes of up to 10,000-20,000 birds.  Other waterbirds with recorded counts of over 1000 at some time include the Australian shelduck, Pacific black duck, Australasian shoveler, grey and chestnut teal, purple swamphen, Eurasian coot, red-necked stint, sharp-tailed sandpiper, silver gull and whiskered tern.  Other species of which the lake is recorded as holding regionally high numbers are magpie geese, glossy ibis, brolga, Australian spotted crake, black-tailed godwit, marsh sandpiper, black-winged stilt, red-kneed dotterel and white-winged black tern.  The lake is a stronghold of the endangered Australasian bittern.  The lake and its associated wetlands are part of the Bellarine Wetlands Important Bird Area.

Jazz artists from Missouri include Dixieland jazz and ragtime clarinetist, composer, and bandleader Wilbur Sweatman; trumpeter, saxophonist, accordionist, and bandleader Charlie Creath; ragtime musician and composer Scott Joplin; bebop saxophonist and composer Charlie Parker; tenor saxophonists Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster, and Jimmy Forrest; pianist and bandleader Bennie Moten; trumpeters Shorty Baker, Clark Terry, Lester Bowie, Louis Metcalf, and Baikida Carroll; violinist Eddie South; alto saxophonist, arranger, and composer Lennie Niehaus; saxophonist, clarinetist, arranger, composer, and bandleader Oliver Nelson; clarinetist Pee Wee Russell; double bassist Wendell Marshall; trombonists Joseph Bowie and Melba Liston; alto saxophonists Luther Thomas and Jimmy Woods; saxophonist and composer Ahmad Alaadeen; guitarists Grant Green, Pat Metheny, and Norman Brown; drummer Phillip Wilson; organists Wild Bill Davis, Milt Buckner, and Charles Kynard; smooth jazz musicians Bob James and David Sanborn; and singers Anita O'Day and Oleta Adams. St. Louis's Gaslight Square entertainment district was an important area for jazz from the mid-1950s to 1960s. Jazz club Peacock Alley was the site of Miles Davis's recording of Miles Davis Quintet at Peacock Alley in 1956. The Black Artists' Group was a multidisciplinary art collective in St. Louis from 1968 to 1972 that fostered jazz and the Black Arts Movement in the city. BAG inspired the foundation of Human Arts Ensemble. By the 1920s, Kansas City was the geographical center of the vaudevillian Orpheum circuit, which included live music. Kansas City jazz is a riff-based and blues-influenced sound developed in jam sessions in the crowded clubs of the 18th and Vine neighborhood. Many jazz musicians of the 1930s and 1940s lived or got started here, including Charlie Parker, Count Basie, and Lester Young. Kansas City jazz in the 1930s marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. The 1979 documentary The Last of the Blue Devils portrays this era in interviews and performances by local jazz figures. Kansas City Jazz Orchestra is big band style. Due to this musical legacy, U.S. Representative Emanuel Cleaver said 18th and Vine is America's third most recognized street after Broadway and Hollywood Boulevard. In 2018, UNESCO designated Kansas City its first and only City of Music in the US, in "recognition of [Kansas City's] investment and commitment to music, arts, and creativity as a driver of urban economic development", including the city's $7 million budget for improving the 18th and Vine Jazz District in 2016.  Rock and metal The Urge came from St. Louis. Christofer Drew and his indie rock band Never Shout Never are from Joplin. Harlow from Kansas City signed to Greenworld records. Shaman's Harvest is from Jefferson City. Prog metal band Anacrusis is from St. Louis. In 2005, rock band Living Things gained national attention after the release of their album Ahead of the Lions. Cavo is from St. Louis. Puddle of Mudd is from Kansas City. Story Of The Year from St. Louis is multi-platinum. Greek Fire (band) Spawning from Story Of The Year also from St. Louis.  Hip-hop Tech N9ne from Kansas City helped popularize the chopper rap style in the late 1990s and co-founded the Strange Music label. Nelly from St. Louis had four #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits in the early 2000s, including "Hot in Herre" in 2002, and one with Murphy Lee. Metro Boomin from St. Louis has multiple #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits due to his production.  Country Branson, Missouri is a popular tourist destination in the Ozarks of southwestern Missouri with an association with mainstream country music. The town's popularity grew in the 1980s when a number of prominent country stars moved to the area, including Boxcar Willie, Sons of the Pioneers, and Roy Clark. Two major attractions had roots in the 1950s: the Shepherd of the Hills Theatre and Park, and Silver Dollar City. Modern music festivals in Branson include the Old-Time Fiddle Festival, Branson Jam, and the State of the Ozarks Fiddlers Convention. The largest music venue in Branson is the Grand Palace, which seats upwards of 4,000 people. Prominent local attractions in Branson include entrepreneur and performer Jennifer Wilson, a regional celebrity known for her show at the Americana Theatre, the Mabe family's Baldknobbers jamboree, which has been running for three generations, and Jim Owen of the Jim Owen Morning Show. The area's country music broadcasting history, however, can be traced to nearby Springfield, Missouri in the mid-1930s, when Ralph D. Foster's KWTO began carrying live performances and syndicating them to other stations across the country. The station's most famous program was Ozark Jubilee, which, starting in 1955, was carried live on ABC-TV across the country. Foster became a major figure in the region's music history; there is a museum named after him on the campus of the College of the Ozarks. Other national country music TV programs originating from Springfield included Five Star Jubilee and Talent Varieties. Television entertainers Porter Wagoner and Speck Rhodes were from West Plains, Missouri. Branson's place as a tourist destination was sparked in large part by the publication of the popular novel The Shepherd of the Hills by Harold Bell Wright in 1907, which is set in the Branson area. It was the first novel in America to sell over a million copies, and readers flocked to Branson to see the places described in the book. The local music scene and a tourism industry developed as a result.  Alt-country and indie rock Mid-1980s In the mid-1980s, the Saint Louis area (and nearby southern Illinois) was home to garage rock band the Primitives and rock band the Blue Moons. The Blue Moons featured Festus native Mark Ortmann on drums and Brian Henneman.  1990s The Primitives reorganized and transformed into Uncle Tupelo in the early 1990s. At the same time, Chicken Truck, an original outlaw country rock band, featuring Brian Henneman and drummer Mark Ortmann, was giving memorable performances in clubs such as Cicero's. Chicken Truck reorganized and became the indie roots rock band the Bottle Rockets in 1992. A country cover band called Coffee Creek linked all of these upstart bands. Coffee Creek was composed of Jay Farrar, Brian Henneman, Mike Heidorn, and Jeff Tweedy. Uncle Tupelo disbanded in 1994. Founding members of Uncle Tupelo formed Son Volt and Wilco after the split. Bottle Rockets became known for their hit songs, "Radar Gun", "$1,000 Car", and "I'll Be Comin' Around". Their success led to appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien performing one of their original songs and being featured in a comedic sketch.  2000s After extensive remodeling, Cicero's, in the art district of University City, became what is currently known as Blueberry Hill's Duck Room. Chuck Berry performed there frequently until 2014, and the venue hosts national touring rock music artists. Angel Olsen is a folk and indie rock singer, songwriter, and guitarist who was raised in St. Louis. Nathaniel Rateliff was born in St. Louis and grew up in Hermann before initially relocating to Colorado to work with an evangelical ministry, after which he left religion and began pursuing music professionally.

Wolkenstein is a town in the district Erzgebirgskreis, in Saxony, Germany. It is situated in the Ore Mountains, on the river Zschopau, 22 km southeast of Chemnitz. The town is situated on a rocky spur near the confluence of  the Zschopau and Preßnitz rivers. Its name is derived from the eponymous castle which is situated ca. 70 m above the river, and whose name signifies a rock that rises into the clouds. Aside from the town itself, Wolkenstein consists of the following subdivisions:  Warmbad is a spa town known for its hot spring with a variety of medicinal uses.  History A Herrschaft Wolkenstein is mentioned in 1262. The town itself was first mentioned in 1293, and was originally called an "oppidum" in 1323. A school was first recorded in 1385. From 1378, Wolkenstein was the seat of the noble family of Waldenburg. After they died out in 1473, it reverted to the House of Wettin. At the same time, mining started again in the area. The Protestant Reformation was introduced in 1536/1537, and Wolkenstein became an independent parish of its own. A wooden covered bridge across the Zschopau river was built in 1573. Witch-hunts occurred between 1614 and 1680. 67 mines were in operation around 1622. A great fire occurred in 1687, necessitating the rebuilding of the church which was consecrated again in 1689. The wooden bridge was replaced in 1769 by a stone bridge according to plans by Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann. A spinning mill was built in 1835 in Floßplatz, which was transformed into a paper mill in 1880. The Zschopay valley railway reached Wolkenstein in 1866. The local volunteer fire department was established in 1876. A new school was built in 1885. The sanitary sewers were completed in 1890, and a high pressure water supply in 1908. The narrow-gauge Pressnitz valley railway opened in 1892. Mining ended in 1904. The first cinema opened in 1919. In 1926, the town took over operation of the health spa in Warmbad.  In 1929, Wolkenstein was connected to the gas supply from Annaberg, and the local gas works were closed. In the same year, the new town hall was opened. From 1929 to 1931 a bypass road was built, which necessitated a new bridge across the Zschopau river and the railway. An aerial night attack from 14 to 15 February 1945 killed six people, and destroyed or damaged more than 200 buildings. Passenger services on the Pressnitz valley railway ended in 1984, freight services in 1986. The line was subsequently lifted. On 1 January 1999, the hitherto separate municipalities of Falkenbach, Gehringswalde, Hilmersdorf und Schönbrunn joined Wolkenstein. The area of the former paper mill was sold in summer 2003, and a supplier for the automotive, medical, and electrical industry started production of turned parts from there.

The Roman bridge of Lugo crosses the Minho river in Lugo, Galicia. The bridge is of Roman origin and has been rebuilt many times in its history. The bridge was open to traffic until 2012. It was then closed to all vehicles and converted to a pedestrian-only footbridge. The roadway and modern superstructure was replaced with contemporary stonework to complement the bridge's original features.  Features The structure is made primarily of stone and slate, with added metallic walkways. The surface was paved, allowing for continuous vehicle passage, with the exception of heavy vehicles, which were not permitted to cross. It was a frequently used bridge, given its proximity to the Lugo Fluvial Club, among other recreational facilities, and to the Lucense Polyclinic. It was also the most logical route to the Portomarín road or the Lugo Golf Club. Following the construction of the new bridge over the Miño, traffic was diverted to a newly created route for that purpose.  Currently, this bridge is one of the two pedestrian bridges the city has to offer.  History The bridge was designed and built during the Romanization of Galicia. It utilized route number XIX of the Antonine Itinerary, connecting Lucus Augusti with Bracara Augusta (present-day Braga) and passing through Iria Flavia (the current town of Padrón). The reason for its construction was the need to cross the Miño River. Centuries later, during the Late Middle Ages, the bridge underwent significant restorations. This was partly due to its deteriorating condition and also to meet the new transportation needs of the era. With the onset of the Modern Age, further repairs were once again necessary. Ultimately, in 1893, its appearance was definitively altered by the removal of several elements. However, the foundations of the current bridge, often referred to as the "old" or "Roman" bridge, largely remain original. Due to the construction of a new bridge in 2009, the Roman bridge of Lugo was restored and designated for pedestrian use. During the restoration process, the metallic walkways were removed and the asphalt surface was taken out, with efforts made to make it resemble as closely as possible its appearance during Roman times.  Route from the city of Lugo to the Roman bridge The Calzada del Puente, which descends from the Puerta Miñá or Puerta del Carmen (one of the ten gates of the city wall, and also one of the five original ones that is best preserved) to the Roman bridge, is part of the Primitive Pilgrimage Route to Santiago de Compostela. This is also where the hiking route "Las ribeiras altas, Miño arriba" begins, popularly known as the "Paseo del Puente Viejo." This route stretches over eleven kilometers along both banks of the river, heading towards the old light factory.

Pinnacle Mountain is an 8,400-foot (2,560-metre) granitic multi-peak massif located in the Chelan Mountains, in Chelan County of Washington state. The mountain is situated in the Glacier Peak Wilderness of the North Cascades, on land managed by Wenatchee National Forest. Pinnacle Mountain ranks as the fourth-highest peak in the Chelan Mountains, and 77th-highest summit in Washington state. The nearest higher neighbor is Saska Peak, 1.9 mi (3.1 km) to the southeast, and Emerald Peak is positioned 2.25 mi (3.62 km) to the east-southeast. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into the Entiat River and Chelan River drainage basins.  Climate Weather fronts coming off the Pacific Ocean travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snow onto the Cascades. As a result, the North Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.  Geology Pinnacle Mountain is composed primarily of granodiorite and hornblende quartz diorite, minerals of the Cardinal Peak pluton. The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is 20 miles (32 km) west of Pinnacle Mountain, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys is a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Daang Hari (literally the "Road [of the] King"), also known as the Las Piñas–Muntinlupa–Laguna–Cavite Link Road (LPMLC Link Road), is a collector road that links southern Metro Manila to the province of Cavite in the Philippines. It begins as a north–south road from Commerce Avenue, just south of the Alabang–Zapote Road running for 5.9 kilometers (3.7 mi) on the boundary of Las Piñas and Muntinlupa. It then runs east–west for about 9.2 kilometers (5.7 mi) from its junction with Daang Reyna, winding through the cities of Bacoor, Imus, Dasmariñas, and General Trias.  Route description Most of sections of Daang Hari Road is a four-lane median divided highway. A spur road, named Daang Reyna, leads to some gated communities in Dasmariñas, Cavite, Muntinlupa, and San Pedro, Laguna via Magsaysay Road. The spur is mostly a two-lane divided road.  Las Piñas to Muntinlupa Daang Hari's northern terminus is at the junction with Commerce Avenue in Madrigal Business Park near Alabang Town Center where it is a continuation of the short Investment Drive from Alabang–Zapote Road. The road forms the border between Barangay Ayala Alabang and Poblacion of Muntinlupa to the east and Barangay Almanza Dos of Las Piñas to the west. The road passes the following villages from north to south: T.S. Cruz Subdivision, Ayala Alabang, Ayala Southvale, Versailles, Katarungan Village, and Portofino Heights before coming to a roundabout with Daang Reyna and Muntinlupa–Cavite Expressway (MCX) near Evia Lifestyle Center.  Muntinlupa to Imus From the Daang Reyna junction, the road curves sharply to the west and traverses the Molino villages of Bacoor including, from east to west, Verdana Homes, Malipay and Springville South. It intersects with Molino-Paliparan Road where SM Center Molino is located. A few hundred meters west of Molino Paliparan Road, Daang Hari enters Imus passing through Barangay Pasong Buaya before terminating at the intersection with Aguinaldo Highway in Anabu near the boundary with Salitran, Dasmariñas where The District mall is located. A flyover is under construction to divert through traffic on the existing intersection with Aguinaldo Highway. As of 2019, the flyover was now opened to the public.  Imus to General Trias Daang Hari includes an extension to General Trias named Open Canal Road, also named Daang Hari Extension. The original road existed as an access road for irrigation canals maintained by the National Irrigation Authority (NIA). The road passes Lancaster New City Cavite and other nearby subdivisions and some paddy fields before ending at Arnaldo Highway in barangay Pasong Camachile. Open Canal Road runs as a minor local road up to Governor Ferrer Drive. The road is currently under road widening.  History The road was inaugurated on December 13, 2003 as the Las Piñas–Muntinlupa–Laguna–Cavite (LPMLC) Link Road that ran from Ayala Alabang to Molino Road. It was built as part of then-Senator Manny Villar's initiative to decongest traffic in southern Metro Manila. Works by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) on the road was completed in 2005 and is composed of two roads, the Las Piñas–Muntinlupa–San Pedro Road (which include the present Daang Reyna) within Metro Manila, and the original Daang Hari through Bacoor and Imus.  Intersections Daang Hari has no official kilometer count as it is not under the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).  Spur Daang Reyna Daang Reyna, or Vista Avenue, is a 2-kilometer (1.2 mi) spur of Daang Hari, starting from the Daang Hari–MCX Interchange near Evia Lifestyle Center.

Intersections The entire route is located in Las Piñas.    == References ==

Platt Bridge is a settlement in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, Greater Manchester, England, 2 miles (3.2 km) south of Wigan town centre along the spine of the A573 road. Historically part of the Hindley Urban District, in Lancashire, the area is now a residential suburb of Wigan. The first mention of Platt Bridge in documents occurs in 1599. The name comes from "plat" or "platte" meaning a foot-bridge. Platt Bridge borders Abram, Bamfurlong, Hindley and Ince-in-Makerfield. Platt Bridge's border with Bamfurlong is marked by a brook which runs under the A58 and is shown by an ancient marker stone. Two railways pass through Platt Bridge; one, the West Coast Main Line, the other a disused industrial line. Platt Bridge had a railway station on the Manchester and Wigan Railway line that closed in 1969. Two schools in Platt Bridge, Low Hall County Primary School and Saint Nathaniel's C.E. Primary were closed and amalgamated into a new school Platt Bridge Community School, designed by NPS and opened in November 2006. It is a modern 'state-of-the-art' extended school. In addition, there is a Sure Start children's centre, a family centre and a children's and adults' public library. On the site, there is a primary care trust health facility and a housing office. There are four churches in the area: the parish church St Nathaniel's (Church of England), built in 1905; Holy Family & St Wilfrid (Roman Catholic); an Independent Methodist Chapel (Methodist); and a Church of Christ (Churches of Christ). On 31 May 2012, the Olympic Torch procession passed through Platt Bridge en route from Stoke-on-Trent to Bolton.  Site of Special Scientific Interest Bryn Marsh & Ince Moss is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) to the east of Platt Bridge. The 168.8 acre (68.3 hectare) site was designated in 1989 for its biological interest. The main habitats are open water, fen and swamp, mire, woodland, acidic and neutral grassland and ruderal communities. The site is important for its breeding bird populations including: little grebe, great crested grebe, mute swan, tufted duck, common snipe and common redshank. Ten species of dragonfly and damselfly are also found, some of which are locally rare.  References External links "Bryn Marsh & Ince Moss citation sheet" (PDF). English Nature.

The Asahi Group Holdings, Ltd. (アサヒグループホールディングス株式会社, Asahi Gurūpu Hōrudingusu kabushiki gaisha) is a Japanese beverage holding company headquartered in Sumida, Tokyo.   In 2019, the group had revenue of JPY 2.1 trillion. Asahi's business portfolio can be segmented as follows: alcoholic beverage business (40.5%), overseas business (32%), soft drinks business (17.2%), food business (5.4%) and "other" business (4.9%). Asahi, with a 37% market share, is the largest of the four major beer brewers in Japan followed by Kirin Beer with 34% and Suntory with 16%. In response to a maturing domestic Japanese beer market, Asahi broadened its geographic footprint and business portfolio through the acquisition of highly coveted beer businesses in Western Europe and Central Eastern Europe. This has resulted in Asahi having a large market share in many European countries, such as a beer market share of 44% in the Czech Republic, 32% in Poland, 36% in Romania, and 18% in Italy.  History The predecessor of the company, Asahi Breweries (朝日麦酒株式会社), was established in 1889. In 1893, it was reorganized as Ōsaka Breweries (大阪麦酒株式会社). In 1906, Ōsaka Breweries merged with Nippon Breweries and Sapporo Breweries to form Dai-Nippon Breweries (大日本麦酒株式会社, lit. 'Great Japan Beer Company'). During World War I, German prisoners worked in the brewery.  After World War II, the company was divided under the Elimination of Excessive Concentration of Economic Power Law by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. Asahi Breweries (朝日麦酒株式会社) was separated from Nippon Breweries, which is now Sapporo Breweries. In 1989, it was renamed to katakana (アサヒビール株式会社). In 2011, it changed its name to Asahi Group Holdings, a holding company, and established Asahi Breweries Ltd as a subsidiary.  In 1990, Asahi acquired a 19.9% stake in Australian brewery giant Elders IXL which has since become the Foster's Group, later sold to SABMiller. In 2009, Asahi acquired the Australian beverages unit Schweppes Australia, now known as Asahi Beverages. In early 2009, Asahi acquired 19.9% of Tsingtao Brewery from Anheuser-Busch InBev for $667 million. The sale made Asahi Breweries, Ltd. the second largest shareholder in Tsingtao behind only the Tsingtao Brewery Group. In July 2011, Asahi acquired New Zealand juice maker Charlie's and the water and juice divisions of Australian beverage company P&N Beverages. In August 2011, Asahi acquired New Zealand's Independent Liquor, maker of Vodka Cruiser and other alcoholic beverages, for ¥97.6 billion. In May 2013 its New Zealand operations expanded with the purchase of retail chain Mill Liquorsave. Also, Asahi acquired the Australian brands and assets of Cricketers Arms and Mountain Goat Brewery in 2013 and 2015, respectively. The first of these transactions happened as a result of Anheuser-Busch InBev (InBev) agreeing in April 2016 to sell its Dutch business Grolsch Brewery, Italian business Peroni Brewery and the UK's craft Meantime Brewery and SABMiller Brands UK to Asahi; this €2.3 billion deal closed on 12 October 2016. After Inbev's acquisition of SABMiller in October 2016, InBev agreed to sell the former SABMiller Ltd.'s Eastern European businesses and relevant assets in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi for US $7.3 billion. The deal closed on 21 December 2016 and included beer brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Velkopopovický Kozel, Topvar,  Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus. In 2017, the company sold its 19.9% stake of Tsingtao Brewery for $937 million. In 2019, the company bought Fuller's beer business from Fuller, Smith & Turner plc for an enterprise value of £250 million. The assets sold comprised the entirety of Fuller's beer, cider and soft drinks brewing and production, wine wholesaling, as well as the distribution thereof and also includes the Griffin Brewery, Cornish Orchards, Dark Star Brewing and Nectar Imports. In May 2020, the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board approved the company's $16 billion bid for Carlton & United Breweries, and the deal will see Asahi ending up with about 48.5 per cent share of the Australian beer market.  Brands The company's primary beer, from 1957 through the late 1980s, was Asahi Gold (overtaking Asahi Draft, its original formula, which remains in production). However, Asahi Super Dry, introduced in 1987, is now the company's flagship beer brand.  Asahi Super Dry, a product that transformed the modern beer industry in Japan, is described as a highly attenuated lager without the heavier malt flavors of competitors' products, with a crisp, dry taste reminiscent of some northern German beers. This highly successful launch led to a significant rise in consumer demand for dry beer and in turn to a dramatic turnaround in Asahi's business performance, surpassing Kirin in terms of both sales and profitability. Other beers produced include:  Asahi Draft – Lager (first produced in 1892) Asahi Gold – Lager (former flagship product; first produced in 1957) Asahi Stout Asahi Z – Dry lager Asahi Black – a 5% abv dark lager Asahi Prime Time – German Pilsener style lager (only available in Japan) Brands acquired from Anheuser-Busch InBev:  Grolsch Brewery Peroni Brewery Meantime Brewery Gambrinus Pilsner Urquell Radegast Velkopopovický Kozel Tyskie Lech Dreher Ursus Carlton & United Breweries  Asahi Beer Hall Asahi Breweries' headquarters in Tokyo were designed by French designer Philippe Starck.

Frank Peter "Dunie" Ryan Jr. (10 June 1942 – 13 November 1984) was a Canadian gangster and the leader of the West End Gang, a Montreal-based criminal organization.  Criminal career Hoodlum Ryan was born of Irish descent in a poor neighborhood of Montreal. His father, Frank Ryan Sr. abandoned their family when Ryan was three years old, leaving his mother, May, to raise him by herself. Ryan's mother called him "junior", which he mispronounced as "Dunie", which became his lifelong nickname.  Ryan dropped out of school at the age of 16 and led his own teenage gang who participated in "petty" crimes such as smash and grabs, garment thefts from trucks, and breaking and entering. Ryan's specialty as a teenager was in stealing fur coats from delivery trucks and selling them on the black market. By 1962, he already had dozens of convictions for robbery, possession of stolen goods, and possession of a false drivers' license. Ryan was known for his rambunctious and rowdy personality, often saying he wanted to "live fast, love hard and die young". Ryan continued his crime spree throughout the 1960s, being convicted of robbery with violence and of burglary. He served both sentences at the St. Vincent de Paul prison. In 1965, Ryan killed a man while driving drunk. His conviction was overturned on a technicity. Ryan felt a much resentment about being charged for manslaughter, and he came to feel a grudge against the Quebec justice system, which he felt was biased against him. Starting in 1966, Ryan started to frequent the Country Palace on rue Sherbrooke where his biographer, Daniel Burke, wrote: "Hoods from all over the country, but especially the Irish Catholic ghettos, gathered at the Country Palace. Primarily strong arms and bank robbers, the Irish Canadians were an important element of the Montreal underworld, and the nightclub was a mine of contacts for Ryan. There, through the Irish-Canadian links with the Boston underworld, he found the bridge to bigger opportunities and his first costly setback". In 1966, he was convicted of a bank robbery in Boston for which he served 6 years of a 15-year sentence in an American prison. Ryan and four other men robbed the Essex County Bank and Trust on 24 August 1966, but were arrested by the Boston police shortly afterwards. After his parole in December 1972, Ryan joined what was then called the Irish Gang to help him continue his criminal enterprises, which now included loansharking as well as robberies. In 1973, he married Evelyn Lemieux from the Gaspé. Ryan had two children by his wife, Trica and Troy. Ryan had an easy-going personality, which made him popular, and he soon became the leader of the West End Gang. Starting in 1973, Ryan and the West End Gang went on a rampage of robbing jewelry stores and armoured cars for banks. Ryan's favorite place was Smitty's, a run-down bar on rue Sherbrooke, where he played pool, drank and planned robberies with his Irish-Canadian and French-Canadian associates. The West End Gang did have not the same rigid hierarchical structure of the Mafia, and Ryan's status was more as primus inter pares rather as a boss in the traditional sense of the term. Besides for robbing jewelry stores and loansharking, Ryan had the West End Gang start selling hashish, and then heroin and cocaine in the 1970s. Ryan assembled a crew that consisted of Patrick "Hughie" McGurnaghan, Paul April, Allan "The Weasel" Ross, the Matticks brothers, Peter White, and Kenny McPolland as his principle lieutenants. In 1974, Ryan hired as his bodyguard, John "Jake the Snake" McLaughlin, a thief and a hitman suspected of least a dozen murders. McLaughlin was the prime suspect in the murders of George Groom in 1968, James McDonald in 1969, Gary Down in 1970, and Michael French in 1982. The most successful robbery committed by the West End Gang under Ryan's leadership was the theft of $2,275,884 in cash together with golden Olympic coins worth $5,000 dollars from a Brinks armored car on 30 March 1976. The Montreal newspapers called the Brinks robbery of 30 March 1976-which was the largest robbery ever committed in Montreal-the "crime of the century".  On 14 May 1976, one of the West End Gang members involved in the Brinks robbery, John Slawvey, was killed in a shoot-out with the police with detective André Savard killing Slawvey. Ryan was enraged by Slawvey's killing, which he regarded as a cold-blooded execution by the police as he insisted that Slawvey was unarmed and was in the process of surrendering when Savard shot him. Ryan placed a $50,000 contract on Savard's life, which was unprecedented act as never before had a gangster in Montreal placed a contract on the life of a policeman. Savard was forced to living in hiding for some time afterwards. Ultimately no hitman proved willing to take up the contract out of the fear of the police reaction to the killing of a policeman, and Savard came out of hiding.  The "King of Coke" After his initial forays in the drug market, Ryan realized that this was a market that could be expanded. He soon built a drug network that spread throughout Quebec, Ontario and the Atlantic provinces. The West End Gang, as the Irish Gang had been renamed sometime in the late 1970s, took control of the Port of Montreal, which allowed them to smuggle in drugs on a scale that other gangs could not. Through his connections with the Irish Mob of Boston, Ryan started to import cocaine from Colombia and heroin from the "Golden Crescent" nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. Ryan's point-man for the Port of Montreal was Gerald Matticks and his brothers. Ryan was content to be a wholesaler, who sold drugs to the Mafia and the outlaw biker clubs who in turn sold drugs to the street gangs. He also began to engage in fund-raising and gun-running for the Irish Republican Army (IRA), both sending and receiving guns from Northern Ireland. Proud of his Irish heritage, Ryan wore a golden Claddagh ring on his third finger. Ryan was rumored to be worth $20 million, which was possibly an exaggeration, through he was clearly wealthy. Ryan's prize possession was his 36-foot yacht that he sailed on the St. Lawrence River.  By the late 1970s, Ryan developed relationships with other criminal organizations in Montreal, including the Hells Angels and Cotroni crime family. Ryan made a deal with Frank Cotroni that the Controni family would buy drugs exclusively from the West End Gang. As both of these criminal organizations depended on Ryan's steady supply of drugs, Ryan was on the top of the criminal foodchain in Quebec. Ryan was known for his contempt for the other criminal organizations, once saying: "Mafia, pafia. If there's a war, we've got the IRA". Through his American cousin, Peter White, Ryan made an alliance with the Irish Mob of Boston. Ryan also formed an alliance with Yves Buteau, the national president of the Hells Angels, whom became one of his largest customers. Buteau also become Ryan's main subcontractor as Ryan often made use of the services of the Angels' ace assassin, the hitman Yves "Apache" Trudeau. In November 1979, Ryan was subpoenaed to testify at la Commission d'Enuête sur le Crime Organisé who wanted to know why Ryan-who was officially unemployed as he never had a legitimate job once in his life-could afford the mortgage on his house. Ryan testified that during his time in Boston in the 1960s that he had stolen some $100, 000 U.S. dollars in various bank robberies, which he had hidden somewhere, which was the source of his income. Through his claim was not believed, it was not possible for the commissioners to disprove his claim. Despite not having a job, Ryan was able to afford the services of Sidney Leithman who was regarded as one of Montreal's best lawyers and was the preferred defense counsel for gangsters. Leithman successfully defended Ryan several times, and was rewarded with a golden Claddagh ring by Ryan. By 1980, Ryan's base of operations was the bar of the Cavalier Motel on rue St. Jacques, where a collection of criminals would go to meet him at what was known as "the zoo". When another crime figure, Patrick "Hughie" McGurnaghan, cheated Ryan in a drug deal and carried a $100,000 debt, Ryan contacted the Hells Angels' North chapter for assistance. Hells Angels member Trudeau was dispatched to kill McGurnaghan. On 27 October 1981, Trudeau planted a car bomb on McGurnaghan's Mercedes-Benz, killing him and seriously injuring a male passenger. According to police documents, it was believed that Ryan was worth up to $50 million. Ryan was said to have a briefcase full of $500,000 that he kept on his person. Ryan refused advice to retire as he stated: "If your tap was flowing $100 bills, would you turn it off? I've got three hundred guys working for me. What are they gonna do?" By 1982, Ryan was known within the Montreal underworld as the "King of Coke". Ryan was a popular gang boss, who was well liked for his generosity towards his men with one of his followers, John Philips calling him a "honorable thief". Philips recalled that Ryan would "help anybody that came out of the can [prison] anytime! He'd say, 'Well, I'd see what I can for you. Here's five hundred bucks; go get yourselves some clothes and whatever the fuck you need'. Dunnie was like that. He was generous to a fault". Another West End Gang thief, Billy Morgan, called him "a very generous man" who was "very articulate" and "he never got mad. He was a perfect gentleman". In January 1982, Ryan learned that two Hells Angels, Denis "Le Curé" Kennedy and Charles Hachey, were planning to kidnap Ryan's children to force him to forgive their drug debts. Ryan gave an ultimatum to Buteau that either the two would-be kidnappers be killed or else he would cease selling drugs to the biker club. Buteau dispatched Trudeau after the two, whom Trudeau executed after taking them out for drinks in a bar. In 1983, Ryan had become wealthy enough to purchase to a large house at 541 Montrose Drive in the wealthy neighborhood of Beaconsfield, where he lived with his wife and two children.  In 1983, Ryan sent McLaughlin, who proved to be very bloodthirsty as he enjoyed killing people to a farm in New Brunswick owned by Noel Winters with orders to stay there until the media furor caused by his killings in Montreal ceased. Going with McLaughlin to New Brunswick was his girlfriend, Maria Kraus-Hillebrand. On 23 April 1984, the decomposing bodies of McLaughlin and Kraus-Hillebrand were found buried in a shallow grave in a rural area outside of Saint John. Based upon the state of decomposition, the police estimated that McLaughlin and Kraus-Hillebrand had been killed in late 1983, and charged Winters with the murders. Winters believed that Ryan had sent McLaughlin to kill him over an unpaid drug debt, leading to him to strike first. Winters hanged himself in his cell the next day as he believed that Ryan would have him murdered in prison.  Murder Ryan was murdered on 13 November 1984. On the evening of his death, Ryan was at the Nittolo's Jardin Motel on St. Jacques Street West in Montreal when Paul April, a French-Canadian associate, told him there was an attractive young woman waiting to have sex with him in the adjoining room. April and his associate, Robert Lelièvre, who had a shotgun, planned to tie Ryan to a chair and force him to reveal where he had hidden his fortune before killing him. Ryan resisted and threw a chair at Lelièvre, who opened fire with his shotgun. As Ryan lay dying on the floor, someone finished him off by shooting him in the head with a .45 handgun. It is unclear who actually shot Ryan. One of Ryan's killers, Eddie Philips, told his brother, John Philips "I shot a dead man!", claiming he had shot Ryan after his death on the orders of April and Lelièvre. Ryan's killers fled so quickly that they did not take any of the valuables on his corpse. The police found in Ryan's wallet $6,350 in cash along with a gold chain still around his neck and a Rolex watch still on his wrist. Four days later, Ryan's funeral was held at St. Augustine of Canterbury Church in Montreal, attended by his mother May, wife Evelyn, his two children, and another 200 mourners. Among those who attended the funeral were Allan "The Weasel" Ross and  Laurent "L'anglais" Viau, Michel Blass and Yves Trudeau of the Hells Angels. The police observed that after the service had ended that Ross spent much time talking to Viau, the president of the Angels Laval chapter, to which both Blass and Trudeau belonged to. Ryan was replaced as boss of the West End Gang by Ross whose first act as leader was to hire the hitman Yves Trudeau of the Hells Angels' Laval chapter to hunt down and kill those responsible for the murder of Ryan. April and Lelièvre were killed in an apartment bombing less than two weeks later.  Books Auger, Michel; Edwards, Peter (2012).

The Kammaṭṭhāna Forest Tradition of Thailand (from Pali: kammaṭṭhāna [kəmːəʈʈʰaːna] meaning "place of work"), commonly known in the West as the Thai Forest Tradition, is a lineage of Theravada Buddhist monasticism. The Thai Forest Tradition started around 1900 with Ajahn Mun Bhuridatto, who wanted to practice Buddhist monasticism and its meditative practices, according to the normative standards of pre-sectarian Buddhism. After studying with Ajahn Sao Kantasīlo and wandering through the northeast of Thailand, Ajahn Mun reportedly became a non-returner and started to teach in Northeast Thailand. He strove for a revival of the Early Buddhism, insisting on a strict observance of the Buddhist monastic code known as the Vinaya and teaching the practice of jhāna and the realization of nibbāna. Initially, Ajahn Mun's teachings were met with fierce opposition, but in the 1930s his group was acknowledged as a formal faction of Thai Buddhism, and in the 1950s the relationship with the royal and religious establishment improved. In the 1960s, Western students started to be attracted to the movement, and in the 1970s branch monasteries of the tradition began to be established in the West. Underlying attitudes of the Thai Forest Tradition include an interest in the empirical effectiveness of practice, the individual's development, and the use of skill in their practice and living.  History The Dhammayut movement (19th century) Before authority was centralized in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the region known today as Thailand was a kingdom of semi-autonomous city-states (Thai: mueang). These kingdoms were all ruled by a hereditary local governor, and while independent, paid tribute to Bangkok, the most powerful central city-state in the region. Each region had its own religious customs according to local tradition, and substantially different forms of Buddhism existed between mueangs. Though all of these local flavors of regional Thai Buddhism evolved their own customary elements relating to local spirit lore, all were shaped  by the infusion of Mahayana Buddhism and Indian Tantric traditions, which arrived in the area prior to the fourteenth century. Additionally, many of the monastics in the villages engaged in behavior inconsistent with the Buddhist monastic code (Pali: vinaya), including playing board games, and participating in boat races and water fights.   In the 1820s young Prince Mongkut (1804–1866), the future fourth king of the Rattanakosin Kingdom (Siam), was ordained as a Buddhist monk before rising to the throne later in his life. He traveled around the Siamese region and quickly became dissatisfied with the caliber of Buddhist practice he saw around him. He was also concerned about the authenticity of the ordination lineages, and the capacity of the monastic body to act as an agent that generates positive kamma (Pali: puññakkhettam, meaning "merit-field"). Mongkut started to introduce innovations and reforms to a small number of monks, inspired by his contacts with Western intellectuals. He rejected the local customs and traditions, and instead turned to the Pali Canon, studying the texts and developing his own ideas on them. Doubting the validity of the existing lineages, Mongkut searched for a lineage of monks with an authentic practice, which he found among the Burmese Mon people in the region. He reordained among this group, which formed the basis for the Dhammayut movement. Mongkut then searched for replacements for the classical Buddhist texts lost in the final siege of Ayutthaya. He eventually received copies of the Pali Canon as part of a missive to Sri Lanka. With these, Mongkut began a study group to promote understanding of Classical Buddhist principles. Mongkut's reforms were radical, imposing a scriptural orthodoxy on the varied forms of Thai Buddhism of the time, "trying to establish a national identity through religious reform." A controversial point was Mongkut's belief that nibbana can't be reached in our degenerated times and that the aim of the Buddhist order is to promote a moral way of life and preserve the Buddhist traditions. Mongkut's brother Nangklao, King Rama III, the third king of the Rattanakosin Kingdom, considered Mongkut's involvement with the Mons, an ethnic minority, to be improper, and built a monastery on the outskirts of Bangkok. In 1836, Mongkut became the first abbot of Wat Bowonniwet Vihara, which would become the administrative center of the Thammayut order until the present day. The early participants of the movement continued to devote themselves to a combination of textual study and meditations they had discovered from the texts they had received. However, Thanissaro notes that none of the monks could make any claims of having successfully entered meditative concentration (Pali: samadhi), much less having reached a noble level. The Dhammayut reform movement maintained a strong footing as Mongkut later rose to the throne. Over the next several decades the Dhammayut monks would continue with their study and practice.  Formative period (around 1900) The Kammaṭṭhāna Forest Tradition started around 1900 with Ajahn Mun Bhuridatto, who studied with Ajahn Sao Kantasīlo, and wanted to practice Buddhist monasticism, and its meditative practices, according to the normative standards of pre-sectarian Buddhism, which Ajahn Mun termed "the customs of the noble ones".  Wat Liap monastery and Fifth Reign reforms While ordained in the Dhammayut movement, Ajahn Sao (1861–1941) questioned the impossibility to attain nibbana. He rejected the textual orientation of the Dhammayut movement and set out to bring the dhamma into actual practice. In the late nineteenth century he was posted as abbot of Wat Liap, in Ubon. According to Phra Ajahn Phut Thaniyo, one of Ajahn Sao's students, Ajahn Sao was "not a preacher or a speaker, but a doer," who said very little when teaching his students. He taught his students to "Meditate on the word 'Buddho,'" which would aid in developing concentration and mindfulness of meditation objects. Ajahn Mun (1870–1949) went to Wat Liap monastery immediately after being ordained in 1893, where he started to practice kasina-meditation, in which awareness is directed away from the body. While it leads to a state of calm-abiding, it also leads to visions and out-of-body experiences. He then turned to his keeping awareness of his body at all times, taking full sweeps of the body through a walking meditation practice, which leads to a more satisfactory state of calm-abiding.  During this time, Chulalongkorn (1853–1910), the fifth monarch of the Rattanakosin Kingdom, and his brother Prince Wachirayan, initiated a cultural modernization of the entire region. This modernization included an ongoing campaign to homogenize Buddhism among the villages. Chulalongkorn and Wachiraayan were taught by Western tutors and held distaste for the more mystical aspects of Buddhism. They abandoned Mongkut's search for the noble attainments, indirectly stating that the noble attainments were no longer possible. In an introduction to the Buddhist monastic code written by Wachirayan, he stated that the rule forbidding monks to make claims to superior attainments was no longer relevant. During this time, the Thai government enacted legislation to group these factions into official monastic fraternities. The monks ordained as part of the Dhammayut reform movement were now part of the Dhammayut order, and all remaining regional monks were grouped together as the Mahanikai order.  Wandering non-returner After his stay at Wat Liap, Ajaan Mun wandered through the Northeast. Ajahn Mun still had visions, when his concentration and mindfulness were lost, but through trial and error he eventually found a method for taming his mind. As his mind gained more inner stability, he gradually headed towards Bangkok, consulting his childhood friend Chao Khun Upali on practices pertaining to the development of insight (Pali: paññā, also meaning "wisdom" or "discernment"). He then left for an unspecified period, staying in caves in Lopburi, before returning to Bangkok one final time to consult with Chao Khun Upali, again pertaining to the practice of paññā. Feeling confident in his paññā practice he left for Sarika Cave. During his stay there, Ajahn Mun was critically ill for several days. After medicines failed to remedy his illness, Ajahn Mun ceased to take medication and resolved to rely on the power of his Buddhist practice. Ajahn Mun investigated the nature of the mind and this pain, until his illness disappeared, and successfully coped with visions featuring a club-wielding demon apparition who claimed he was the owner of the cave. According to forest tradition accounts, Ajahn Mun attained the noble level of non-returner (Pali: "anagami") after subduing this apparition and working through subsequent visions he encountered in the cave.  Establishment and resistance (1900s–1930s) Establishment Ajahn Mun returned to the Northeast to start teaching, which marked the effective beginning of the Kammatthana tradition. He insisted on a scrupulous observance of the Vinaya, the Buddhist monastic code, and of the protocols, the instructions for the daily activities of the monk. He taught that virtue was a matter of the mind, not of rituals, and that intention forms the essence of virtue, not the proper conduct of rituals. He asserted that meditative concentration was necessary on the Buddhist path and that the practice of jhana and the experience of Nirvana was still possible even in modern times.  Resistance Ajahn Mun's approach met with resistance from the religious establishment. He challenged the text-based approach of the city-monks, opposing their claims about the non-attainability of jhāna and nibbāna with his own experience-based teachings. His report of having reached a noble attainment was met with mixed reactions among the Thai clergy. The ecclesiastical official Ven. Chao Khun Upali held Ajahn Mun in high esteem, which would be a significant factor in the subsequent leeway that state authorities gave him and his students. Tisso Uan (1867–1956), who later rose to Thailand's highest ecclesiastical rank of somdet, thoroughly rejected the authenticity of Ajahn Mun's attainment. The tension between the forest tradition and the Thammayut administrative hierarchy escalated in 1926 when Tisso Uan attempted to drive a senior Forest Tradition monk named Ajahn Sing—along with his following of 50 monks and 100 nuns and laypeople—out of Ubon, which was under Tisso Uan's jurisdiction. Ajahn Sing refused, saying he and many of his supporters were born there, and they weren't doing anything to harm anyone. After arguments with district officials, the directive was eventually dropped.  Institutionalisation and growth (1930s–1990s) Acceptance in Bangkok In the late 1930s, Tisso Uan formally recognized the Kammaṭṭhāna monks as a faction. However, even after Ajahn Mun died in 1949, Tisso Uan continued to insist that Ajahn Mun had never been qualified to teach because he hadn't graduated from the government's formal Pali studies courses. With the passing of Ajahn Mun in 1949, Ajahn Thate Desaransi was designated the de facto head of the Forest Tradition until his death in 1994. The relationship between the Thammayut ecclesia and the Kammaṭṭhāna monks changed in the 1950s when Tisso Uan become ill and Ajahn Lee went to teach meditation to him to help cope with his illness.  Tisso Uan eventually recovered, and a friendship between Tisso Uan and Ajahn Lee began, that would cause Tisso Uan to reverse his opinion of the Kammaṭṭhāna tradition, inviting Ajahn Lee to teach in the city. This event marked a turning point in relations between the Dhammayut administration and the Forest Tradition, and interest continued to grow as a friend of Ajahn Maha Bua's named Nyanasamvara rose to the level of somdet and later the Sangharaja of Thailand. Additionally, the clergy who had been drafted as teachers from the Fifth Reign onwards were now being displaced by civilian teaching staff, which left the Dhammayut monks with a crisis of identity.  Recording of forest doctrine In the tradition's beginning the founders famously neglected to record their teachings, instead wandering the Thai countryside offering individual instruction to dedicated pupils. However, detailed meditation manuals and treatises on Buddhist doctrine emerged in the late 20th century from Ajahn Mun and Ajahn Sao's first-generation students as the Forest tradition's teachings began to propagate among the urbanities in Bangkok and subsequently take root in the West. Ajahn Lee, one of Ajahn Mun's students, was instrumental in disseminating Mun's teachings to a wider Thai lay audience. Ajahn Lee wrote several books which recorded the doctrinal positions of the forest tradition and explained broader Buddhist concepts in the Forest Tradition's terms. Ajahn Lee and his students are considered a distinguishable sub-lineage that is sometimes referred to as the "Chanthaburi Line". An influential Western student in the line of Ajahn Lee is Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Forest monasteries in the South   Ajahn Buddhadasa Bhikkhu (May 27, 1906 - May 25, 1993) became a Buddhist monk at Wat Ubon, Chaiya, Surat Thani in Thailand on July 29, 1926, when he was twenty years old, in part to follow the tradition of the day and to fulfill his mother’s wishes. His preceptor gave him the Buddhist name  “Inthapanyo” which means “The wise one”. He was a Mahanikaya monk and graduated at the third level of Dharma studies in his hometown and in Pali language studies at the third level in Bangkok. After he finished learning the Pali language, he realized that living in Bangkok was not suitable for him because monks and people there did not practice to achieve the heart and core of Buddhism. So he decided to go back to Surat Thani and practice rigorously and taught people to practice well according to the core teachings of the Buddha. Then he established Suanmokkhabālārama (The Grove of the Power of Liberation) in 1932 which is the mountain and forest for 118.61 acres at Pum Riang, Chaiya district, Surat Thani Thailand. It is a forest Dhamma and Vipassana meditation center. In 1989, he founded The Suan Mokkh International Dharma Hermitage for international Vipassana meditation practitioners around the world. There is a 10-day silent meditation retreat that starts on the 1st of each month for the whole year which is free, of no charge for international practitioners who are interested in practicing meditation. He was a central monk in the popularization of the Thai Forest Tradition in the South of Thailand. He was a great Dhamma author who wrote many well-known Dhamma books: Handbook for Mankind, Heart-wood from the Bo Tree, Keys to Natural Truth, Me and Mine, Mindfulness of Breathing and The A, B, Cs of Buddhism etc. On October 20, 2005, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) announced praise to “Buddhadasa Bhikkhu”, an important person in the world and celebrated the 100th anniversary on May 27, 2006. They held an academic activity to disseminate the Buddhist principles that Ajahn Buddhadasa had taught people around the world. So, he was the practitioner of a great Thai Forest Tradition who practiced well and spread Dhammas for people around the world to realize the core and heart of Buddhism.  Forest monasteries in the West Ajahn Chah (1918–1992) was a central person in the popularisation of the Thai Forest Tradition in the west. In contrast to most members of the Forest Tradition he was not a Dhammayut monk, but a Mahanikaya monk. He only spent one weekend with Ajahn Mun, but had teachers within the Mahanikaya who had more exposure to Ajahn Mun. His connection to the Forest Tradition was publicly recognized by Ajahn Maha Bua. The community that he founded is formally referred to as The Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah. In 1967, Ajahn Chah founded Wat Pah Pong. That same year, an American monk from another monastery, Venerable Sumedho (Robert Karr Jackman, later Ajahn Sumedho) came to stay with Ajahn Chah at Wat Pah Pong. He found out about the monastery from one of Ajahn Chah's existing monks who happened to speak "a little bit of English". In 1975, Ajahn Chah and Sumedho founded Wat Pah Nanachat, an international forest monastery in Ubon Ratchatani which offers services in English. In the 1980s the Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah expanded to the West with the founding of Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in the UK. Ajahn Chah stated that the spread of Communism in Southeast Asia motivated him to establish the Forest Tradition in the West. The Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah has since expanded to cover Canada, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and the United States.  Involvement in politics (1994–2011) Royal patronage and instruction to the elite With the passing of Ajahn Thate in 1994, Ajahn Maha Bua was designated the new Ajahn Yai. By this time, the Forest Tradition's authority had been fully routinized, and Ajahn Maha Bua had grown a following of influential conservative-loyalist Bangkok elites. He was introduced to the Queen and King by Somdet Nyanasamvara Suvaddhano (Charoen Khachawat), instructing them how to meditate.  Forest closure In recent times, the Forest Tradition has undergone a crisis surrounding the destruction of forests in Thailand. Since the Forest Tradition had gained significant pull from the royal and elite support in Bangkok, the Thai Forestry Bureau decided to deed large tracts of forested land to Forest Monasteries, knowing that the forest monks would preserve the land as a habitat for Buddhist practice. The land surrounding these monasteries have been described as "forest islands" surrounded by barren clear-cut area.  Save Thai Nation In the midst of the Thai Financial crisis in the late 1990s, Ajahn Maha Bua initiated Save Thai Nation—a campaign which aimed to raise capital to underwrite the Thai currency. By the year 2000, 3.097 tonnes of gold was collected. By the time of Ajahn Maha Bua's death in 2011, an estimated 12 tonnes of gold had been collected, valued at approximated US$500 million. 10.2 million dollars of foreign exchange was also donated to the campaign. All proceeds were handed over to the Thai central bank to back the Thai Baht. The Thai administration under Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai attempted to thwart the Save Thai Nation campaign in the late 1990s. This led to Ajahn Maha Bua's striking back with heavy criticism, which is cited as a contributing factor to the ousting of Chuan Leekpai and the election of Thaksin Shinawatra as prime minister in 2001. The Dhammayut hierarchy, teaming-up with the Mahanikaya hierarchy and seeing the political influence that Ajahn Maha Bua could wield, felt threatened and began to take action. In the late 2000s bankers at the Thai central bank attempted to consolidate the bank's assets and move the proceeds from the Save Thai Nation campaign into the ordinary accounts which discretionary spending comes out of. The bankers received pressure from Ajahn Maha Bua's supporters which effectively prevented them from doing this. On the subject, Ajahn Maha Bua said that "it is clear that combining the accounts is like tying the necks of all Thais together and throwing them into the sea; the same as turning the land of the nation upside down." In addition to Ajahn Maha Bua's activism for Thailand's economy, his monastery is estimated to have donated some 600 million Baht (US$19 million) to charitable causes.  Politic interest and death of Ajahn Maha Bua Throughout the 2000s, Ajahn Maha Bua was accused of political leanings—first from Chuan Leekpai supporters, and then receiving criticism from the other side after his vehement condemnations of Thaksin Shinawatra. Ajahn Maha Bua was the last of Ajahn Mun's prominent first-generation students. He died in 2011. In his will he requested that all of the donations from his funeral be converted to gold and donated to the Central Bank—an additional 330 million Baht and 78 kilograms of gold.  Practices Meditation practices The purpose of practice is to attain the deathless (Pali: amata-dhamma), i.e. Nibbāna. According to the Thai Forest Tradition's exposition, awareness of the deathless is boundless and unconditioned and cannot be conceptualized, and must be arrived at through mental training which includes states of meditative concentration (Pali: jhana). Forest teachers thus directly challenge the notion of "dry insight" (insight without any development of concentration), and teach that nibbāna must be arrived at through mental training which includes deep states of meditative concentration (Pali: jhāna), and "exertion and striving" to "cut" or "clear the path" through the "tangle" of defilements, setting awareness free, and thus allowing one to see them clearly for what they are, eventually leading one to be released from these defilements.  Kammaṭṭhāna — The Place of Work Kammaṭṭhāna, (Pali: meaning “place of work”) refers to the whole of the practice with the goal of ultimately eradicating defilement from the mind. The practice which monks in the tradition generally begin with are meditations on what Ajahn Mun called the five "root meditation themes": the hair of the head, the hair of the body, the nails, the teeth, and the skin. One of the purposes of meditating on these externally visible aspects of the body is to counter the infatuation with the body, and to develop a sense of dispassion. Of the five, the skin is described as being especially significant. Ajahn Mun writes that "When we get infatuated with the human body, the skin is what we are infatuated with. When we conceive of the body as being beautiful and attractive, and develop love, desire, and longing for it, it's because of what we conceive of the skin." Advanced meditations include the classical themes of contemplation and mindfulness of breathing:  The ten recollections: a list of ten meditation themes considered especially significant by the Buddha. The asubha contemplations: contemplations of foulness for combating sensual desire. The brahmaviharas: assertions of good-will for all beings to combat ill-will. The four satipatthana: frames of reference to get the mind into deep concentration Mindfulness immersed in the body and mindfulness of in-and-out breathing (ānāpānasati) are both part of the ten recollections and the four satipatthana, and are commonly given special attention as primary themes for a meditator to focus on.  Monastic routine Precepts and ordination There are several precept levels: Five Precepts, Eight Precepts, Ten Precepts and the patimokkha. The Five Precepts (Pañcaśīla in Sanskrit and Pañcasīla in Pāli) are practiced by laypeople, either for a given period of time or for a lifetime. The Eight Precepts are a more rigorous practice for laypeople. Ten Precepts are the training-rules for sāmaṇeras and sāmaṇerīs (novitiate monks and nuns). The Patimokkha is the basic Theravada code of monastic discipline, consisting of 227 rules for bhikkhus and 311 for nuns bhikkhunis (nuns).[14] Temporary or short-term ordination is so common in Thailand that men who have never been ordained are sometimes referred to as "unfinished." Long-term or lifetime ordination is deeply respected. The ordination process usually begins as an anagarika, in white robes.[15]  Customs Monks in the tradition are typically addressed as "Venerable", alternatively with the Thai Ayya or Taan (for men). Any monk may be addressed as "bhante" regardless of seniority. For Sangha elders who have made a significant contribution to their tradition or order, the title Luang Por (Thai: Venerable Father) may be used.[16] According to The Isaan: "In Thai culture, it is considered impolite to point the feet toward a monk or a statue in the shrine room of a monastery."[17] In Thailand monks are usually greeted by lay people with the wai gesture, though, according to Thai custom, monks are not supposed to wai laypeople.[18] When making offerings to the monks, it is best not to stand while offering something to a monk who is sitting down.[19]  Daily routine All Thai monasteries generally have a morning and evening chant, which usually takes an hour long for each, and each morning and evening chant may be followed by a meditation session, usually around an hour as well.[20] At Thai monasteries the monks will go for alms early in the morning, sometimes around 6:00 AM,[21] although monasteries such as Wat Pah Nanachat and Wat Mettavanaram start around 8:00 AM and 8:30 AM, respectively.[22][23] At Dhammayut monasteries (and some Maha Nikaya forest monasteries, including Wat Pah Nanachat),[24] monks will eat just one meal per day. For young children it is customary for the parent to help them scoop food into monks bowls. At Dhammayut monasteries, anumodana (Pali, rejoicing together) is a chant performed by the monks after a meal to recognize the mornings offerings, as well as the monks' approval for the lay people's choice of generating merit (Pali: puñña) by their generosity towards the Sangha.  Retreats Dhutanga (meaning "austere practice" Thai) is a word generally used in the commentaries to refer to the thirteen ascetic practices. In Thai Buddhism it has been adapted to refer to extended periods of wandering in the countryside, where monks will take one or more of these ascetic practices.[25] During these periods monks will live off of whatever is given to them by laypersons they encounter during the trip, and sleep wherever they can. Sometimes monks will bring a large umbrella-tent with attached mosquito netting known as a crot (also spelled krot, clot, or klod). The crot will usually have a hook on the top so it may be hung on a line tied between two trees.[26]  Teachings Original mind The mind (Pali: citta, mano, used interchangeably as "heart" or "mind" en masse), within the context of the Forest Tradition, refers to the most essential aspect of an individual, that carries the responsibility of "taking on" or "knowing" mental preoccupations. While the activities associated with thinking are often included when talking about the mind, they are considered mental processes separate from this essential knowing nature, which is sometimes termed the "primal nature of the mind".  Original Mind is considered to be radiant, or luminous (Pali: "pabhassara"). Teachers in the forest tradition assert that the mind simply "knows and does not die." The mind is also a fixed-phenomenon (Pali: "thiti-dhamma"); the mind itself does not move or follow out after its preoccupations, but rather receives them in place. Since the mind as a phenomenon often eludes attempts to define it, the mind is often simply described in terms of its activities. The primal or original mind in itself is however not considered to be equivalent to the awakened state but rather as a basis for the emergence of mental formations, it is not to be confused for a metaphysical statement of a true self and its radiance being an emanation of avijjā it must eventually be let go of. Ajahn Mun further argued that there is a unique class of "objectless" or "themeless" consciousness specific to Nirvana, which differs from the consciousness aggregate. Scholars in Bangkok at the time of Ajahn Mun stated that an individual is wholly composed of and defined by the five aggregates, while the Pali Canon states that the aggregates are completely ended during the experience of Nirvana.  Twelve nidanas and rebirth The twelve nidanas describe how, in a continuous process, avijja ("ignorance," "unawareness") leads to the mind's preoccupation with its contents and the associated feelings that arise from sense-contact. This absorption darkens the mind and becomes a "defilement" (Pali: kilesa), which lead to craving and clinging (Pali: upadana). This in turn leads to becoming, which conditions birth. While birth is traditionally explained as rebirth in a new life, it is also explained in Thai Buddhism as the birth of self-view, which gives rise to renewed clinging and craving.  Teachers Ajahn Mun When Ajahn Mun returned to the Northeast to start teaching, he brought a set of radical ideas, many of which clashed with what scholars in Bangkok were saying at the time:  Like Mongkut, Ajahn Mun stressed the importance of scrupulous observance of the Buddhist monastic code (Pali: Vinaya). Ajahn Mun went further, and also stressed what are called the protocols: instructions for how a monk should go about daily activities such as keeping his hut, interacting with other people, etc.Ajahn Mun also taught that virtue was a matter of the mind, and that intention forms the essence of virtue. This ran counter to what people in Bangkok said at the time, that virtue was a matter of ritual, and by conducting the proper ritual one gets good results. Ajahn Mun asserted that the practice of jhana was still possible even in modern times, and that meditative concentration was necessary on the Buddhist path. Ajahn Mun stated that one's meditation topic must be keeping in line with one's temperament—everyone is different, so the meditation method used should be different for everybody. Ajahn Mun said the meditation topic one chooses should be congenial and enthralling, but also give one a sense of unease and dispassion for ordinary living and the sensual pleasures of the world. Ajahn Mun said that not only was the practice of jhana possible, but the experience of Nirvana was too. He stated that Nirvana was characterized by a state of activityless consciousness, distinct from the consciousness aggregate.To Ajahn Mun, reaching this mode of consciousness is the goal of the teaching—yet this consciousness transcends the teachings. Ajahn Mun asserted that the teachings are abandoned at the moment of Awakening, in opposition to the predominant scholarly position that Buddhist teachings are confirmed at the moment of Awakening. Along these lines, Ajahn Mun rejected the notion of an ultimate teaching, and argued that all teachings were conventional—no teaching carried a universal truth. Only the experience of Nirvana, as it is directly witnessed by the observer, is absolute.  Ajahn Lee Ajahn Lee emphasized his metaphor of Buddhist practice as a skill, and reintroduced the Buddha's idea of skillfulness—acting in ways that emerge from having trained the mind and heart. Ajahn Lee said that good and evil both exist naturally in the world, and that the skill of the practice is ferreting out good and evil, or skillfulness from unskillfulness. The idea of "skill" refers to a distinction in Asian countries between what is called warrior-knowledge (skills and techniques) and scribe-knowledge (ideas and concepts). Ajahn Lee brought some of his own unique perspectives to Forest Tradition teachings:  Ajahn Lee reaffirmed that meditative concentration (samadhi) was necessary, yet further distinguished between right concentration and various forms of what he called wrong concentration—techniques where the meditator follows awareness out of the body after visions, or forces awareness down to a single point were considered by Ajahn Lee as off-track. Ajahn Lee stated that discernment (panna) was mostly a matter of trial-and-error. He used the metaphor of basket-weaving to describe this concept: you learn from your teacher, and from books, basically how a basket is supposed to look, and then you use trial-and-error to produce a basket that is in line with what you have been taught about how baskets should be. These teachings from Ajahn Lee correspond to the factors of the first jhana known as directed-thought (Pali: "vitakka"), and evaluation (Pali: "vicara"). Ajahn Lee said that the qualities of virtue that are worked on correspond to the qualities that need to be developed in concentration. Ajahn Lee would say things like "don't kill off your good mental qualities", or "don't steal the bad mental qualities of others", relating the qualities of virtue to mental qualities in one's meditation.  Ajahn Maha Bua Ajahn Mun and Ajahn Lee would describe obstacles that commonly occurred in meditation but would not explain how to get through them, forcing students to come up with solutions on their own. Additionally, they were generally very private about their own meditative attainments. Ajahn Maha Bua, on the other hand, saw what he considered to be a lot of strange ideas being taught about meditation in Bangkok in the later decades of the 20th century. For that reason Ajahn Maha Bua decided to vividly describe how each noble attainment is reached, even though doing so indirectly revealed that he was confident he had attained a noble level. Though the Vinaya prohibits a monk from directly revealing ones own or another's attainments to laypeople while that person is still alive, Ajahn Maha Bua wrote in Ajahn Mun's posthumous biography that he was convinced that Ajahn Mun was an arahant. Thanissaro Bhikkhu remarks that this was a significant change of the teaching etiquette within the Forest Tradition.  Ajahn Maha Bua's primary metaphor for Buddhist practice was that it was a battle against the defilements. Just as soldiers might invent ways to win battles that aren't found in military history texts, one might invent ways to subdue defilement. Whatever technique one could come up with—whether it was taught by one's teacher, found in the Buddhist texts, or made up on the spot—if it helped with a victory over the defilements, it counted as a legitimate Buddhist practice.  Ajahn Maha Bua is widely known for his teachings on dealing with physical pain. For a period, Ajahn Maha Bua had a student who was dying of cancer, and Ajahn Maha Bua gave a series on talks surrounding the perceptions that people have that create mental problems surrounding the pain. Ajahn Maha Bua said that these incorrect perceptions can be changed by posing questions about the pain in the mind. (i.e. "what color is the pain? does the pain have bad intentions to you?" "Is the pain the same thing as the body? What about the mind?") There was a widely publicized incident in Thailand where monks in the North of Thailand were publicly stating that Nirvana is the true self, and scholar monks in Bangkok were stating that Nirvana is not-self. (see: Dhammakaya Movement)At one point, Ajahn Maha Bua was asked whether Nirvana was self or not-self and he replied "Nirvana is Nirvana, it is neither self nor not-self". Ajahn Maha Bua stated that not-self is merely a perception that is used to pry one away from infatuation with the concept of a self, and that once this infatuation is gone the idea of not-self must be dropped as well.

Chaas (gu:છાશ chhash, hi:छाछ chhachh) is a curd-based drink popular across the Indian subcontinent. In Magahi (Magahi Language) and Bundeli, it is called Mattha. In Rajasthani it is called ghol, in Odia it is called Ghol/Chaash, moru in Tamil and Malayalam, taak in Marathi, majjiga in Telugu, majjige in Kannada, ale (pronounced a-lay) in Tulu and ghol in Bengali. In Indian English, it is often referred to as buttermilk.  Etymology The name Chaas or Chaach is derived from Sanskrit word Chacchika (छच्छिका), meaning churned yogurt from which butter has been removed.  Preparation and variations Chaas is made by churning yogurt (curds/dahi) and cold water together in a pot, using a hand-held instrument called madhani (whipper). This can be consumed plain or seasoned with a variety of spices or made sweet (and then known as Lassi). Chaas can be made from fresh yogurt, and the natural flavour of such chaas is mildly sweet.  Seasoning and flavours Chaas can be consumed plain, but a little salt is usually added. This is the most common seasoning for chaas. Numerous other seasonings and spices can be added to salted chaas, either singly or in combination with each other. These spices are usually roasted in a wok, using a spoonful of cooking oil, before being added to the Chaas. The spices which can be added thus are: Coarsely ground and roasted cumin seeds, curry leaves, asafoetida, grated ginger, very finely diced green chillies and Mustard seeds. Sugar can also be added to chaas, but if sugar is added, then neither salt nor spice is usually used.  Vendors have come up with several proprietary products and standardized flavours of chaas which are produced on an industrial scale and sold as bottled drinks. The best-seller among such brands is Amul's Masala Chaas, which has standardized several traditional flavours for the mass bottled-drink market. Other popular modern flavours available as bottled drinks include rose-flavoured Chaas Gulabi and mint-flavoured Mint Chaas.  Consumption In the rural areas of India, the consumption of chaas has cultural resonances and associations which are not found in the context of other beverages like tea, coffee or lassi. An earthenware pot is used to prepare chaas and store it for a few hours before consumption. Using earthenware to store the chaas helps keep it cool without the need to refrigerate it, even in the height of summer. In the extremely hot desert areas of Gujarat and Rajasthan, people consume chaas with salt after getting exposed to the sun because this may aid rehydration. Chaas or Moru is consumed more in Southern India as it rehydrates the body from the hot climate. Chaas is consumed all year round. It is usually taken immediately after meals, but is also consumed on its own as a beverage. People also consume chaas for its health benefits. The condiments in chaas, especially pepper and ginger, help reduce the burning sensation felt with acidity. Those spices also help improve digestion. Chaas is also packed with electrolytes and water, helping the body recover from dehydration.

"Christmas" is the eleventh episode of the first season of the American television police sitcom series Brooklyn Nine-Nine. The episode was written by series co-creator Dan Goor and directed by Jake Szymanski. It aired on Fox in the United States on December 3, 2013. In this episode, Holt receives death threats and per protocol, Peralta is assigned as his guardian, much to the latter's joy. However, the situation is worse than he thought. The episode was seen by an estimated 3.66 million household viewers and gained a 1.6/5 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised Braugher's performance. Braugher was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance in the episode.  Plot In the cold open, Jake and Boyle attempt to break up a fight between two Santas in front of kids. During Christmas season, Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is informed by Deputy Chief Gerber (Mark Berry) that Holt (Andre Braugher) has received death threats. Due to security protocols, Peralta has been chosen to watch Holt, which requires him to control every move he makes. Peralta tricks Holt into going to a safe house, handcuffs him to himself, and then throws the key through a vent. Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews) sees a therapist for a psychiatric evaluation to determine if he can go back into the field. Despite showing no signs of a right analysis, he checks himself out after an emergency resurfaces. Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) visits the safe house after Holt secretly sends him a message to bring him to the precinct. Ultimately, Boyle, Peralta, and Holt end up handcuffed together. After an investigation, Holt discovers that the death threats came from a killer (Kirk Bovill) he pursued years ago and sets out to find him at a train station. The killer is arrested, but shoots Boyle when he jumps in to save Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz). The gang is notified that Boyle will recover soon.  Reception Viewers In its original American broadcast, "Christmas" was seen by an estimated 3.66 million household viewers and gained a 1.6/5 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a slight decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.69 million viewers with a 1.5/4 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 1.6 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 5 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the most watched show on FOX for the night, beating Dads and The Mindy Project, third on its timeslot and fifth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind a rerun of NCIS, The Biggest Loser, Chicago Fire, and The Voice.  Critical reviews "Christmas" received positive reviews from critics. Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a "good" 7.9 out of 10 and wrote, "Brooklyn Nine-Nine's 'Christmas' found a clever way to create a Yuletide backdrop without delivering another entirely holiday-themed episode so quickly after Thanksgiving. Holt's history as a hothead adds a nice new element to his relationship with Peralta. Though this was another strong and funny episode, it wasn't quite as hilarious as the previous few installments. Overall, another solid entry, though. Nothing says Christmas cheer like coming together to combat death threats." Molly Eichel of The A.V. Club gave the episode a "B" grade and wrote, "'Christmas' may not have been my favorite entry so far, but it's a good marker as a midway point. It highlights what's great about the series—a game ensemble who gelled early in the series' life — and what doesn't work so well—a lead who is still not as compelling or as much fun to watch as everyone else around him. But if Holt can change from the Afro'd over -emoter to the stoic center of the Nine-Nine, maybe there's hope for Peralta yet." Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, "So I spent a lot of the A-story feeling the same way I did with some of those earlier episodes: wishing we would quickly get back to the other supporting characters. And that stuff was fun, whether Terry struggling with his fears in front of the shrink, Santiago scheming to get Diaz to smile or Boyle worrying about his flight, and then getting to play hero in an amazing and yet embarrassing way. Holt pop-and-locking in and of itself made this one a must-see, but I think the episode could have been a lot more." Aaron Channon of Paste gave the episode a 7.3 out of 10 and wrote, "Unfortunately, this accounts for the meat of the episode, and it is largely unentertaining save for a few scattered Sambergisms and Braugherisms. It is true that the uncapitalized-upon potential in this scenario is a minor failure by the writers, but more significantly it shows how much the success of the series thus far has come to rely on the supporting cast. Where 'Thanksgiving' excelled by placing the entire cast together in one room, 'Christmas' fails by separating the detectives of the nine-nine into three separate arcs."

Gjeto Basho Muji or simply Muji is a legendary Albanian warrior from "Songs of the Heroes" Albanian folktale ballads. It is revered as one of the most important legendary heroes of Albanian folklore in Northern Albania, Kosovo, and among the Malësor Albanians of Montenegro.  The main theme of the cycle is the brave warfare between the Albanian heroes (Albanian: kreshnikë or trima, and aga), who have supernatural strength and an extremely large body holding ordinary family lives, and opposing Slavic warriors (Albanian: shkje and krajla), who are likewise powerful and brave, but without besë.  Overview Legendary creatures of this Albanian epic songs belong to the repertoire of the general Mediterranean mythology. Among the main legendary creatures and animals are The Mountain Fairy (Albanian:Zana e Malit), supernatural female mythological figures, and birds, which are able to speak like humans and aid or inform the main hero about the events that happened or will happen in the future. The songs are the product of a mountain tribal society in which blood kinship (Albanian: fis) is the foundation, and the Kanun, a code of Albanian oral customary laws, direct all the aspects of the social organization.  In particular, peculiar traits of the two brothers and main characters of the epic cycle, Muji and Halili, are considered to be analogous to those of the Ancient Greek Dioscuri and their equivalents among the early Germans, Celts, Armenians, Indians, and other ancient peoples, who trace back to the common Proto-Indo-European Divine twins. The approximate timeline of events focus around the fight between Albanians and Slavic tribes during the Ottoman Period, but the stories are evolved variant of older mythological stories of Albania before the Ottoman  occupation since there are similar stories between Arbëresh population of Italy, like The Twins, which left Albania before The Ottoman Occupation.  Legend The legend is focused on the story of two brothers who spent their whole lives fighting with swords and spears. Muji's power was not supernatural until one day he drank milk from the Mountain Fairy. Muji became so strong that when a passer-by had asked him where a village was, Muji, who had been plowing the field, raised his hands along with the plow and pointed in the direction of that village.  Muji's power was a contrast with his brother whose strongest skill was the agility. A formidable warrior, he fought with swords, spears and bare handed.  In order to protect their Albanian lands, they had fought against Krajl's (Slavic lord) soldiers and the Ottoman Sultan's vassals. His first deed was against Slavic bandits known as "Harambash gangs", which at that time had committed robberies, burnings and murders among the Albanian tribes.  History Hypotheses based on numerous parallels between the motifs of the Albanian Cycle of the Kreshniks and the Balkan History of the 6th-7th centuries presuppose the origin of the name Muji and some of the legendary information about him from the name and history of the Byzantine Emperor Maurice Tiberius, the last ruler of the Dardanian dynasty of the Justinians. Similarly, the name of his wife, Ajkuna (or Kuna), corresponds to that of the Empress Aelia Constantina, the wife of Maurice, if we take into account the laws of phonetic evolution of the Albanian language since Late Antiquity.
