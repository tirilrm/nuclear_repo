      "The US Department of Energy, he said, is studying ways to bail out nuclear (and coal) facilities, including potentially by mandating grid operators to purchase power from them.\n",
      "Supporters say it’s a sensible move because the nation’s power grid cannot rely solely on natural gas, wind, and solar. Opponents of the nuclear industry say nuclear power that was once advertised as being “too cheap to meter” has become too costly for electric utilities to buy. \n",
      "The US has the largest number of nuclear plants in the world – 99 in commercial operation providing 20% of its electricity generation – but its industry leadership is declining as efforts to build a new generation of reactors have been plagued by problems, and ageing plants have been retired or closed in the face of economic, market, and financial pressures.\n",
      "The situation, exacerbated by robust competition in the new-build sector from China and Russia, has seen the nuclear industry and its supporters call on the government to enact legislation that would support the continued operation of nuclear plants.\n",
      "But the main reason behind nuclear’s problems in the US, says Dr J. Winston Porter, a national energy and environmental consultant and former assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency, is a shale revolution that has produced a rapid supply of inexpensive and relatively clean natural gas. \n",
      "“Because of this we are becoming increasingly dependent on it for most electricity production,” he said. “Consequently, we risk losing the energy diversity that has long served as a bulwark of the US energy system. \n",
      "“The problem may be an eventual lack of robust competition. One can even ask, ‘What will be the cost of natural gas when it is our only major source of electric power?’”\n"
