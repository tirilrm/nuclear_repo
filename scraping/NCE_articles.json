            "The Conservative Party says it will speed up the average time it takes to consent major infrastructure projects from four years to one if it is in power following the General Election.",
            "Conservative Party Manifesto 2024",
            "also promises an order of two fleets of small modular reactors (SMRs) with in the party’s first 100 days in office among other actions to “prioritise our energy security”.",
            "Speeding up infrastructure delivery",
            "Among its actions to speed up infrastructure delivery, the Tory party pledges to “introduce reforms to outdated EU red tape to better protect nature while enabling the building of new homes, new prisons and new energy schemes”. This will reform the “EU’s bureaucratic environmental impact assessment regime” to speed up local and national infrastructure planning systems.",
            "The party will ensure that “requirements to offset the impact of new infrastructure and homes on an area are proportionate, without compromising environmental outcomes”.",
            "Quicker changes to consented projects will be allowed, reducing the cost of infrastructure, according to the party.",
            "National Policy Statements will be regularly updated under a new Conservative government.",
            "The reformed planning system will ensure that statutory consultees on major infrastructure will focus on “improving projects in line with clearer objectives, rather than piecemeal requirements that add delays”.",
            "The Tories will also “end frivolous legal challenges that frustrate infrastructure delivery by amending the law so judicial reviews that don’t have merit do not waste court time”.",
            "Delivering energy security",
            "The Tory party pledges to shore up UK energy security by legislating for annual licencing rounds for oil and gas production from the North Sea.",
            "The windfall tax on firms, introduced in 2022, will remain in place until 2028-29, “unless prices fall back to normal sooner”.",
            "A Tory government would also deliver new gas power stations “to maintain a safe and reliable energy source for days when the weather doesn’t power up renewables”.",
            "On renewables, it has pledged to treble the UK’s offshore wind capacity and build the first two carbon capture and storage clusters in north Wales and on Teesside. It would additionally provide a bonus, on top of contract payments that support offshore wind, to reward energy firms that invest in manufacturing in the most disadvantaged places in the UK or invest in more sustainable supply chains.",
            "It would invest £1.1bn into the Green Industries Growth Accelerator to support “British manufacturing capabilities, boost supply chains and ensure our energy transition is made in Britain”.",
            "Building on the establishment of Great British Nuclear, a newly elected Conservative government would approve two fleets of SMRs within its first 100 days. It says this will “rapidly expand nuclear power, create well-paid, high-skilled jobs and deliver cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy”.",
            "Additionally, the Tories would halve the time needed to approve new nuclear reactors. It wil do this by allowing regulators to assess projects while designs are being finalised, improving join-up with overseas regulators assessing the same technology and speeding up planning and environmental approvals.",
            "It has reiterated its commitment to building the next large-scale nuclear plant at Wylfa in north Wales alongside completing the delivery of Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C.",
            "Overall, these actions will “help the UK to become a net exporter of electricity” thus bringing in additional revenue according to the Tory manifesto.",
            "A new carbon pricing mechanism would be put in place by 2027 to ensure that imports of iron, steel, aluminium, ceramics and cement from countries with a lower or no carbon price will face a comparable carbon price to those goods produced in the UK.",
            "‘Pragmatic’ approach to net zero",
            "A new Conservative government would take a “pragmatic, proportionate and realistic” approach to net zero.",
            "This will include a vote in the next Parliament “on the next stage of our pathway, with adoption of any new target accompanied by proper consideration of the plans and policies required to meet the target, to maintain democratic consent for the big decisions that net zero will mean for our country”.",
            "Green levies on household bills will be lower under the Tories. The party has promised that energy bills will be lower in each year of the next Parliament than they were in 2023. There would be no further green levies, it has confirmed.",
            "It would also reform the Climate Change Committee, “giving it an explicit mandate to consider cost to households and UK energy security in its future climate advice”.",
            "The infrastructure investment pledges made in the Conservative Manifesto are a reiteration of promises made in the",
            "document released in October 2023 after the cancellation of High Speed 2 (HS2).",
            "It promises to spend £36bn of “HS2 savings” on filling potholes, delivering Northern Powerhouse Railway, a new station in Bradford, build the Midlands Rail Hub, deliver upgrades to South West railways, upgrade Ely Junction, electrify the North Wales main line, and reopen abandoned railways among other schemes.",
            "It has reiterated support for major road schemes Lower Thames Crossing and the A303 Stonehenge Tunnel.",
            "It has further promised that automated vehicles will be on the roads in the next Parliament, “thanks to our world-leading legislation”.",
            "It has also pledged support for the growth and decarbonisation of the UK’s aviation sector, with little detail other than the use of sustainable aviation fuels and investment in “future aviation technology”. “We will support domestic flights including through Public Service Obligations, protecting vital routes within the UK, including to islands and remote areas,” it states.",
            "Support will also be shown to the maritime sector and its decarbonisation and it promises to “foster our science and innovation expertise in the space industry”. There is little to no further detail on these promises.",
            "The Nuclear Industry Association chief executive Tom Greatrex said the nuclear industry “will welcome the continuing commitment to both large and small nuclear projects as an integral part of a balanced, secure and reliable power mix for the future”.",
            "He continued: “Cutting the time taken by government to approve new projects is essential to have the pace in delivery which is required for an energy secure future. Sizewell, Wylfa and other sites will play a crucial role, and see the jobs, growth and economic activity that come with new nuclear in all parts of the country.”",
            "Conversely, capaign group Stop Sizewell C reacted negatively, saying that the manifesto “overlooks the inconvenient fact that Sizewell C still hasn’t achieved a Final Investment Decision, while refusing to state both how much taxpayers’ money would be required to get it built, and how much households would have to pay during its lengthy and risky construction”.",
            "The group continued: “Ironically, given the Conservatives’ desire to halve reactor approval time, this Party seems prepared to commit billions to EDF's disastrous EPR technology, despite it being proven to be so expensive and unreliable.”"

            "“Significant construction delays are still the norm and costs have continued to climb.”",
            "It goes on to make the argument that renewables should be invested in faster, and SMRs should be left behind, to help in the transition away from fossil fuels.",
            "IEEFA director of resource planning analysis and co-author of the report David Schlissel said: “A key argument from SMR proponents is that the new reactors will be economically competitive.",

            "“Regulators, utilities, investors and government officials should acknowledge this and embrace the available reality: Renewables are the near-term solution.”",
            "Public policy monintor InfluenceWatch says that IEEFA is “heavily funded by left-of-center and/or environmentally-focused private foundations” and “has repeatedly opposed the use of nuclear energy”.",

            "earlier this year, wrote an open letter to energy secretary Claire Coutinho expressing concern",
            "about how reliant the UK’s decarbonisation strategy is on the deployment of SMRs. The EAC said that many of the advertised benefits of SMRs are either half-truths or unproven and the timescale for their deployment is likely to be longer than currently anticipated.",
            "Nuclear industry says SMRs needed ‘in the mix’",
            "Nuclear Industry Association (NIA) director of policy and external affairs Lincoln Hill said: “Nuclear provides a unique and irreplaceable contribution to our energy: the only technology that provides clean, reliable, and sovereign power all in one.",

            "“The key is to apply the lessons of civil infrastructure projects the world over: standardise designs, built in fleets, finance cheaply and keep your workforce active.",
            "“If we apply that, I’m confident SMRs will prove a vital part of our net zero transition not just to 2050, but for the rest of this century and beyond.”",

            "“Each Rolls-Royce SMR’s is manufactured as modules, tested and commissioned in a controlled factory environment before being assembled into a fully integrated power plant on site – dramatically reducing time, cost and project risk.",
            "“Each Rolls-Royce SMR project will follow a standardised design and identical assembly process; meaning follow-on projects will benefit from learning and best practice, resulting in significant cost and programme benefits.”",

            "EDF has five operational nuclear power stations in the UK, which account for roughly 15% of the UK’s electricity. Hartlepool, Heysham 1, Heysham 2 and Torness, which are Advanced Gas-cooled reactors, are reaching the end of their operational lives.",
            "However, EDF has extended Hartlepool and Heysham 1 to 2026 and Heysham 2 and Torness to 2028.",

            "Above and beyond the GBN’s current competition for the development and deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs), EDF wants the government to develop “a coherent pipeline of projects covering large scale small and advanced technologies”.",
            "This longer-term pipeline will “help to support the continued development of the supply chain that EDF has built at Hinkley Point C and support the necessary skills development” it says. It adds that it will also benefit all developers of future projects as they will have access to a stronger supply chain and skills base.",
            "It says it has already undertaken the “immense task” of relearning nuclear skills, creating a new supply chain and training a workforce – one that “others will benefit from for decades to come”.",
            "“Like other major infrastructure projects, we have found civil construction slower than we hoped and faced inflation, labour and material shortages, on top of Covid and Brexit disruption,” it adds, but “the good news is that much of that pioneering work to rebuild our industry is done”.",
            "It says that performance will improve 20-30% when it moves on to building the infrastructure for the second reactor at Hinkley Point C. This same approach will then be repeated and Sizewell C.",
            "“For example, new welding techniques mean we can now weld a metre on our steel pools in one hour instead of four,” EDF says. “Building and repeating an identical design is the key to success – the evidence is clear.”",
            "Market changes and customer relations",
            "EDF wants a fair and competitive retail market as this is “at the forefront of driving the change needed to help Britain achieve its net zero ambitions”.",
            "A long-term meaningful social tariff to make energy affordable",
            "Extra help to support customers to use less, with the government ramping up delivery of energy efficiency improvements",
            "Complete the smart meter upgrade",
            "EDF wants the government to create the best environment for renewable technologies. It would like the government to improve the Contracts for Difference process to get the volume of projects needed to support national net zero ambitions through the system",
            "A flexible grid must be developed, according to EDF. This will take unprecedented and essential grid investment, significant reform to the regulatory framework at both Ofgem and the National Energy System Operator.",
            "EDF believes the government must also enact planning reforms to support timely delivery and compensate communities that host the infrastructure.",
            "Additionally, a more strategic and coordinated approach to grid connections is needed, it says.",
            "EDF says market reform is necessary, particularly in the area of management of network congestion.",
            "“We support development of an evolutionary approach building on the existing national market framework, with reform of transmission charges and development of a constraint market,” it says. “We believe that this approach is more likely to deliver real benefits for consumers quickly and less likely to jeopardise low carbon investment than a more disruptive reform such as zonal pricing.”",
            "It wants the next government to move quickly to reach decisions, concluding the policy development of the Review of Electricity Market Arrangements process, brining clarity to the market.",
            "It believes carbon pricing will help support cost-effective decarbonisation and the next government should work with the European Union to link the UK ETS to the EU ETS to provide a more robust and stable carbon price.",
            "A reform of the planning process is critical, as the current system is “onerous”.",
            "“Currently the UK’s planning regime is neither efficient nor proportionate, and urgent reform is needed to be able to deliver the net zero infrastructure we need,” EDF says. “Government must provide clear signals of intent to provide confidence in infrastructure investment.”",
            "Specific actions recommended by EDF include resourcing of local planning authorities and environmental bodies, exploring whether public bodies need net zero mandates and ensuring National Policy Statements are clear and regularly updated.",
            "Additionally, the planning system “needs to see a change in the amount of time and number of decisions that can be subject to judicial review”, according to EDF.",
            "EDF also echoes the concerns of many about the skills necessary to enable net zero. It asks for a development of a new central skills oversight body that coordinated a cross-sectoral review of job opportunities from construction through to facilities management and nuclear operations.",
            "“Such a body would also be able to co-ordinate actions across regions and devolved governments so that interventions optimise success for employers, training providers and for trainees,” it says. “Further it could work cross-departmentally so that barriers to access are shared and removed.”",
            "EDF wants to work with government to ensure that young people know from an early stage that they can have a long-term career in the energy sector and which roles are available directly and indirectly.",
            "It continues to promote the need for a reform of the apprentice levy. “Such reform would drive resources into areas of highest economic benefit and as such we would better be able to target Level 1 and 2 pre-apprenticeship pathway programmes,” EDF says. “To equip the workforce of the future, EDF calls on government to prioritise the building of common competence pathways within the nuclear and construction sectors, refreshing occupational standards and occupational demand/heat maps.”"

            "“Plugging the site directly into our transmission network – the electricity superhighway that spans England and Wales – will deliver it a firm supply of power 24/7, and enable its operations that will support jobs and prosperity in the area for years to come.”",
            "Sunderland City Council chief executive Patrick Melia said: “The creation of Nissan’s EV36Zero Hub will create and sustain many thousands of jobs for years to come, so this is a transformation project that is powered by partnership working. We’re pleased to see this work move forward.”",
            "South Tyneside Council chief executive Janathan Tew said: “IAMP is a vitally important project which will support the growth of the UK manufacturing sector, this new grid connection will unlock enormous potential thanks to collaboration with National Grid and our colleagues at Sunderland City Council.”",
            "OTW project director Steve Galliers said: “This project is one of several that Omexom and Taylor Woodrow JV is delivering on behalf of National Grid. We are proud to be helping to build resilience in the UK’s energy provision and excited to play a part in one of the most important developments in the UK.”"

            "The UK government secretary of state for Scotland Alister Jack revealed in a House of Lords committee meeting that discussions were taking place on siting a small modular reactor (SMR) north of the border and that it is part of UK-wide plan.",

            "“I believe that in 2026 we’ll see a unionist regime again in Holyrood and they will move forward with that.”",
            "He also made reference to the shortness of the “timescales in front of us”, which could either be regarding the breadth and speed required for the energy transition or to the looming General Election.",
            "The subject was then brought up in Scottish Parliament’s first minister’s questions (FMQs) on Thursday 16 May.",
            "During FMQs, Member of Scottish Parliament Rona Mackay asked: “Despite opposition from the democratically elected Scottish government, where Scotland does not need expensive nuclear power; we already have abundant natural energy resources, can the first minister advise whether the United Kingdom government has approached Scottish ministers about those apparent plans?",
            "“Can he confirm that the Scottish government will oppose those plans and, instead, focus on Scotland’s substantial renewable energy potential?”",
            "First minister John Swinney responded to say how he was appalled no mention of the discussions had been made to the Scottish government by the secretary of state for Scotland.",

            "“I was in Ardersier on Monday and the cabinet secretary for net zero and energy was in Nigg on Tuesday to support the announcements of formidable investments in Scotland’s renewable energy potential.",
            "“Those are massive investments that will bring jobs and opportunities to the Highlands and Islands and deliver green, clean energy for the people of Scotland. That is the government’s policy agenda, and we will have nothing to do with nuclear power.”",

            "“Small modular reactors, while innovative in construction and size, still generate electricity using nuclear fission and therefore the process presents the same environmental concerns as traditional nuclear power plants.",

            "A significant uplift in workforce capacity will need to take place to deliver that ambition and the government said 50% more highly skilled workers will be needed in the next 10 years for both the nuclear weapons and civil nuclear power industries. The government said that by 2030, 123,000 people will be needed for the nuclear power targets alone.",
            "To meet this challenge, the government has said it is partnering with industry including BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, EDF and Babcock, “to invest at least £763M by 2030 in skills, jobs and education”.",
            "It said this would create “more than 8,000 career opportunities to help the sector fill 40,000 new jobs by the end of the decade” and will also support plans to double the number of nuclear apprentices and graduates and quadruple the number of people undertaking specialist science and nuclear fission PhDs.",
            "“The investment in nuclear skills,” the government said, “includes £350M from the government and more than £400M from industry”, which will “create some 5,000 new apprenticeships in the next four years.”",

            "The government is “committed to building on” its support for advanced modular reactors (AMRs), according to an energy minister in the House of Lords.",
            "Backbench Labour hereditary peer Viscount Hansworth asked the government “what assistance they provide to the developers of advanced modular reactors to enable them to conduct criticality tests” during a sitting of the House of Lords on 19 March.",
            "The government published its",
            "Civil nuclear: Roadmap to 2050 in January 2024",
            "where it set out an ambition to reach 24GW of nuclear power capacity in the UK by 2050.",
            "As part of this plan, it said “AMRs can offer decarbonisation capability beyond power provision, including high-grade steam/heat and hydrogen production. We have already committed to research and development investment to deploy an AMR High Temperature Gas Reactor demonstration unit by the early 2030s.”",
            "During the discussion on 19 March, Lord Howell of Guildford, a Conservative backbencher, quoted Great British Nuclear as saying “the final decision on smaller modular reactors will not be made until 2029 for the present competition, and that no smaller modular reactor will be in service until 2035.”",
            "Minister for Energy Efficiency and Green Finance Lord Callanan said he did not recognise the dates quoted and said in response “I understand that, given a fair wind, the reactors should be online and producing electricity by the early 2030s.”",
            "Lord Ravensdale, a crossbench hereditary peer and current project director for major nuclear clients at Atkins, asked the government about the UK’s ongoing reliance on imports of nuclear fuel from Russia. The minister said he shared the peer’s concerns and said the government would be responding to his concerns soon in writing.",
            "Across the House, peers were generally in favour of accelerated development of AMRs, apart from Green party peer Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb, who asked: “Do the Government give any assistance to these developers in terms of the environmental impact of the entire life cycle of their systems, or is that completely disregarded?”",
            "Lord Callanan responded by saying: “Of course it is not disregarded,” and said the safety of the UK’s nuclear programme is “one of our highest priorities” and said the UK has an “excellent record.”",
            "Nuclear Industry Association chief executive Tom Greatrex said: \"AMRs have really exciting potential for industrial decarbonisation, providing clean heat directly to enterprises that are otherwise stuck burning fossil fuels.",
            "“For that reason, we need to ensure the UK is the best place to develop these technologies.",
            "“We have unmatched engineering pedigree in this field, particularly high-temperature gas reactors, and we hope the Government's AMR RD&D (research, development and demonstration) programme keeps on track so it can deliver on its aim to get a demonstrator up and running in the 2030s.\"",

            "Nuclear AMRC government policy director Chris Pook said: “The level of interest in nuclear energy that is being shown by politicians of all colours is very welcome and it was good to see the tangible progress being made by the government, as Lord Callanan highlighted in his remarks.",
            "“However, there is an urgent need to invest in the development of the industrial capability required to support the deployment of advanced modular technologies, including SMRs.”",
            "Pook said the Nuclear AMRC, “was established to develop supply chain capability and help UK companies win business, but without early support from the government to identify and address bottlenecks in the supply chain we risk delaying delivery of new reactors and losing the opportunity to establish a significant position in the global nuclear renaissance.”",
            "He described the “development of centres of excellence, testing and demonstration facilities that serve all parts of the sector” as “essential.”",
            "CND vice-president Dr Ian Fairlie said: \"CND notes the Lords' debate and their uncritical ill-informed comments about small modular reactors.",
            "“The reality is that none of these mythical commercial reactors exist and indeed that the serious plans for such reactors recently failed in Idaho in the US leaving their shareholders in the lurch.",
            "“Even the government admits that any such reactors are a long way off, with none planned to operate before 2030 if at all.",
            "“CND considers that these nuclear discussions are little more than hot air by nuclear obsessives and that it would be much more realistic and productive for the government to invest more in the renewable sources of electricity generation and in their UK infrastructure.\"",
            "As part of its previous response to the civil nuclear roadmap, an ONR spokesperson said: “ONR is ready to independently regulate the country’s anticipated growing nuclear sector.",
            "“The UK has a widely respected regulatory system and ONR has been preparing for the expansion of new nuclear for some time.”",
            "The spokesperson also pointed out ONR had developed its “capability and capacity to regulate light water small modular reactors (SMRs) and the next generation of advanced modular reactors (AMRs)” and had “Advised the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero on its AMR feasibility and development programme.”"

            "\"The Welsh Affairs Committee held an inquiry into Nuclear energy in Wales last year and the evidence to the committee was clear: Wylfa is one of the best sites for nuclear development. With UK government ownership of the site, I hope that efforts can progress to allow the development of the Wylfa Newydd site to host the next nuclear power station in the UK after Sizewell C.”",
            "Nuclear Industry Association chief executive Tom Greatrex said: “This is a pivotal moment for the future of nuclear in the UK and should mark the beginning of new projects at these sites.",
            "“Wylfa is one of the very best sites for new nuclear anywhere in Europe and there is great promise for a series of SMRs at Oldbury. The success of ramping up nuclear capacity for energy security and net zero rests a great deal on whether we develop at these sites and others.",
            "“New nuclear capacity at Wylfa would transform the North Wales economy with fresh investment, thousands of good jobs, as well as providing clean, reliable and sovereign power lasting well into the next century.\"",
            "The chancellor further announced the continuation of the development of small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear technology in the UK.",
            "Six firms were shortlisted for government support to deliver a new wave of nuclear reactors in October last year.",

            "The remaining £300M was previously announced for UK production of the fuel required to power high-tech new nuclear reactors, known as High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU).",
            "Costain energy director Laura Hughes said: “The energy sector will be buoyed by news relating both to energy transition and power transmission.  Moving forward with planning and grid connection reforms is critical to the timely delivery of the required electricity network.  A consultation around a new accelerated planning service and the confirmed establishment of the new National Energy System Operator this year are key elements that will maintain momentum in the delivery of energy infrastructure.",
            "“Confirmation of further investment into supply chains for carbon capture utilisation and storage and hydrogen is also positive news. This is a measure that could help generate consistency of demand, provide investors with more assurance, and incentivise the industry to develop the engineering skills needed for the UK to remain competitive on the global stage. Improvements and upgrades to the energy infrastructure ecosystem will help with job creation and regional economic growth, fuelling a virtuous circle that goes beyond energy security.",

            "Ministers from the Scottish National Party (SNP) have slammed the UK government’s infrastructure procurement, saying there is “£100bn overspend in infrastructure projects without even digging too deeply”.",
            "SNP MP for Kilmarnock and Loudon Alan Brown brought the matter of infrastructure procurement to a House of Commons chamber adjournment debate on 19 February. Serious doubts about the government’s management of High Speed 2 (HS2) and its commitment to nuclear power formed the core of his argument.",
            "Brown started the debate by outlining “a few of the projects that UK governments have had responsibility for and failed to deliver properly, and illustrate just how much that has cost the taxpayer”. He then reeled off “£45bn on the HS2 phase 1 overspend, the £30bn overspend on Hinkley Point C, the £10bn overspend in the Shared Services network replacement, a very modest £3bn overspend in Crossrail, and a couple of billion extra spent on the Great Western electrification project”.",
            "“Therefore, very quickly, we have a £90bn overspend before we even get to the black hole that is Ministry of Defence procurement,” he added.",
            "After dissecting the issues that have arisen through the government’s procurement and management of infrastructure delivery, Brown said that the government must come up with an overarching strategy that links needs to outcomes and identifies budgets, providing contractors with a clear pipeline of work that will allow them to “gear up and plan ahead accordingly”.",
            "Brown said: “All these projects I have spoken about show that risk needs to be correctly allocated. The lessons learned means that sufficient up-front design work needs to be undertaken. We need early contractor involvement and a clear pipeline of projects. These are all matters that the construction industry has actually been calling for for years. We also need politicians to take responsibility, where required, and for politicians to understand that undue interference and the chopping and changing of projects mean an increase in costs and programme delays.",
            "“Somehow in today’s political world, we do need to have cross-party working as much as possible. One thing is for sure: we cannot continue to have flagship projects that are handled as badly as HS2, Hinkley and the rest. It is quite clear that some politicians down here [in Westminster] really do need to look in before they look out when it comes to infrastructure delivery.”",
            "The government’s response came from Cabinet Office parliamentary undersecretary Alex Burghart, who proclaimed the value of",
            "the recently published National Infrastructure and Construction Pipeline",
            ". He said this reflects the government’s “commitment to economic growth and productivity” and “is going to provide great certainty to the industry”.",
            "Burghart added that the new Procurement Act 2023 “will create a simpler and more transparent system that delivers better value for money and reduces costs for business and the public sectors, and learns the lessons of recent years”. Further, he promoted the",
            "for setting out “how contracting authorities can now ensure that this ambitious programme of public investment is delivered in a way that maximises value for money”.",
            "Burghart continued: “One in every £3 of public money—some £300bn a year—is spent on public procurement. By improving the way public procurement is regulated, the government will save the taxpayer money and drive benefits across every region of our country.",
            "“Following the UK’s exit from the EU, we have seized the opportunity to develop and implement a new procurement regime in a way that simply was not possible while we were members of the EU. The Act helps deliver the prime minister’s promise to grow the economy by creating a simpler and more transparent system that will deliver better value for money and reduce costs to businesses and the public sector. Crucially, it will provide new opportunities to small and medium-sized enterprises to get a bigger share of that £300bn a year prize, a great achievement.”",
            "Brown and fellow SNP ministers Dave Doogan and Gavin Newlands, who were also in attendance, remained unconvinced by these claims.",
            "Issues with HS2 procurement",
            "Much of Brown’s speech focused on HS2. He commented on how the “the original business case and proposals were for it to extend to Scotland to help with a modal shift away from flying”. He added that it was also to improve business productivity by allowing a quicker connection between Scotland and London.",
            "He went on to say that the argument for HS2 changed to be about freeing up capacity on existing lines, particularly the West Coast Main Line. While Brown said that this was fine in principle and good for decarbonisation but added: “what the different arguments and analysis mean is that there was never an established rationale for the key outcomes for HS2”.",
            "“That has made it easier, as part of the inherent north-south bias of a London government, to make phase 1 of the project the London to Birmingham link, and to make that the most important aspect,” he added.",
            "Doogan, who is SNP MP for Angus, interjected to say that, despite HS2 being promoted as a project that would connect the length of Great Britain, “we knew we were getting nothing out of it in Scotland”. He added that his constituents are footing £92M of the HS2 bill, when it would be better spent on a link to Laurencekirk, fixing erosion on the Montrose Links or better flood defences in Brechin.",
            "Brown then returned to his speech and tore into the decision by the Department for Transport and HS2 Ltd to procure “the quickest high-speed trains” which, once they reach the standard railway north of Birmingham, will actually run slower than existing Avanti West Coast services.",
            "“Not only will we not get high-speed rail to Scotland, we will get a poorer service from the new high-speed rail once it is running on the West Coast Main Line,” he said. “How can that be a logical proposal for the most expensive infrastructure project ever undertaken by a UK government?”",
            "Brown then outlined the step-by-step dismantling of the HS2 network: the successive removals of the eastern leg to Leeds, the Golborne link to connect it to the WCML, the western leg to Manchester and the southern terminus at Euston.",
            "“Clearly, there is no overall strategic thinking other than a continual form of panicked cost control,” he said. “Unfortunately, HS2 is a monument to a poorly developed concept of not knowing what the key strategic objectives would be, unrealistic budgets, politicians meddling in route alignment and increasing the amount of tunnelling, politician panic as costs increase, continual stop-start reviews all costing money, over-specification, unrealistic risk allocation, and clearly not enough up-front design and site investigation work or proper planning with regard to project delivery and discussions with contractors.”",
            "Hinkley Point C and nuclear woes",
            "Brown then moved on to “another major infrastructure project that is very similar in its overspend, delays and costs spiralling out of control: Hinkley Point C nuclear power station”.",
            "the January update from EDF Energy",
            "in which it revealed that the cost estimate has hit £46bn in today’s prices, adding “by last week, it had already increased to £48bn”.",
            "“That is a mere £30bn overspend on what was already the world’s most expensive power station,” he continued. “Instead of generating power in 2025, it will now be as late as 2031. As costs have continued to spiral, the government’s attitude is, ‘It’s okay, the risk lies entirely with EDF,’ which is completely head-in-the-sand stuff.”",
            "Brown mentioned that EDF’s partner China General Nuclear has refused to put any more capital into the project and therefore “clearly EDF is having to fund a lot more borrowing”. He said it “beggars belief” that the government is not engaging EDF on this issue, especially as the energy company’s chief executive Luc Rémont said last week that he is confident that there will be a “a pathway with British authorities on Hinkley Point C and Sizewell”.",
            "“In other words, there will be another taxpayer bailout,” Brown said.",
            "Brown then lambasted the government for “diving head first” into the regulated asset base (RAB) model for funding the construction of the next planned large-scale nuclear power station, Sizewell C.",
            "The RAB model sees private investors pay a large upfront contribution that is recouped through a surcharge on taxes, with the amount being set by an independent regulator, in this case Ofgem.",
            "Brown cited the case of a nuclear power station in South Carolina which was paid for through RAB, but was abandoned midway – yet billpayers are still paying an increased rate to make up for the private investment that was sunk into it.",
            "“How will the UK Government make sure that this does not happen at Sizewell?”, he questioned.",
            "The Citizens Advice Bureau has also expressed concerns about the RAB model for funding Sizewell C, saying that it will likely “offer consumers poor value for money even if it is cheaply financed”.",
            "Doogan then interjected to say that HM Treasury seems to have no concern for nuclear overspends.",
            "“When it comes to nuclear, regardless of whether it is civil or military, there is no shortage of UK government funding,” Doogan said. “Yet all across GB there are plans for massive pylon lines going through communities. The pylon lines could be offshored but have to be done at the lowest possible cost, which means overhead lines.",
            "“There is no parity between nuclear and anything else. Everything else is bargain-basement, Treasury Green Book ‘let’s screw the contractor down to the very lowest price’, except for nuclear.”",
            "Brown agreed and added that the government is “kidding itself” about nuclear and is still claiming that Sizewell C will cost £20bn.",
            "“We already know that Hinkley, which is the model for Sizewell C, is costing nearly £50bn, so why pretend that it will cost only £20bn?” he said. “They are setting their stall out wrongly and have a blinkered approach that suggests we somehow need nuclear, when clearly we do not actually need it.",
            "“What they should be investing in is renewable energy, storage systems and [...] much better grid infrastructure as well.”",
            "Brown then turned his attention to small modular reactors (SMRs), the small-scale nuclear plants that government is aiming to deploy in numbers to help decarbonise the electricity system.",
            "He said that this needs to be reconsidered, echoing the",
            "doubts recently cast by the Environmental Audit Committee",
            "about the potential for SMRs to aid in the decarbonisation of the grid.",
            "“First, they are not small, and no proven design is operational anywhere in the world, but it seems that the British exceptionalism that the government believes in means that Britain will somehow lead the way in all sorts of nuclear power generation,” he said.",
            "He cited NuScale, the American power corporation that was to be the first to deploy SMR technology, which has recently abandoned its maiden Utah power station after costs ballooned to over £7bn.",
            "“The government, true to form, believes that it will be able to deliver SMRs for about £2bn a go,” Brown said. “That defies all logic and inevitably means yet more future infrastructure delays and overspend.”",
            "Brown then contrasted the Westminster government’s infrastructure delivery struggles with some success stories in Scotland.",
            "“It is worth highlighting that the Scottish Government have delivered the longest stretch of new railway since Victorian times with the reopening of the Borders railway in 2015,” he said. “That is a real success story—one that the Tories said would never happen. Is it ever praised or used by the Tories as a good example? No. Instead, their immediate messaging is about the need to extend the railway further, an aspiration that the Scottish Government shares.",
            "“It seems to me that, at some point, politicians must be gracious about successful projects, and take learning from them for other projects.”",
            "Brown also commented on the successful delivery of rail electrification north of the border.",
            "“Scotland has always had a clear and steady programme, unlike the continual chopping and changing of programmes in England,” he said. “It generates contractor expertise and a steady supply chain, and contractors are confident that there will be a future pipeline of work. The cost of delivering electrification in Scotland is £2M per km, compared with £3M per km in England, so the UK government’s procurement rate is 50% higher than that of the Scottish Government.”",
            "Brown then said that the Scottish Government would be better off if it were independent and able to control its own infrastructure procurement and delivery.",
            "“A proper budget-setting process should mean looking at needs, and then deciding what funding is required to suit those needs and what the aspirations are,” he said. “Instead, at every Budget, we are supposed to doff our cap and be grateful that increased spend in England gives some crumbs to Scotland. That is not proper planning.",
            "“Again, an independent country that had proper borrowing powers would be able to plan strategically for the future, instead of this haphazard measure that is reliant on the Barnett formula.”",
            "He continued: “It goes back to the fact that an independent country making its own decisions would plan strategically and be able to borrow money accordingly. Quite often, borrowing for infrastructure leads to the kind of circular reinvestment in job creation that is a win-win.",
            "“If we look at roads, we see that it was the SNP that finally delivered a continuous motorway between Edinburgh and Glasgow. The M74 and the M80 have been completed, as has the Queensferry crossing.",
            "“Yes, if we listen to the headlines, the A9 has clearly been delayed: a much more realistic programme for the A9 should have been developed before now, and Transport Scotland should also have heeded industry concerns about its bespoke contract models making it difficult for contractors to bid.",
            "“However, the reality is that the SNP Government has delivered on a limited budget, and while the Tories demand more and more, they are also content with the capital allocation being cut over the next two years.”"

            "The Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) has cast doubt over the government's reliance on small modular reactors (SMRs) in the phasing out of fossil fuels from the UK's energy system by 2035.",
            "EAC chair Phillip Dunne has expressed his doubts in an open letter to energy secretary Claire Coutinho following the EAC’s inquiry into the introduction of SMR technology to the UK power network in the lead up to net zero.",
            "In January, the government released a roadmap to enact the biggest expansion of nuclear power in the UK for 70 years, hoping to increase nuclear generation to 24GW by 2050",
            ". The deployment of SMRs is crucial to achieving this goal and the government's new nuclear body Great British Nuclear (GBN) is currently running a competition for the best SMR design. The winner will receive government contracts to be taken forward, though other designs can still be deployed via other means.",
            "six SMR designs currently being considered in the UK",
            ", each at various stages of assessment by the Office for Nuclear Regulation.",
            "However, the EAC is sceptical about this reliance on SMRs. Dunne’s letter reads: “It seems unlikely that the reactor will be contributing generating capacity to the grid until 2035, which is the date by when the government expects the UK electricity grid to have been decarbonised.",
            "“The overall role of SMRs in replacing fossil fuel generation by 2035 is therefore called into question.",
            "“While SMRs are said to benefit overall energy security, since they will be able to provide electricity during periods when renewables are not generating power, concerns have been raised about the relative flexibility or otherwise of nuclear power generation and its place in a more agile energy system powered by renewables.”",
            "The EAC further called into question the government’s plan to proceed with using SMR technology to produce energy without developing prototype SMRs.",
            "Dunne’s letter says: “SMRs, by the UK’s definition, utilise existing nuclear fission technology but have a lower power output than conventional nuclear reactors.",
            "“Given that SMRs are based on technologies which we were assured is well-established, we were told that prototype SMRs are considered unnecessary, allowing quicker deployment of generating capacity.",
            "“However, in some of the written evidence the committee received, concerns were raised that ‘no commercial order for an SMR design has yet been placed worldwide’, raising questions about the commercial feasibility of this plan.”",
            "As well as other points raised, the EAC’s inquiry also probed GBN’s belief that the modular aspect of constructing SMRs would make up for lost economies of scale.",
            "The letter said: “We note from the evidence we received that, despite claims that the modularity of SMRs would make up for lost economies of scale, these claims will not be able to be substantiated until production begins.",
            "“Industry stakeholders observed that consistency of build tended to increase the efficiency of construction and therefore tended to decrease construction costs. Stakeholders observed that while the costs of building first-of-a-kind SMRs may be high, these costs would likely to decrease by as much as 40% as more units are built and the benefits of learning and standardisation were realised.",
            "“However, we received written evidence observing that mass production raised challenges for project management and quality control, and that major civil engineering operations would be needed for site works, suggesting that overall cost reductions might not be so significant.”",
            "Dunne said in a separate statement: “As a result of the UK’s push towards nuclear SMR technology, the UK has the opportunity to be a genuine world leader in the manufacture of SMR nuclear capability with great export potential.",
            "“However, despite pledging hundreds of millions of pounds in support for SMR projects and undertaking to invest in the construction of the UK’s first SMR, the government’s overall vision for the sector at this stage lacks clarity: Ministers might commission as much as 24GW in nuclear capacity by 2050, but could commission as little as 12GW.",
            "“The first SMR is unlikely to be in operation by 2035, the date ministers have set for decarbonising the electricity supply: so what role will SMRs have in an energy mix dominated by renewables and supplemented by existing and emerging large-scale nuclear?",
            "“This uncertainty risks knock-on effects for industry confidence: not only for investment decisions relating to the initial build and the construction of factories to build reactor modules, but also for the support and growth of supply chains and skills. We simply don’t yet know how much SMRs will contribute to electricity generation in the country, nor how much the roll-out is likely to cost the taxpayer.",
            "“The committee has therefore written to the secretary of state for energy security and net zero to seek clarity on a number of points relating to the government’s policy on SMRs. I look forward to receiving her response.”",
            "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “The Nuclear Roadmap clearly sets out how we’re backing both small modular reactors and large-scale nuclear as part of the biggest expansion in 70 years, to help ensure up to a quarter of all UK power is generated from nuclear by 2050.",
            "“Our world leading SMR competition aims to be the fastest of its kind, helping secure billions in investment for the UK, and delivering cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy for families and businesses.",
            "“We are consulting on alternative routes to market for private sector projects and our plans will always be underpinned by robust value for money assessments.”",

To put it simply, it will be almost impossible for the industry sector to reach net zero without finding solutions to assist in its decarbonisation. Nuclear may offer the solution – but only once small reactors are commercialised.",
            "Andrew McDougall KC is partner at White & Case",
            "Nuclear solutions to decarbonisation",
            "Responding to growing demand from countries looking to achieve their Paris Agreement commitments “to limit global temperature 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels”, several different types of nuclear reactors have been developed.",
            "Large nuclear power plants, for example, are being considered by states to contribute to electricity security and complement renewables. In contrast, small modular reactors (“SMRs”) have been developed mainly for off-grid purposes, and some have been specifically developed to decarbonise the industry.",

            "The advantages for an industrial site to be powered or receive heat from an SMR are several. Firstly, an SMR can improve the footprint of an industrial site as nuclear is a low-carbon energy. What’s more, nuclear energy is reliable and not intermittent; and with stable production costs, it will ensure a stable energy price.",
            "Given the size and the new construction approach, the construction phase should be dramatically shorter than for a large nuclear power plant. Even for the largest SMRs, construction is expected to last five years at most, providing the vendor with more agility when it comes to time and budget. Most of all, SMRs provide the end-user with a long-term security of supply.",
            "Ximena Vásquez-Maignan is counsel at White & Case",
            "In fact, there are already several companies from different industries that have started discussions with the nuclear sector about the possibility of using these new types of reactors. Dow Inc. plans to replace gas-fired combustion and steam engines with an SMR; and Canada’s Belledune Port Authority is pursuing the use of SMR technology as part of a future expansion to generate heat and power for industrial users at the port's recently announced Green Energy Hub.",
            "There are several considerations when it comes to the commercialisation of small reactors. For instance, in order to be commercialised, SMRs need to be licensed by the nuclear safety authorities of the countries where they will be deployed. Secondly, in order for vendors to be able to produce SMRs in series – which will allow their costs to be lower – there has to be significant interest.",
            "Only a few SMRs have been authorised to date and vendors are trying to reach out to the different industrial organisations to ensure that a critical number of SMRs are secured before starting their production. It is expected that the deployment of such reactors will start at the earliest in 2030, but most certainly at the end of that decade.",
            "However, these innovative technologies also entail innovative regulatory approaches and financing schemes – potentially setting up the runway for accelerated commercialisation.",
            "Nuclear power is extremely regulated, and an important number of legal requirements will need to be assessed and adapted in light of the risks involved with regard to SMRs. That being said, these risks should be lower than for large nuclear power plants. The fact that the SMRs will need to be located near industrial sites also raises the question of complying with the regulations and safety requirements applicable to the relevant industry.",
            "The project will also need to be structured depending on the involvement the end-energy user will want to have. There is a variety of structures that can be considered depending on who will be the owner and who will be the operator of the reactor. The end-energy user itself could be both (some may consider setting up their own nuclear operator to operate the SMRs for their industrial sites worldwide); it could delegate the operation of the SMR to the vendor or a specialised company; or it could just buy the electricity or heat in a similar approach to merchant power plants.",
            "Finally, SMRs are expected to cost less than large nuclear power plants, which should allow industrial groups to consider this alternative. Notably, SMRs and advanced nuclear reactors have been included in a number of taxonomies, which should attract commercial banks. The financing scheme will undoubtedly be very different from the one used until now for large nuclear power plants, which are mostly financed with public funds.",
            "It’s safe to say that nuclear will be part of the solution to decarbonize the industry sector and that SMRs’ distinct scope to drive this transition should be recognised.",
            "Admittedly, however, each project will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, as the nuclear technology and the industrial activity for which it will provide energy, as well as the approach that the energy end-user will have to develop the project, will differ and will bring specific benefits and challenges.",

            "US nuclear energy venture Westinghouse Electric Company has joined forces with Cumbria based venture Community Nuclear Power (CNP) to deploy four Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) in North Teesside.",
            "The agreement announced 8 February “marks a first step in the private delivery of advanced, proven SMR technology to the UK,” Westinghouse said in a statement. “It is a significant step in making this new energy sector a reality with commercial operation expected by the early 2030s.”",
            "The alliance with CNP, a Cockermouth-based consultancy, will see  four Westinghouse AP300 SMRs in North Teesside where economic growth is driving demand for carbon-free, reliable electricity. CNP is working with strategic partners including Jacobs and financial consultancy Interpath Advisory to develop a site for the project by 2027. The project is being privately funded.",
            "The four SMRs will follow Westinghouse’s AP300 model, released last May.  The AP300 SMR, 300MWe (990MWth), is based on \"proven\" technology used in the larger Generation III+ reactor already in operation globally, the  AP1000. Westinghouse says the AP1000 reactor “represents the most advanced technology available today, able to supply over 1 GW of electricity to centralised power grids. It features simplified plant design, with key features including fewer safety-related valves, less safety-related piping, less control cable, fewer pumps and less seismic building volume.",
            "The AP300 SMR was selected by Great British Nuclear (GBN) last October for the next phase of its competitive technology selection process, in line with the government’s plans to deliver a pipeline of nuclear energy projects beyond Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C. North Teesside plans to deploy the SMRs also come amid the government’s ‘Alternative Routes to Market for New Nuclear Projects’ consultation which runs until 4 April and the",
            "publication of the government Civil Nuclear Roadmap in January",
            ", which sets out its “vision for a dynamic civil nuclear sector, supporting the ambition to achieve net zero by 2050.”",
            "For scale: Westinghouse AP300 small modular reactor in a stadium",
            "On the Alternative Routes to Market for New Nuclear Projects’ consultation, minister for nuclear and renewables Andrew Bowie said:",
            "“The UK’s energy market has reached a critical juncture. We need a stronger, more reliable supply to meet increasing demand – one which doesn’t leave us dependent on foreign energy imports. But we also know how important it is to reduce carbon emissions and maintain our status as a world leader in the fight against climate change.",
            "“Nuclear power, as one of the most reliable, secure, low-carbon sources of home-produced energy, is a solution to both challenges. And that is why this government is making nuclear a central pillar of our future energy mix, with ambitions to deliver up to 24GW of capacity by 2050 – enough to meet around a quarter of the country’s projected demand.”",
            "On the North Teesside development, CNP CEO Paul Foster said: “This project brings together Westinghouse’s proven technology and mature supply chain with our depth of expertise in nuclear programme delivery, in a region that is transforming its industrial landscape. We are delighted to be working with Westinghouse in support of private deployment in North Teesside”.",
            "Westinghouse president, energy systems David Durham said: “We want to thank Community Nuclear Power for this tremendous opportunity to deliver our advanced, proven AP300 SMR technology to the UK market.",
            "“Our AP300 SMR is ideally suited not just to support grid generation, but also for industrial sites for generating clean and secure energy and the ability to produce hydrogen, e-fuels, desalination and district heating.”",
            "Westinghouse said that: “Unlike every other SMR under development with first-of-a-kind technologies and risks, Westinghouse’s AP300 SMR utilises the AP1000 engineering, components, and supply chain, enabling streamlined licensing and leveraging available technical skills. Together, these factors provide confidence that the first operating unit will be available in the early 2030s.",
            "“The advantageous economics of the AP300 SMR are based on robust analysis and existing project costs from AP1000 reactors already in operation or development.”",
            "SMR deployment is seen as desirable as it is more flexible than that of legacy reactors",
            ". Large nuclear power plants in the US have an 800km",
            "emergency planning zone (approximately the size of San Diego) and SMR developers argue that their safety zones will be equal to that of the site boundaries.",
            "SMRs also enable off-grid deployments for uses such as on-site power generation for industry and manufacturing."

            "Separate to the GDA process, Holtec Britain has also entered Great British Nuclear's SMR competition. The winner is to be announced next year and will see the government support the technology for deployment. Holtec says that if it is the winner it is planning to locate a factory to build the major mechanical SMR components and other aligned areas of business (clean energy and defense) to support deployment of more than 5GW of on-grid UK electricity by 2050.",
            "SMRs are nuclear fission reactors designed to be built at a smaller size, but in larger numbers than the world’s current nuclear fleet. They are cost competitive and considered to be more versatile, scalable, sustainable, financeable, and efficient. With wider-ranging applications such as generation of industrial heat and hydrogen production, they are well placed to help the UK government achieve its ambition of generating 24GWe of nuclear capacity by 2050.",
            "Commenting on the appointment, Mott MacDonald Nuclear technical excellence lead Ming Tan said: “Mott MacDonald has a proven history of successfully delivering major nuclear projects in the UK for over 50 years. We are confident that the technical excellence and experience of our engineers and scientists will guide Holtec through a successful GDA, ensuring this Small Modular Reactor technology can help deliver a more secure and lower carbon energy future for the UK population.”",
            "Holtec Britain director Gareth Thomas said: “We are pleased to have started GDA after planning the project for over 18 months, and are now building a large team of qualified engineers based out of our new office in Bristol, UK. In parallel we are advancing project delivery plans with our Global Team, unrivalled in nuclear power plant deployment experience.”",
            "UK minister for Nuclear Andrew Bowie said: “As the Government that revitalized the UK nuclear industry, committing public funds to nuclear for the first time in a generation, we’re rapidly expanding our nuclear power capacity to move towards a cleaner energy mix and help deliver net zero. Today’s news represents a multi-million investment to develop cutting-edge technology which could transform how power stations are built by making construction faster and cheaper.”"

            "The government must ensure that future nuclear developments utilise British supply chains and commit to building the next large-scale nuclear plant at Wylfa, the Nuclear Energy All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) has urged.",
            "These are two of several recommendations that the APPG group has made to the government and its new public body Great British Nuclear (GBN) via its new report",
            "Made In Britain: The Pathway to a Nuclear Renaissance",
            ". These steps will ensure that the UK achieves its goal of 24GW of nuclear power and “breathe new life into Britain’s industrial heartlands” according to the report.",
            "The APPG’s five over-arching recommendations for GBN are in",
            "and further details are outlined below.",
            "Establish a net zero duty on the Planning Inspectorate and all relevant regulators and designate nuclear deployment as a Critical National Priority to ensure that planning decisions reflect the urgency of our clean energy needs",
            "The APPG says that there need to be measures to ensure that the Planning Inspectorate’s regulation is “proportionate to the urgent need for more clean energy to fight climate change”.",
            "It says that the Planning Inspectorate “must be instructed explicitly to make more sensible and proportionate decisions from the start”. The APPG cites the Planning Inspectorate’s recommendations against developing Wylfa Newydd and Sizewell C on “minor environmental grounds” while simultaneously acknowledging their value to the country’s clean power needs as evidence that it does not act sensibly.",
            "It further recommends that regulatory bodies involved in the planning, permitting, licencing and consenting of new nuclear projects be properly resourced to enable timely and proportionate decisions.",
            "National Policy Statements related to nuclear power developments must be updated and adopted rapidly, the APPG adds.",
            "The APPG says that dozens of small modular reactors (SMRs) will be needed to support decarbonisation so these steps must be taken to ensure rapid deployment is possible.",
            "Publish a Nuclear Roadmap this year that outlines a full programme of projects to 2050 to enable national nuclear workforce planning and maximum UK content in future nuclear projects",
            "The government recently promised that, by the end of 2023, it will release a “practical” road map for achieving 24GW of nuclear energy.",
            "The APPG says that this road map must be “detailed” as “we can only attract investment, attract new people and build new capabilities in nuclear if we have new projects”.",
            "Commenting on current plans, the report says that the government’s pledge to reach final investment decision (FID) for Sizewell C in this Parliament and for two other as-yet-unknown projects to reach FID in the next Parliament (2024-2029) would, at best, “leave us 21 years, 12GW and billions of pounds short of our ambition”.",
            "Therefore the road map must support lifetime extensions for the existing nuclear fleet; set out the sites on which new stations can be built and how much capacity they will each have; set targets for how many projects will reach FID in each Parliament to 2050; establish the preferred funding model for these projects; and publish a standard structure for funding large scale nuclear projects.",
            "Commit the funding to GBN necessary to build its developer capabilities and to invest directly in at least the first two small modular reactor (SMR) projects and next large-scale project",
            "The APPG believes that there needs to be more clarity over GBN’s remit. It would like to know if GBN will own nuclear sites, whether it will be responsible for planning or other consents, whether it will hold nuclear site licences and if it will operate the reactors once complete.",
            "It also asserts that the government should commit to GBN having resources to take equity shares in SMR and GW scale projects as required. Further, the regulated asset base (RAB) model combined with direct public sector equity investment should be established as the government’s preferred funding model for future projects.",
            "Select a partner for the next large-scale nuclear project beyond Sizewell C in this Parliament",
            "The APPG points out that many Western large-scale reactor designs are now running and their supply chains active. It believes “the UK should seize this opportunity to start a negotiated process to determine which reactor technology is best placed to deliver a further large-scale project at Wylfa, while maximising British supply chain expertise”.",
            "It says that Wylfa is the best site in Europe for a large-scale nuclear plant and “thus ideal for realising the fleet effect of multi-unit replication”.",
            "It believes the government should therefore purchase the Wylfa land and IP of Horizontal Nuclear Power from Hitachi. It should then give the development access to the RAB funding model and put in a government “cornerstone” equity stake to increase investor confidence. It should also support GBN in securing planning consent and expedite site licencing.",
            "It believes that a partner to bring the project to fruition must be chosen by the end of this Parliament.",
            "Award funding and assign sites to SMR Technology Partners by March 2024",
            "The APPG believes that the UK can establish market leadership on SMRs and this should start with GBN selecting its preferred technologies and locations by March 2024. It believes there should be multiple locations for multiple technologies.",
            "It adds that by ordering a fleet of SMRs, the UK will “justify investment in SMR factories from the selected vendor, increasing the efficiency of construction and building up UK industrial capabilities”.",
            "The APPG says the government should offer the prospect of further SMR orders if the initial ones work out as successful. It adds that sites already established as suitable for SMRs should be made immediately available to vendors.",
            "Overarching this, the government must invest in the capacity of the UK supply chain to serve domestic and foreign SMR orders, the APPG believes.",
            "It adds: “The UK government should focus on reinstating the UK’s capability to manufacture components for SMRs such as reactor pressure vessels, steam generators and turbines. This will stimulate economic growth and bring high-value jobs to local communities.”",
            "It believes that SMRs “present an enormous export opportunity” and that the Rolls-Royce SMR design is a “strong option for driving UK reactor exports”.",
            "It urges the government to “develop UK manufacturing capabilities to build whatever designs are chosen, UK or foreign”.",
            "It adds: “That way, the UK supply chain can not only provide UK content for UK projects, but also potentially win orders for SMR projects globally […] we are firmly convinced that this ‘high-value’ approach to SMR deployment should be our goal.”"

            "This major SITC report called for more transparency regarding the planned strategies to meet the nuclear targets as the UK eyes net zero by 2050 as well.",
            "The SITC’s report also highlighted the UK’s chequered history of scaling up nuclear capacity, stating it has been a number of decades since a nuclear reactor was constructed.",
            "The £33bn GBN-backed under-construction Hinckley Point C power station is currently underway and is due to finish constructing its first reactor at some point this year.",
            "As part of its response to the SITC’s report, the government said: “[The government] has committed to achieving two Final Investment Decisions in the next parliament, at least one of which will be for small modular reactors (SMRs).",
            "“Achieving the UK civil nuclear programme means building a pipeline across the full spectrum of nuclear technologies, including large-scale, SMRs and advanced modular reactor technologies.",
            "“We will support at scale the development of SMR technology as well as the design, engineering and supporting infrastructure to ensure that we can deliver on our ambition for operational plants in the mid-2030s.”",
            "A number of questions are asked of the proposal to build the Sizewell C nuclear power plant, a planned dual reactor 3.26GW capacity nuclear plant on the Suffolk coast that is projected to cost £20bn and take between 13 and 17 years to construct, though estimates of cost and timescale vary.",
            "The government responded by stating: “With regard to Sizewell C, subject to project development and the timing of any positive final investment decision, we expect the project to be generating power by the mid-2030s.",
            "“We will set out further detail on future plans in the roadmap published later this year.”",
            "the process of finding private investors to help fund the construction of the power plant commenced.",
            "The project will be funded through a regulated asset base (RAB) model, like those used on Tideway and Heathrow Terminal 5. This sees the investors pay a large upfront contribution that is recouped through a surcharge on taxes, with the amount being set by an independent regulator, in this case Ofgem. While it means a small increase in taxes, the government estimates it will save consumers at least £30bn on the project.",
            "The RAB model means the risk is shared between investors and taxpayers and in theory incentivises the investors to push the project through to completion on schedule.",
            "However, the RAB model has never been used on a nuclear project and researchers at the University of Greenwich School of Business believe that taxpayers’ contribution to the plant could be double what the government projects.",
            "The SITC’s report highlighted these worries to which the government responded: “In establishing use of the RAB model for use on nuclear projects, the government followed the recommendation of the National Audit Office that such a model could represent better value for money to consumers than the Contract for Difference model used at Hinkley Point C, by reducing the cost of project finance, the biggest driver of new nuclear project costs.",
            "“[It] requires the secretary of state to take the interests of existing and future consumers (including in terms of cost and security of supply) into account when implementing a RAB model for a designated project.”",
            "The government further stated it was developing a new nuclear National Policy Statement (NPS) to cover the deployment of new nuclear power stations beyond 2025.",
            "It said: “This new NPS will take into account the changes in the nuclear landscape since the current NPS was published in 2011, including the realistic potential for deployment of advanced nuclear technologies such as SMRs.",
            "“We are intending to consult later this year on the future siting strategy. In addition, GBN will work with wider government on access to potential sites for new nuclear projects to achieve our long-term ambition.”",
            "The SITC report also highlighted the fact that nearly all current nuclear capacity is due to expire in 2028 as all reactors, barring Sizewell B, are due to reach the end of their operational lifespans.",
            "The government responded and said: “[The government] welcomed the recent announcement by EDF that two key stations, Heysham 1 and Hartlepool, with a combined capacity of 2.4GW, will continue to operate until March 2026, an extension of two years.",
            "“The continued operation of assets in the nuclear fleet (including the AGR fleet and Sizewell B) is supportive of [the government’s’ ambitions] to deploy up to 24GW by 2050 however, lifetime extensions are a decision for the operator, EDF, and the independent nuclear regulator, Office for Nuclear Regulation, based on safety and commercial considerations.”",

            "One reactor will be located in Ohio and the other in Pennsylvania, to provide 2GW of clean energy for Standard Power's new data centres. The reactors are scheduled to be operational by 2029. NuScale said in a statement that the development of a commercial SMR power facility is a crucial step in the transition to a sustainable energy future. It will help technology data centres achieve carbon reduction targets, and support the development of a new clean energy source to meet energy transition needs.",
            "As the technology provider, NuScale will provide its proprietary SMR Technology for the projects, the only SMR technology that has received design approval from nuclear regulator the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.",
            "The designs for the SMR reactors allow them to be fully factory-fabricated with no in-field construction and operate with conventional nuclear fuel. The fabrication method reduces costs and according to NuScale provides a predictable and “consistent” cost for build and maintenance.",
            "NuScale will utilise its partnership, formed in 2022, with energy company Entra1 Energy to commercialise its NuScale SMR Technology.",
            "NuScale president and chief executive officer John Hopkins said: “NuScale is excited to work with our strategic partner Entra1 to help deliver our cost-competitive and safe SMR technology to meet Standard Power’s carbon-free energy needs.”",

            "However, as the world struggles with the immense challenges of transitioning away from fossil fuels, a resurgence of interest has appeared across the globe.",
            "Originally, nuclear energy was seen as cheap, “clean,” and stable. However, disasters such as Three-Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima understandably led governments and the public to reconsider. The serious consequences of these accidents led to rapid decisions to decommission nuclear programs before their expected lifespan. Anti-nuclear sentiment led to a decline in nuclear’s share of global energy production, from 17% in the mid-1990s to approximately 10% today.",
            "In addition to this, in recent years the nuclear industry has been associated with difficult issues regarding waste disposal, security threats arising from nuclear energy as a potential target for terrorist attacks, and, most visibly, huge cost overruns and significant delays. Some observers have concluded that the safety and economic risks of large-scale nuclear power generation are simply too great to take on.",
            "The current attraction of SMRs",
            "Small reactors date back to the early years of the nuclear power industry. Built in the USSR, the US, and Europe during the 1950s to 1970s, these early small reactors were originally used for military purposes in submarines and aircraft carriers.",
            "Small reactors generally suffer from poor economies of scale versus large nuclear power plants, which are generally at least 700MW – enough to power a city the size of Madrid.",
            "However, SMRs can circumvent the economic disadvantages by utilizing modularity to reduce capital investment. Furthermore, streamlined production and certification in factory environments can significantly reduce construction and deployment timelines.",
            "SMR deployment is significantly more flexible than that of legacy reactors. Large nuclear power plants in the US have an 800km",
            "emergency planning zone (approximately the size of San Diego) and SMR developers argue that their safety zones will be equal to that of the site boundaries. Additionally, the small capacity of SMRs facilitates off-grid deployments, which unlocks new use cases, such as on-site power generation for industry.",
            "From an investor perspective, SMRs have substantially lower upfront investment requirements, which opens a new proposition for nuclear energy for smaller investors. This increases the total capital pool for nuclear, putting less strain on local governments and municipalities, and increasing adoption further. Additionally, lower project complexity and shorter deployment timelines can alleviate cost and schedule risks of nuclear new-build projects.",
            "Why SMRs are a hot topic now",
            "As nations around the world are realising the need for reduced dependency on energy imports in order to hedge against sudden supply shocks, nuclear energy is starting to become more attractive as a potential alternative. The energy density of nuclear fuel is far superior to that of other sources, with one uranium fuel pellet (the size of a fingertip) containing as much energy as 900kg of coal, 564l of oil or 4,800m",
            "of natural gas. For a 1,000MWe nuclear power plant, daily consumption of fuel is just over 3kgs. In comparison, a coal-fired power plant with similar capacity burns around 9,000t per day.",
            "As nuclear becomes somewhat more palatable for a public faced with increasing energy prices and governments looking to secure energy autonomy, SMRs are increasingly being considered as an attractive alternative over traditional nuclear, either in themselves or as a bridge towards the next generation of nuclear reactors.",
            "The SMR space is crowded with more than 80 different technologies under development, each with its own unique features. As the industry evolves, a large number of these technologies will fail, and a few leaders will prevail. Some common characteristics are associated with success, including governmental support, first-mover advantages, traditional rather than experimental technologies, vendor robustness, and supply chain robustness.",
            "The importance of building the ecosystem",
            "To enable SMRs to overcome development challenges and fulfill their potential in the energy transition, creating the right environment is crucial. In the 20th century, the nuclear industry thrived on standardisation and regulation. However, today’s workforce lacks the necessary experience and existing regulations focus on large-scale plants.",
            "To ensure a safe and publicly acceptable SMR-based nuclear energy solution, a new ecosystem with a supply chain, developers, operators, and maintenance providers has to be created, alongside a regulatory environment that is fit for purpose. The industry and regulators must first collaborate to establish standards and enable technology benefits. Then they must identify and address the critical parts of the supply chain. This may include assessing the technical risks in the supply chain, as well as availability. A skilled workforce needs to be developed urgently. In addition, state-of-the art O&M concepts are required, including Industry 4.0 solutions such as digital twins and predictive maintenance, assisted by AI and machine learning.",

            "to “drive the rapid expansion of new nuclear power plants in the UK at an unprecedented scale and pace”.",
            "takes a closer look at the nuclear projects that will be supported by GBN.",
            "The launch of GBN saw the opening of registration for companies to participate in a competition to secure funding support to develop their products. This is mainly focused around developing small modular reactors (SMRs) in the UK. As the government explains: “Unlike conventional reactors that are built on site, SMRs are smaller, can be made in factories and could transform how power stations are built by making construction faster, and less expensive.”",
            "Rolls-Royce is the most advanced in developing SMRs as the leader of the UK SMR consortium, which features Atkins, Bam Nuttall, Jacobs, Laing O’Rourke, National Nuclear Laboratory, Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, TWI and Assystem.",
            "Its design for a 470MW SMR passed the first assessment hurdle in April this year.",
            "It has now moved on to Step 2 of the generic design assessment process, which is expected to take 16 months.",
            "Rolls-Royce is acting quickly though, having released",
            "a shortlist of three potential locations for its heavy pressure vessels factory",
            ", which will produce components for a fleet of SMRs. It has also met with stakeholders",
            "at potential sites for its first SMR in Oldbury and Berkeley",
            "to power up the first SMR in 2029 or early 2030s.",
            "Its pop-up factories for building SMRs could see them constructed in only 500 days.",
            "Meanwhile, another UK-based nuclear start up called Newcleo is working on its own SMR design that would use nuclear waste.",
            "It is currently seeking to raise up to £1bn to fund its delivery roadmap",
            "for its SMR, known as the Mini 30MWe LFR that will deployed in France. This will then be followed by the 200Mwe commercial unit to be deployed in the UK two years later.",
            "Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation’s micro modular reactor",
            "GBN has granted £22.5M to Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC) for the development of its micro modular reactor (MMR), a type of advanced modular reactor (AMR) suited to UK industrial demands including hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel production.",
            "USNC has match-funded the £22.5M to enable the second phase of work toward building a UK demonstrator. It has appointed Jacobs to support the design and development of the MMR.",
            "Unlike other nuclear reactors, the MMR uses no water and has no need for an electrical grid or infrastructure support. It is usable in extreme climates.",
            "The MMR’s fully ceramic micro-encapsulated fuel provides inherent reactor safety. Industry standard TRISO particles, which contain the radioactive byproducts of fission within layered ceramic coatings, are encased within a fully dense silicon carbide matrix. This combination provides an extremely rugged and stable fuel with extraordinary high temperature stability.",
            "The Seattle-based company has plans to deploy its MMRs in Poland, Finland, Canada and the USA. It has demonstration projects underway at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories and at the University of Illinios.",
            "The demonstration units are scheduled for first nuclear power in 2026.",
            "National Nuclear Laboratory’s next generation high temperature reactor",
            "GBN has committed £15M to the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) in Warrington. It is working with the Japan Atomic Energy Authority to accelerate the development of a high temperature reactor, which has already been successful in Japan.",
            "The next generation high temperature gas cooled reactors have now reached design phase. This reactor delivers much higher outlet temperatures than existing technology, allowing the heat to be used directly to decarbonise industrial processes. It will enable the large-scale production of hydrogen via electrochemical or thermochemical processes.",
            "National Nuclear Laboratory’s sovereign coated particle fuel capability",
            "High-temperature reactors use coated particle fuel and GBN has committed £16M to the NNL in Preston to continue developing its sovereign coated particle fuel capability, a critical enabler for the UK’s future energy security.",
            "The NNL recently celebrated the casting of active fuel kernels at scale. These kernels form the tiny particles of uranium, that are subsequently coated in four layers of ceramic and carbon creating coated particle fuel. Often referred to as ‘the most robust nuclear fuel’, each coated particle is roughly the size of a poppy seed – with the uranium kernel housed inside its own miniature container vessel.",
            "GBN’s Nuclear Fuel Fund is forking out £22.3M to enable eight projects to develop new fuel production and manufacturing capabilities in the UK.",
            "The biggest sum has gone to Springfields Fuels in Preston, part of the Westinghouse Group, which has received £10.5M. Nuclear fuel fabrication services have taken place at the site since the mid-1940s and today Springfield Fuels designs, manufactures and delivers fuel for nuclear plants. This includes the manufacture of oxide fuels for Advanced Gas-cooled and Light Water Reactors, as well as intermediate fuel products, such as powders, granules and pellets.",
            "A £9.56M sum has been committed to Urenco UK in Chester, a specialist in the production of advanced fuels for nuclear reactors of tomorrow. The funds will be used for the concept design of plants and processes supporting the further development of advanced fuels. It will also look at enriching uranium to higher levels to allow for reactors to run for longer between refuelling outages.",
            "MoltexFLEX, a UK molten salt reactor (MSR) developer, received £1.3M. MSRs are a type of AMR that use separate molten salts as a coolant and fuel, leading to intrinsic safety compared with conventional fuels. The funds from the Nuclear Fuel Fund will be used to develop detailed technical plans for commercial-scale delivery of its low-enriched uranium fuel salt. MoltexFLEX has developed significant proprietary data on fuel design and is expecting to partner with a major fuel supplier to establish a pathway to commercial production.",
            "Nuclear Transport Solutions (NTS) is the recipient of over £1M for the development of a new transport package that will support a new generation of nuclear reactors. The fuel – High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) – is more energy dense and requires less fuel than current nuclear power production. HALEU requires innovative transportation solutions to ensure it can be moved safely and securely to new reactor. NTS’ new package will be versatile to allow the transport of HALEU in multiple forms, such as powder or fuel elements.",
            "Advanced Nuclear Business Development",
            "As part of the funding package announced in conjunction with the launch of GBN, the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) committed up to £77.1M of funding for companies to accelerate advanced nuclear business development in the UK. This will help and support advanced nuclear designs to enter UK regulation and maximise the chance of SMRs and AMRs being built in the next Parliament.",
            "Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C",
            "While no new funds were specifically designated to the development of the UK’s in-progress large-scale nuclear power plants, the government’s announcement of GBN mentioned that it “remains committed” to them.",
            "the government committed £700M to the development of Sizewell C",
            ", a new 3,200MWe nuclear plant in Suffolk that is currently in the design phase. Sizewell C managing director Julia Pyke has said that the launch of GBN is “another big vote of confidence in Sizewell C”.",
            "Hinkley Point C is an under-construction 3,200MWe nuclear plant in Somerset. Its",
            "first nuclear reactor arrived on site in February",
            "nearing the completion of its undersea work",
            ". However, it has faced numerous construction setbacks and is now not expected to power up until the mid 2030s."

The initial down-select will take place this autumn.",
            "Further to the competition, the government is also announcing a £157M grant funding package for nuclear projects alongside the launch of GBN. Details of how it will be spent are below.",
            "GBN will initially be led by Simon Bowen and Gwen Parry-Jones as interim chair and chief executive officer respectively.",
            "Energy security and net zero secretary Grant Shapps said: “Britain has a rich history as a pioneer of nuclear power, having launched the era of civil nuclear power - and I’m proud to be turbocharging its revival and placing our country once again at the forefront of global innovation.",
            "“By rapidly boosting our homegrown supply of nuclear and other clean, reliable, and abundant energy, we will drive down bills for British homes and make sure the UK is never held to energy ransom by tyrants like Putin.",
            "“Today, as we open GBN and the competition to develop cutting-edge small modular reactor technology, which could result in billions of pounds of public and private sector investment, we are seeing the first brush strokes of our nuclear power renaissance to power up Britain and grow our economy for decades to come.”",
            "Minister for nuclear Andrew Bowie said: “As long-standing pioneers of nuclear, today we’re marking its UK revival with the opening of GBN, which will play an essential role in transforming the way we power Britain from Britain.",
            "“I look forward to seeing the world-class designs submitted from all around the world through the competitive selection process, as the UK takes its place front and centre in the global race to unleash a new generation of nuclear technology.”",

            "Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit head of energy Jess Ralston said:",
            "“A number of experts, including the Climate Change Committee, see a role for nuclear in removing gas from our power system, but with SMRs yet to be deployed and larger plants like Hinkley over-budget and delayed, it’s difficult to predict exactly what the costs and timescales might be for future endeavours. The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the high upfront costs of nuclear could leave us with a £170bn bill.",
            "“Despite slight cost increases given current inflation levels, British renewables will remain much cheaper than both gas and nuclear. There are questions over whether Government has taken its eye off the ball for the current Contracts for Difference auction round for wind farms, imposing too tight restrictions and so limiting the projects that might get built. Where Government places its focus is important for green investment from businesses, and clearly rapidly building out renewables is the best deal for the UK tax or billpayer.”",
            "Atkins nuclear and power managing director Chris Conboy said:",
            "“Today’s GB Nuclear launch is an important milestone towards establishing the critical role that nuclear will have in the UK’s net zero future. The support for small modular reactor projects should accelerate the development of technologies that have the potential to provide greater energy resilience and deliver clean, affordable power. This positive support for new technologies and investment in domestic fuel manufacture capability sits alongside a welcome continued commitment to largescale nuclear through the progress already made at Hinkley Point C and a future plant at Sizewell C. The Government’s ambition to deliver a quarter of the country’s electricity from nuclear will be achieved through the safe, efficient, cost-effective and timely delivery of new build projects, and we look forward to playing a role in engineering a nuclear-fuelled future for the UK.”",
            "BDB Pitmans partner and parliamentary agent Mustafa Latif-Aramesh said:",
            "“Today is a significant day for nuclear in the UK. The release of funding, which had been delayed, will mean that the Government is finally putting money where its mouth is for Small and Advanced Nuclear Reactors. That technology is urgently required both for energy resilience and in order to allow the UK to meet its decarbonisation targets.",
            "“The announcement should be accompanied by a renewed focus on publishing details on siting arrangements, and confirmation on Great British Nuclear’s remit in being a partner at the development phase. Government should throw resources at updating the National Policy Statement for Nuclear in advance of their 2025 target, and confirming that nuclear projects outside of existing or decommissioned nuclear sites can progress so that the private sector can deliver clean energy in tandem with GBN’s competition processes.”",
            "Turner & Townsend director and head of UK natural resources Alan Sinclair",
            "“The success of Great British Nuclear will rely on three major components: attracting investment, spurring innovation and building skills.  Lack of certainty has dogged the sector for over a decade and both investors and the supply chain are looking for a clear break from the past.  Get it right and the UK has the potential to tackle emissions and energy independence, while also establishing the foundations for a world-class industry with expertise that can be exported abroad.",
            "“Providing 24Gw of generation by 2050 is a gargantuan task and clarity over financing is the first priority.  The £20bn committed directly from Government for SMRs can kick-start the private investment that will be needed and galvanise not just operators, but also the supply chain required to build and manage these new sites.  SMRs bring a greater opportunity for off-site design and construction, and a reduced reliance on supporting infrastructure on a massive scale.  However, shaping the supply chain to support these changes in the UK’s approach will take time and careful capacity planning.",
            "“People will be crucial to success.  The requirements across defence and energy taken together amount to upwards of 250,000 roles.  That is a major undertaking in its own right and GBN will need to draw on the UK’s existing pools of talent from the energy and infrastructure sector if it is to succeed.  Above all, we need to be keenly aware that the UK is competing in a global market for talent.",
            "“Expertise in new methods of generation also needs to be matched by equivalent investment across the nuclear lifecycle - for decommissioning and waste storage - so that the industry remains self-sustaining long-term.”",
            "Balfour Beatty Group chief executive Leo Quinn said:",
            "“Great British Nuclear represents a gear change in how we power the country’s homes and businesses.",
            "“Nuclear energy is a clear and proven route to secure clean, homegrown energy – removing the reliance on costly imports. The construction and infrastructure industry continues to deliver on Hinkley Point C and is ready to get started on Sizewell C. In doing so, we can reduce energy bills, lower carbon emissions, create thousands of jobs – including apprenticeships – and cement Britain’s position as a leader in clean energy.”",
            "Stop Sizewell C, a campaign group against the nuclear reactor, said:",
            "“The postponed relaunch of GBN - which is neither Great, nor really British - contains no more than a wing and a prayer for Sizewell C.",
            "“No vote of confidence can help Sizewell C unless it has a big fat cheque attached, and the money announced today - which is all earmarked for other projects - is, in the context of expensive nuclear energy, chicken feed.”",
            "The £157M nuclear funding package has been separated as follows",
            "£77.1M of funding will be provided to companies to accelerate advanced nuclear business development in the UK and support advanced nuclear designs to enter UK regulations",
            "£58M funding will go to the further development and design of a type of advanced modular reactor (AMR) and next generation fuel. AMRs operate at a higher temperature than SMRs and as a result they could provide high temperature heat for hydrogen and other industrial uses alongside nuclear power.",

            "£10.5M will go to Westinghouse Springfields nuclear fuel plant in Preston to manufacture more innovative types of nuclear fuel for customers both in the UK and overseas, boosting jobs and skills in the North West.",
            "£9.5M to Urenco UK in Capenhurst Chester, an international supplier of nuclear materials, to enrich uranium to higher levels, including low enriched uranium (LEU+) and high assay low enriched uranium. LEU+ will allow for current reactors and SMRs to run for longer between refuelling outages."

It made the recommendation that Wylfa should be the location for the next gigawatt-scale nuclear generation plant after Sizewell C.",
            "However, the land is currently owned by Hitachi, which bought it in 2012 and pulled out of a formerly proposed Wylfa B plan in 2020 after being unable to secure funding. The Welsh Affairs Committee said in its report that “it is unclear what the current state of play is at the site” and called on the government to “encourage Hitachi to sell the Wylfa Newydd site or take part in a consortium of developers to allow future development”.",
            "The government has now responded to the report’s recommendations and said that it welcomes Hitachi’s stewardship and maintenance of the site and notes that any decision to sell it would be a commercial decision on the company’s part.",
            "It added: “We continue to have a positive relationship and strong dialogue with all nuclear site owners […] and remain in conversation with them about how to best enable and deliver on the government’s ambition for up to 24GW of nuclear energy by 2050.”",
            "The government said that the establishment of Great British Nuclear will support its considerations for gigawatt-scale nuclear projects, but that “no decisions have been taken over which technologies future projects will proceed with, or at which sites”.",
            "The Welsh Affairs Committee has taken this as a positive response but is demanding more progress in determining the plan for the Wylfa land.",
            "Welsh Affairs Committee chair Stephen Crabb MP said: “Wylfa is the next best nuclear site, after Sizewell C, to realise the UK Government’s nuclear energy ambitions. It is promising that there is a constructive and positive relationship between Ministers and Hitachi, but would like to see more progress in finding a buyer to crack on with creating a nuclear power plant.",
            "“Great British Nuclear, as called for and welcomed by our committee, is a strong and positive move by the UK Government to illustrate its commitment to the sector. Its response to our report today sets out some early priorities, and I look forward to learning of the successful SMR [small modular reactor] projects later this year.",
            "“We mustn’t lose momentum on the nuclear energy agenda, particularly given the enormous benefits it can provide for people and businesses across Wales.”",
            "The government’s response repeatedly acknowledges the need for a revision to the National Policy Statement for nuclear deployment, which was published in 2011. It is currently working on the new document, which will “set out the planning policy for deploying new nuclear power stations beyond 2025” and “take account of the changes in the nuclear landscape”. It is expected to go to consultation this year."

            "Referring to nuclear energy schemes and the energy transition overall, Tarr said Jacobs had \"a depth of experience in that space.\"",
            "He added that Jacobs’ appointment aligned with Balfour Beatty’s view of near-term opportunities in the UK’s renewable energy sector.",
            "“If you look back to the government’s energy security energy strategy, published last April, that sets out quite ambitious plans around new nuclear – with sites like Sizewell as well as small modular reactors. These present an example of how you can work with designers to develop repeatable solutions. And the carbon capture market is probably one of the key building blocks of the government’s net zero ambitions.”",
            "Balfour Beatty commented on the change: “Our Strategic Design Partnership is continually evolving. We review our partners every five years to ensure that our combined expertise and capability aligns with the upcoming market opportunities we are primed to deliver.",
            "“For the second generation of the Strategic Design Partnership, we have chosen to leverage Jacobs’ breadth of expertise in the energy sector as we align our organisation to capitalise on the decade of infrastructure growth we see in our chosen markets.",
            "WSP would remain “a key and trusted design partner on a number of significant projects,” Balfour Beatty said.",
            "Balfour Beatty has already taken advantage of the partnership's expertise for the delivery of major projects such as High Speed Two (HS2), Viking Link - an electricity interconnector between the UK and Denmark – and Hinkley Connection which involves the design, installation, testing and commissioning of a new overhead line on behalf of National Grid.",
            "The contractor said that its customers have been benefiting from the partnership, as they have been gaining earlier access to a co-ordinated design and construction team.",
            "Jacobs people and places solutions vice president and executive sponsor Bruce Chalmers commented: “The strategic design partnership enables closer integration of our collective expertise to drive efficiencies and co-create value-focused solutions for long-term transformation.",
            "“This is an exciting opportunity to help shape the future of UK infrastructure delivery, putting sustainability and different ways of working at the heart to build better outcomes for society and the environment.”"

            "As the government strives to expand capacity to meet future electricity demand, nuclear power and tidal energy are at the opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of support.",
            "ew sources of electricity generation must be built and brought online in the next decade if the government is to achieve its aim of decarbonising the UK’s power system by 2035.",
            "To reach the goals set out in the government’s Net Zero Strategy, published in October 2021, the UK will need to more than double its current 108GW of total installed capacity to meet the projected demand of between 218GW and 262GW in 2035.",
            "Analysis by consultant Atkins in June 2022 showed that 49GW of electricity generation assets will go offline by 2035 – a mixture of nuclear power plants, fossil fuel plants and older renewables. As a result around 14GW of new build capacity must be added each year if demand in 2035 is to be met. But since 2010, the average capacity added annually has only been slightly more than 4GW.",
            "Alongside offshore wind power, the government has committed to nuclear power as the main source of energy to make up this shortfall. It has not yet released a target energy mix for 2035, but it is expected that solar will account for a chunk. In contrast no commitments to tidal energy development have been made, so this source’s contribution is expected to be minimal.",
            "Nuclear power stations in the UK currently have a combined capacity of 6.5GW, accounting for 15% of the energy mix. The government’s aim is for that to reach 24GW by 2050.",
            "That is more difficult to achieve than it appears, as four of the UK’s five operating nuclear plants accounting for 4.84GW of capacity will be decommissioned within a decade. The new nuclear plants in development, Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C, will provide a combined capacity of over 6.4GW. They will more than cover the capacity that is due to be decommissioned but to go beyond that more investment and forward planning is needed.",
            "Building nuclear power plants is costly in terms of time and money.",
            "The 3.2GW capacity Hinkley Point C power station",
            "has encountered continuous cost increases and construction delays. It is now expected to cost £32.7bn compared to the £16bn forecast in 2012 and is expected to come online in 2028 – 11 years after construction started and three years later than the planned 2025 completion date.",
            "Atkins nuclear new build market director Tom Lambkin believes these complications will decrease with repetition. “The whole philosophy from Hinkley Point C to Sizewell C is no change, it’s pure replication. It’s a repetition of a design that’s already been built within the UK regulatory environment,” he says.",
            "“That’s where the opportunities for efficiencies start to come; if we build a third site, those efficiencies will be magnified even further.”",
            "Plans for 3.26GW capacity Sizewell C are progressing and in November 2022 the government committed £700M to it. It has also been confirmed that Sizewell C will be funded through the regulated asset base model, where the government takes on the construction risk and consumers pay back the costs through increased energy bills.",
            "Plans for the construction of the 3.26GW capacity Sizewell C in Suffolk are progressing",
            "Although this is the first time this funding model has been used for a nuclear plant, it has been written into law that future nuclear projects will be funded in this way.",
            "There are no concrete plans to build any more large scale nuclear plants at present. Instead, plans for small modular reactors (SMRs) are advancing. Rolls-Royce’s design for a 470MW SMR has passed the first assessment hurdle and the company hopes the first one would be online by 2030.",
            "SMRs could be crucial to efforts to decarbonise the energy system, with their small size being their main advantage. “It’s a smaller capital cost to build the first and then revenue generation from that can be reinvested in subsequent stations,” Lambkin says.",
            "“Their small scale also unlocks potential sites that aren’t suitable for large scale nuclear projects.”",
            "Lambkin emphasises that SMR and conventional nuclear plants are going to be crucial when it comes to meeting the decarbonisation targets.",
            "The government established Great British Nuclear in the spring Budget in March. It has the objective of facilitating delivery of the government’s programme of new nuclear projects. Its first task is to identify the best SMR technology.",
            "Renewable energy is going to have to play a massive part in decarbonising the power industry. There are nearly 3,000 renewable projects at different stages of planning and construction in the government’s Renewable Energy Planning Database. Even if all of these are completed, they will not cover the capacity shortfall anticipated in 2035.",
            "Aside from offshore windfarms, the only renewables project in planning with over 1GW of installed capacity is the Coire Glas pumped storage hydroelectricity scheme.",
            "Another form of renewable energy that could provide high generating",
            "capacity is tidal range power produced",
            "by tidal lagoons or tidal barrages.",
            "Tidal range power is generated by building a barrage across a river or estuary, or a lagoon in a bay, then using the tides to create a water level difference on each side. This stores up potential energy, which is then used as the water is released through the barrage wall, spinning turbines to generate power.",
            "Tidal range power is different from tidal stream power, the more common type of tidal energy scheme. This features turbines on the seabed that generate energy as water moves through them.",
            "Four tidal stream power schemes are operational in the UK, with a meagre combined capacity of 10MW. Another seven are at various stages of planning and construction, but combined these will only provide 667MW of capacity.",
            "Of the two, tidal range power has the potential to make a significant contribution to the energy mix in the UK according to Cardiff University emeritus professor of water and environmental engineering Roger Falconer. He notes that the west coast of the UK has some of the highest tidal ranges in the world, making it ideal for lagoon or barrage schemes.",
            "There are currently eight projects on the west coast that are proposed or in the very early stages of development and they could provide more than 20GW of capacity. The annual output of a tidal range power scheme is about a quarter of that of a nuclear plant of comparable capacity due to tidal output not being constant in the way nuclear generation is. But tidal range schemes have a design life of 120 years – double that of nuclear power stations.",
            "Tidal energy also has the advantage of being entirely predictable, unlike wind and solar energy.",
            "But the government has shown no inclination to support tidal range power schemes.",
            "“From what we’re seeing, that’s not a technology that’s been mentioned in any of the government scenarios,” Lambkin admits.",
            "he whole philosophy from Hinkley Point C to Sizewell C is no change, it’s pure replication",
            "Falconer says this technology has been proved at scale overseas, most notably with France’s 240MW capacity tidal barrage on the River Rance and South Korea’s 254MW capacity Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station.",
            "Most of the proposed UK schemes would have larger capacities than those. The biggest, the Severn Barrage, is projected to have a generating capacity of at least 8GW. However, such schemes require a large investment commitment up front, which causes hesitance.",
            "Falconer is positive that the money can be found with the right messaging.",
            "“If the government were to say it thinks the UK has enormous potential with tidal energy and it wanted to help it get off the ground, then I think we would raise the private investment to take things forward,” he says.",
            "“I think we could see tidal range play a major part in producing green, indigenous energy.”",
            "No tidal range power scheme has been built in the UK so the construction timeframe is uncertain, but Falconer believes it would take around 10 years to secure consents and carry out construction work.",
            "One tidal range scheme, the 320MW Swansea Bay tidal lagoon, has won planning consent in the UK. But the development consent order lapsed in 2020 after five years without work starting on site.",
            "Falconer believes it is important to make a start on developing tidal range power schemes in the UK as soon as possible. Similar to the offshore wind industry, initiating the construction of tidal schemes will begin the formation of a supply chain that will grow and strengthen, Falconer explains. This will make construction of subsequent tidal range power schemes cheaper and more efficient.",
            "Although tides are predictable, the tide times vary so sometimes the highest energy production on a tidal range scheme will be in the middle of the night. Like all renewable energy sources, tidal power’s value will be more significant if it can be stored for dispatch at peak hours.",
            "Ways of developing high capacity energy storage are also needed so that the troughs in energy capacity can be evened out.",
            "Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit head of analysis Simon Cran-McGreehin says that good progress with high capacity battery storage technology is being made although it is not used widely enough.",
            "Until large scale battery storage is widespread, the government might not be ready to commit to large-scale tidal range schemes. However, Cran-McGreehin says that recent developments in other energy sectors suggest there is a glimmer of hope that this view will shift.",
            "“The government is taking a huge public sector stake in Sizewell C, having previously hoped that nuclear power plants would be built by the market alone,” he says. “So I think its appetite for putting up money for big energy projects has changed.”"

            "Building small modular nuclear reactors within pop up factories could make the construction of nuclear power capacity faster.",
            "uring his Spring Budget statement, chancellor Jeremy Hunt said that nuclear is a “critical source of cheap and reliable energy” that could help the UK meet its net zero obligations. The high cost and long process for building conventional nuclear power stations like EDF’s 3.26GW Hinkley Point C has made small modular reactors (SMRs) an attractive proposition.",
            "SMRs have comparatively lower electricity generating capacity, but their smaller size and modular design means they can be brought online faster. In the Budget, Hunt announced that the first focus of new government body Great British Nuclear (GBN) is a competition to develop SMR projects, with winners announced by the end of the year. If SMRs are demonstrated to be viable, the government will co-fund the new technology.",
            "A number of firms are vying to develop SMRs. Among them is Rolls-Royce SMR which is developing one and working with Bam Nuttall to improve the construction process. With its 470MW SMR power stations, Rolls-Royce aims to offer a product that is predominantly constructed using standard prefabricated components. It plans to build dedicated factories to produce them.",
            "Bam Nuttall is one of the key partners in the UK SMR consortium, led by Rolls-Royce, which hopes to deliver an SMR by the early 2030s.",
            "470MW SMRs will be predominantly constructed using standard prefabricated components",
            "When Rolls-Royce had the initial conversations with Bam Nuttall about building the SMRs there was an emphasis on certainty of programme and fast delivery. Rolls-Royce established a target to construct each SMR within 500 days, which seemed impossible to achieve using traditional construction methods.",
            "Bam Nuttall nuclear director John Prothero looked into factors which negatively affect productivity on conventional nuclear energy construction schemes to address them for the SMR project.",
            "Weather conditions and moving labour, materials and machinery around the site were identified as key factors.",
            "Bam Nuttall came up with the concept of a pop up facility dubbed Site Factory and has been working with consultant Expedition Engineering on its design. Site Factory is a 290m long, 130m wide and 63m tall steel superstructure, under which all the construction activities – including the bulk earthworks – takes place.",
            "The superstructure is designed to be fully modular so it can be dismantled and re-used. An opaque, lightweight PVC membrane was selected for the exterior of the roof and sides.",
            "Expedition Engineering senior director Ed McCann emphasises the fact that “it is not just a shed, it is a construction machine”. It incorporates a system comprising 30 overhead cranes across five gantries which are integrated into the roof structure.",
            "t is not just a shed, it is a construction machine",
            "The individual cranes would have a capacity between 25t and 100t, but the system has been designed to enable the use of several crane units to lift a single load of up to 300t.",
            "“Having the sky full of hooks will allow us to have multiple work fronts throughout the whole process, enabling us to improve productivity significantly,” Prothero highlights.",
            "McCann says that the superstructure",
            "could be completed in six months. The roof would be built at ground level, with the crane system mounted in it. Each of the legs would feature a jacking arrangement so the roof structure can be pushed upwards.",
            "All construction activities will be carried out within the Site Factory (Credit: Bam Nuttall, Patent No. GB 2591785)",
            "Prothero points out that this concept protects the “environment from the project and the project from the environment” with minimal noise, air and water pollution and light spill. He says that this would be significant mitigation when submitting an environmental impact assessment supporting a Development Consent Order application.",
            "The Site Factory would also minimise the impact of the weather on the construction process as work would take place indoors. An exercise carried out by Rolls-Royce and Bam using weather data revealed that bad weather can cost conventional nuclear build projects 109 days a year.",
            "“I don’t think people really understand how much time we lose to poor weather in construction,” says McCann. “Programmes are continuously being re-engineered because we are not controlling the external environment.”",
            "Another advantage of the Site Factory over nuclear power construction is the ease with which materials can be moved around. Distributing materials and components at the Site Factory using the overhead cranes means the process is unaffected by changes at ground level.",
            "aving the sky full of hooks will allow us to have multiple work fronts throughout the whole process",
            "The Site Factory also offers improved programme certainty. With the logistics of transporting and installing the SMR components and materials carefully planned, McCann says a level of precision similar to that of the manufacturing industry is possible.",
            "He adds: “At the moment the unit of programming in construction is a week. If we want the benefits that they [manufacturing industry] get, we’ve got to get down to the minutes.”",
            "When designing the Site Factory, Bam Nuttall and Expedition Engineering focused on the circular economy. The aim is for each Site Factory to have at least three life cycles, after which the steel components can be repurposed in the secondary market.",
            "The carbon footprint of each factory and its operation over three life cycles has been estimated to be 21,000t.",
            "“But you need to put that into the context that if we can take three years off a programme, millions of tonnes of carbon emissions [generated by non-renewable energy sources] would be offset with a nuclear power station,” says McCann.",
            "Bam Nuttall has secured the UK patent for the Site Factory concept and is now seeking them in other countries. Although it is new, the concept is based on tried and tested technologies, for example overhead cranes for tandem lifts.",
            "“The innovation is in the way we put it all together, rather than any particular piece of kit that’s in there,” explains McCann.",
            "He adds that the team would be able to further reduce project risk by carrying out digital rehearsals and, when appropriate, physical rehearsals of the different jobs.",
            "Bam Nuttall and Expedition Engineering are currently developing all the requirements to deliver the SMR, among which are access, power supplies, heat and fume extraction. “Once that is finalised and agreed with Rolls-Royce, then we move to the detailed design phase,” Prothero says.",
            "Whether the Site Factory concept progresses further than the design phase in the UK will depend on the outcome of the GBN’s competition. But the concept’s approach to industrialising the construction process for complex projects to boost productivity can be an inspiration for the construction industry."

            "The UK’s energy and infrastructure sectors have shown positivity towards the government’s latest tranche of commitments to drive investment in green energy, but stress that “significant questions remain” and it is just a step on the long journey to net zero.",
            "The Department for Net Zero and Energy Security’s newly published",
            "Powering Up Britain – Energy Security Plan",
            "outlines how the government plans to scale up clean homegrown power, build the UK’s green industries and boost the country’s energy security",
            ". Measures include commitment to the development of Carbon Capture Usage and Storage (CCUS) technologies, kickstarting the UK’s floating offshore wind industry, launching Great British Nuclear, backing green hydrogen production projects, speeding up the planning process to attract investment and measures to improve properties’ energy efficiency.",
            "However, the plan also affirms the government’s commitment to “maximising the vital production of UK oil and gas as the North Sea basin declines”.",
            "Prime minister Rishi Sunak said the measures will “power Britain and ensure our energy security in the long term with more affordable, clean energy from Britain, so we can drive down energy prices and grow our economy”.",
            "Commentators from the energy, housing and infrastructure sectors have been more reserved in their assessment of what the",
            "ICE head of policy Chris Richards was damning in his assessment: “In the face of calls for certainty and urgency from the Climate Change Committee, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the National Infrastructure Commission in recent weeks the UK government has chosen today to largely restate existing policy and missed the opportunity to set out the additional detail needed to enable sectors to ramp up the transition to net zero.",
            "“There are still not enough clear policy frameworks, disparate funding pots and questions on technology choices are still unanswered.",
            "“Even the government admits that today’s measures don’t go far enough – they expect to miss the 6th Carbon Budget.",
            "“As the ICE said at the Budget, with other countries incentivising huge levels of investment into new technology and the infrastructure needed to support the net zero transition, global competition for talent and resources has never been greater – without a similar degree of certainty the UK risks getting left behind.”",
            "National Infrastructure Commission chair Sir John Armitt was more balanced in his appraisal: “Today’s set of announcements includes steps forward in some areas, but in others, based on what we’ve seen so far significant questions remain as to whether the scale of interventions will be sufficient to drive change quickly enough. We need to move from setting targets to delivering on the ground, making it easier for every household to make the greener choices necessary to meet our climate commitments.",
            "“We welcomed the investment in CCUS when it was first announced and it is good to see further steps in forming carbon capture clusters. We must keep up this pace to ensure the UK regains pace in this internationally competitive sector.",
            "“We look forward to seeing the promised draft national policy statements for energy. Once finalised, these should speed up decision making and help provide greater certainty to developers, investors and communities.",
            "“The commission will continue to monitor delivery of infrastructure commitments made as a result of our own recommendations. Shortly we will publish a report on the planning regime for major infrastructure projects, and later this year we will publish our second National Infrastructure Assessment to look ahead to the next phase of the net zero journey, including the infrastructure networks needed to underpin CCUS and hydrogen technologies.”",
            "Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit head of energy Jess Ralston bemoaned the government’s continued commitment to fossil fuels. She said: “The gas crisis has made it clear that real energy security comes from moving away from oil and gas, particularly as the North Sea inevitably declines. With bills still high, no new money for insulation will leave many households in the cold.",
            "“The chancellor pushing back the response to the US Inflation Reduction Act and EU Net Zero Industry Act to the autumn could be the final nail in the coffin for businesses and offshore wind investors who will simply move investment to where there is long term policy and regulatory certainty.",
            "“If government doesn’t create a level playing field for renewables compared to oil and gas, with inflation running high, this could see new wind farms still much cheaper than gas, but not as cheap as the last round approved. The International Energy Agency, UN Secretary General and Climate Change Committee are all clear that more oil and gas in the UK isn't aligned with net zero, and won't help to lower bills or improve energy security.”",
            "Association of Consultancy and Engineering (ACE) head of policy Guto Davies also pointed out the holes. He added: “Today’s newly published strategy sets out some important steps to reach net zero by 2050 through clarifying finance, the UK’s role in international leadership and influence, strategic policy aims and the future direction of innovation and research.",
            "“But there remain many unanswered questions. This has already been a lengthy process, so implementation is now crucial given our 2030 and 2050 targets.”",
            "Royal Academy of Engineering president Sir Jim McDonald greeted the policy warmly, but pointed out some other omissions. He said: “We welcome the inclusion of a home insulation scheme in these plans, as home retrofit is a vital low-regrets measure that can reduce energy demand while improving people’s wellbeing. However, retrofit measures must be coupled with efforts to ensure that the skills, supply chains, governance and assurance mechanisms are in place if we are to succeed in future-proof UK housing.",
            "“The issue of skills to support the net zero transition is continually missed from the conversation. Just as the demand for engineering skills is increasing within the key sectors of the future clean economy, the supply of engineering skills in the UK is failing to keep up with demand. New ways of learning and training must be developed locally and supported by individuals, employers, education, and training providers. We urge government to implement the recommendations from the Green Jobs Taskforce.",
            "“We would also like to see the introduction of a formal system of governance for translating high-level targets to national and local levels. A government delivery body, such as the Office for Net Zero proposed in the Skidmore Review, is needed to lead and coordinate climate strategies across different sectors and spheres of society. And urgent action is required if we are to achieve the vital goal of a fully decarbonised electricity grid by 2035. We agree with the objectives set out by Ofgem, addressing the scale and range of factors affecting the future development of our gas and electricity networks. Experts from our National Engineering Policy Centre are actively looking at the actions and barriers that need to be addressed to implement a net zero electricity grid.”",
            "The University of Edinburgh chair of carbon capture and storage Stuart Haszledine praised the backing of CCUS technology, saying “guarantees of £20bn provide confidence for tens of commercial investors, partnering in multiple projects, to build a climate-saving CO",
            "storage ambition unequalled in the world”. However, Haszeldine was critical of the government’s continued commitment to oil and gas, saying: “The government is trying to ride a green industrial CCUS horse and a black oil and gas stallion simultaneously, making this a long overdue start to carbon clean up, but an incomplete carbon transition.”",
            "Mineral Products Association director for energy and climate change Diana Casey highlighted holes in the government’s plans when it comes to carbon leakage. She said: “High carbon and energy costs faced by UK cement manufacturers puts them at a significant disadvantage compared to cheaper imported products from countries where these costs are lower.",
            "“While consultation in the UK is welcome, the EU has already taken action and a UK Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is now urgently needed to reduce the risk of carbon leakage, protect jobs and help the UK remain competitive.",
            "“There remains a significant shortcoming in UK net zero legislation because emissions targets can be met, or partially met, by buying more imported goods in place of domestic production. This simply moves responsibility for emissions to other countries. Ignoring these offshores UK responsibility for the emissions in the goods it consumes, leaving the problem out of sight and out of mind.”",
            "Pinsent Masons energy partner Stacey Collins was positive about the plans regarding CCUS: “The government had already committed to £20bn of funding for the CCUS industry but today we have a clearer pathway for development of the projects that will actually deliver on the promise of that funding. It’s long-awaited news for the successful Track-1 Phase 2 projects. Those projects that weren’t selected, and other projects already in development, will now set their sights on the confirmed Track-1 expansion process (to be launched later this year) and the announced Track-2 process.",
            "“It’s certainly going to be the busy 2023 for the sector, but there’s still a lot of work needed to get the required CCUS projects to financial close and into the construction phase. This is not the end of the journey, but an important milestone nonetheless.”",
            "Collins also sees green shoots for hydrogen technologies: “The announced shortlisted Hydrogen Business Model/Net Zero Hydrogen Fund Round 1 projects, and the commitment to Round 2 opening later this year is important to those across the market who are investing time and money in bringing the promise of low-carbon hydrogen to life. The government has restated its commitment to funding the development of low-carbon hydrogen for power, energy storage, transportation, heating, fuel-switching and industrial use. We have an opportunity in the UK to be world leaders in low-carbon hydrogen deployment, today’s commitments keep the industry on that pathway.”",
            "Stantec UK climate solutions leader Lucy Wood was positive about the UK’s prospects of rising to the net zero challenge. She said: “Tackling climate change and energy security will always go hand in hand with improving economic stability and growth. So, it’s encouraging to see the government positioning energy, consumer, climate, and economic security to be delivered together.",
            "“As an island nation, we must further accelerate the delivery of renewable energy through the likes of offshore wind and floating windfarms. We should be making the most of our extensive and unique port and coastal infrastructure while bolstering the supply chains and communities that support them.",
            "“The same can be said in the roll-out of green hydrogen and there is a huge opportunity here to position the UK as a global leader in innovation.",
            "“It should be noted, however, that a core consideration to the delivery and distribution of renewable energy is our ability to connect the necessary infrastructure to the grid, and the ability of the grid to adapt to the added challenges posed by this generation. Allowing for the intermittency of renewables requires a strategic rethink. Clear enabling behaviours from government supporting proven methods like pump hydro storage would help industry commit to schemes with confidence and pace.",
            "“It is positive to see the government acknowledging the need to accelerate the transformation of the grid, so we can realise the potential we have as an island nation.",
            "“It is also promising to see the link made to international climate action and our contribution to the global climate finance goal.",
            "“This will help build on the UK’s reputation as a climate leader, enhancing our credibility when exporting our expertise and further driving investment and economic growth.”",
            "British Property Federation chief executive Melanie Leech said",
            ": “Today’s report is another statement of intent when what we need is urgent action.",
            "“If government is serious about achieving net zero by 2050 there must be more recognition of the challenges in decarbonising the built environment, which accounts for around 25% of UK emissions.",
            "“While the report acknowledges the planning ‘bottleneck’ in updating historic and listed buildings, there must be more urgency in aligning the planning system to the net zero agenda and a national retrofit strategy that supports and incentivises green refurbishment.",
            "“We also need clarity on minimum energy efficiency standards and regulation that establishes a clear and consistent methodology for measuring the environmental performance of a building over its full life cycle, which will guide the property sector in how to approach development and refurbishment.",
            "“The property sector is fully committed to net zero but government must seize the moment and deliver bolder and more ambitious policies that will support the rapid change needed.”",
            "WSP executive director Rachel Skinner said:",
            "“Many of the measures announced today are welcome and we support the Government’s ambition and focus. Progress towards a diverse, clean energy supply and decarbonisation of our housing stock are clear priorities, so continued support for offshore wind and nuclear power, acceleration of carbon capture and hydrogen and provision for increased home energy efficiency is all positive.",
            "“What we must not lose sight of, however, is the pace, direction and scale of change required and the twinned complexity of decarbonisation and climate resilience when set against the ever-shorter time to act, not only in the UK but globally. The recent IPCC and Climate Change Committee reports could not be more clear: we are losing the battle to limit global warming to 1.5°C and we are unprepared for the impact this change will have on our infrastructure, natural resources, supply chains and daily lives.",
            "“The slower we are to respond to these immense challenges, the higher the cost and risk will be as we try to cope with the issues they create in the years to come. Focused action and investment at a faster pace will help to unlock the full economic potential of net zero for the UK.",
            "“The reality of the climate crisis gives us no choice but to act – it is an imperative. The nature of global existential threats means that we should expect fierce international competition for green projects and skills. Relative lack of action will see crucial investment and jobs go elsewhere. Long-term certainty from government and a systems-thinking approach to regulation, funding and skills is key to building confidence, ensuring that the UK realises the many economic opportunities, also the wider social and environmental benefits, of a green economy.”",
            "Turner & Townsend net zero director James Hardy said:",
            "“The government has been faced with the unenviable task of setting out the nation’s overall path to net zero. While the overarching nature of the strategy is welcome, we need more detail on how the UK closes the gap in policy and funding to move it closer to meeting its legally binding carbon targets.",
            "“The approach to net zero has too long felt piecemeal, with pockets of good new funding and exciting schemes, but little overarching strategy to draw it together. Today’s announcements mostly summarise the government’s existing pledges and projects, but the move to bring them together, supported by a new dedicated Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, goes some way to responding to the calls for joined-up thinking in Chris Skidmore’s recent review. This approach was underlined by the commitment to Great British Nuclear as a coordinating delivery body, and a promise to use that model as an example for other green sectors too.",
            "“We were not expecting new funding following the recent Budget and it is positive that growing sectors like CCUS and green hydrogen are receiving the investment they need, as well as a renewed approach to private green finance. In addition, innovative programmes that have yet to be proven such as small modular reactors and floating wind power will be driven forward by new competitions. However, these investments are unlikely to increase our energy security and reduce bills overnight.",
            "“Perhaps the most quietly bold policy announced is the consultation on carbon border taxes. Charging for goods’ and materials’ carbon footprint from overseas would radically reshape the global supply chain, and potentially boost domestic manufacture and local skills, but we will need to see the full detail on this as it emerges.”",
            "“The main question we’ll all be asking is how industry and government can come together to keep this strategy evolving. We need commitments as well as competitions. There is more to be done to move beyond a policy summary towards offering more long-term clarity and future funding milestones – this will give the sector the additional confidence they need to deliver green investment, build skills and capacity, and develop innovative technologies that will transform the UK and protect the planet.”",
            "Atkins Nuclear & Power managing director Christophe Junillon said:",
            "“Today’s announcement by government on ‘Powering Up Britain’ is positive progress in the right direction to accelerate the pace of power decarbonisation.",
            "“GBN and its focus on SMR technology is particularly welcome and will help the industry to maintain momentum in the development and commercialisation of SMR and help realise its potential in our future energy mix alongside larger reactors.",
            "“Wind, solar, nuclear, carbon capture, hydrogen and storage technologies are all essential contributors to a future system to be deployed in parallel. We will need all of them, in the right locations, to achieve energy security and affordability as well as reach net zero. Yet the critical path for deployment lies in the creation of the connecting infrastructure and streamlining of the planning system.",
            "“The report rightly reiterates a high level of ambition and recognises the urgent need for detailed policies and mechanisms to create the confidence that will bring forward investment and increase the build rate of new generation and infrastructure.",
            "“This build rate must be a defining reference point of our energy transition: with just 12 years until the 2035 target to decarbonise power, the rate at which new generation and infrastructure is moving through the planning pipeline, being built and coming online is the main indicator as to whether the UK is on track to meet its ambitious targets.",
            "“The creation of near term milestones against which progress to the long term goals can be measured must be included in the government’s net zero strategy. The interdependency of the many ambitions means there is a critical need for an overall deployment strategy and plan: we have consistently recommended the creation of an Energy System Architect accountable for the delivery of such a plan and thus the urgency for the definition and creation of the Future System Operator cannot be understated.”",
            "J Murphy & Sons chief executive John Murphy said:",
            "“At J Murphy & Sons, we are fully committed to supporting the government's Energy Security Strategy, working with our partners to deliver the sustainable infrastructure that the UK needs and we welcome the government's initiatives to boost investment in clean growth sectors, including reforming the planning process to enable the building of more energy infrastructure, CCUS and the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund.",
            "“We believe that the development of renewable energy sources such as wind power, low carbon technologies and efficient power plants are essential to the country achieving its net zero ambitions, while also ensuring that we continue to meet current energy demands by safely maintaining existing infrastructure. Measures like those announced today provide us and our industry partners with a clear direction of travel, though the challenge of course will be to translate these plans into reality.",
            "“We remain ready to support the government in the delivery of critical national infrastructure and are looking forward to continuing to play a key role in helping the UK to achieve its net-zero emissions target and help build a stable environment for the future.”",
            "Welsh Affairs Committee chair Stephen Crabb MP said",
            ": “I welcome the government’s announcements today around floating offshore wind and nuclear energy: representing steps to enhance home-grown energy.",
            "“On the back of last week’s announcement on freeports, it is very welcome that the government has now launched a funding scheme to encourage investment in infrastructure to support Floating Offshore Wind. This could turbocharge efforts to see open up the Celtic Sea to the green energy revolution, offering enormous economic opportunities for Welsh communities. It is essential that Welsh ports receive a fair share of the £160M package.”",
            "“For some time the nuclear sector has called for greater clarity on the government’s ambitions, and the policy announcements today on nuclear energy is in line with what we have been calling for. The full launch of GBN should go some way to reassure the sector and motivate them to invest. I wish its interim chair and chief executive the best in their endeavours, and look forward to seeing the detail of the SMR technology competition when it launches. It is absolutely right that the Government is looking to match global competitors so we are not left behind in establishing and reaping the benefits of gigawatt scale nuclear, as well as from small modular reactors.”",
            "Amey chief executive Andy Milner said:",
            "“Amey’s capabilities from design to delivery across transport and the built environment makes us well placed to speed up the transition to net zero, and we welcome the government’s renewed focus on creating the policy and regulatory landscape required to drive competition and unlock the investment required to ensure energy security while achieving net zero commitments.",
            "“The development of innovative and resilient infrastructure solutions is critical for the UK, and we are pleased that the government has listened to the National Infrastructure Commission who called for more targeted initiatives to deliver the infrastructure needed to reach the government’s long-term net zero and economic goals.",
            "“Following public policy interventions in the EU and US, it was crucial for the government to act quickly to ensure the UK’s competitiveness in a global market, and the decisions today clearly set the foundations for Amey and wider industry to deliver on the UK’s energy transition. It is now key that our industry works collaboratively with government to deliver new green jobs and skills to create a positive impact in the communities we serve. Amey stands ready to do just that and will continue to play a leading role in supporting our clients in their transition to net zero, while providing the services and infrastructure that millions across the UK rely on every day.”",
            "A Stop Sizewell C spokesperson said:",
            "“The government has reiterated its intention to provide state support for nuclear energy but given no indication on how it intends to pay for it. Given nuclear energy's massively expensive track record, promising GBN ‘the funding it needs’ amounts to a blank cheque, likely at the expense of other technologies and initiatives.",
            "“Ministers have backed themselves into a corner becoming co-owners of Sizewell C given that it's not yet financed. When are they going to come clean about how much it will really cost? And if investors say “no”, just how much taxpayers’ money will the government have to pour into this widening black hole? With our urgent need for energy solutions that are low cost and deliverable quickly and reliably, Sizewell C stands out like a sore thumb.",
            "“As Hinkley Point C and other disastrous EPR builds show, Sizewell C would be a slow, expensive mistake and EDF would likely still be struggling to build this unproven reactor in 2035, while other technologies were either racing away, or strapped for investment.",
            "“The government is adamant that nuclear’s inclusion in the green taxonomy is necessary for investors to consider Sizewell C, but if the consultation is not held until the Autumn, would they begin a capital raise for Sizewell C before that concludes? This seems unlikely and could affect the timing for a Final Investment Decision.",
            "“If Sizewell C was ever eventually completed, the electricity would be far more expensive than renewables - hardly “cheap” as the Energy Security Secretary claims. Questions about uranium supply and the long term nuclear waste problems show that it is certainly neither green nor clean.”",
            "Octopus Energy Group chief executive and founder Greg Jackson said",
            ": “We're delighted the government is looking to remove outdated levies from electricity bills. A cheaper, greener, more secure future is an electrified future - and ending these taxes on increasingly clean electricity is essential.",
            "“The government redoubling its commitment to heat pumps is hugely welcome. These are the most efficient way to heat a home and the UK could create hundreds of thousands of clean jobs as we make our homes warmer, more comfortable and cheaper to heat.”"

            "Richards, also former climate advisor to Boris Johnson, further stated he believes the only way the UK can cut its dependence on imported oil and gas is with “necessary planning reform.”",
            "He said: “We [Britain Remade] want to slash the time it takes to build new offshore wind from 12 to five years, end the band on onshore wind, slash the time it takes to build solar on the ground to within 15 months and unleash a revolution in rooftop servers,” as well as having two small nuclear modular reactors and at least 10 units of long-term storage hooked up to the grids by the end of the decade.”",

            "is a serious guide to the decisions we need to realise the vision of the UK being a net energy exporter by the 2030s.",
            "From creating a one-stop shop for planning decisions to curbing the risk of judicial review, it’s full of bold but deliverable recommendations. When I was a minister, this was precisely the kind of go-to tool I was looking for, and I hope the government will seize on it and commit to urgent action to make the UK safer, greener and more successful.”"

            "The UK Space Agency has announced £2.9M worth of funding towards an initial demonstration of a nuclear reactor developed by Rolls-Royce for use on the Moon.",
            "Scientists and engineers at Rolls-Royce are working on a micro-reactor programme to develop nuclear technology that will provide power needed for humans to live and work on the Moon.",
            "Research by Rolls-Royce has looking at how nuclear power could be used to support a future Moon base for astronauts. Current plans would see a reactor ready to send to the Moon by 2029.",
            "The new funding follows a £249,000 study funded by the UK Space Agency in 2022.",
            "The Department of Science, Innovation and Technology minister state George Freeman said: “Space exploration is the ultimate laboratory for so many of the transformational technologies we need on Earth: from materials to robotics, nutrition, cleantech and much more.",
            "“As we prepare to see humans return to the Moon for the first time in more than 50 years, we are backing exciting research like this lunar modular reactor with Rolls-Royce to pioneer new power sources for a lunar base.",
            "“Partnerships like this, between British industry, the UK Space Agency and government are helping to create jobs across our £16bn SpaceTech sector and help ensure the UK continues to be a major force in frontier science.”",
            "All space missions depend on a power source to support systems for communications, life-support and experiments. Most famously the Voyager program uses nuclear batteries, or Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators, and is still exploring space with its Voyager 1 and 2 probes 45 years after launching.",
            "The UK Space Agency believe nuclear power has the potential to dramatically increase the duration of future Lunar missions and their scientific value.",
            "Relatively small and lightweight, a nuclear micro-reactor could be used to provide continuous power regardless of location, available sunlight and other environmental conditions, according to the agency.",
            "UK Space Agency chief executive Dr Paul Bate said: “We are backing technology and capabilities to support ambitious space exploration missions and boost sector growth across the UK. Developing space nuclear power offers a unique chance to support innovative technologies and grow our nuclear, science and space engineering skills base.",
            "“This innovative research by Rolls-Royce could lay the groundwork for powering continuous human presence on the Moon, while enhancing the wider UK space sector, creating jobs and generating further investment.”",
            "The partnership with Rolls-Royce comes after the UK Space Agency recently announced £51M funding for UK companies to develop communication and navigation services for missions to the Moon. This was part of the European Space Agency’s Moonlight programme, which aims to launch a constellation of satellites into orbit around the Moon.",
            "Nuclear space power is also anticipated to create new skilled jobs across the UK to support the burgeoning UK space economy.",

            "The potential applications of Rolls-Royce micro-reactor technology are considered to be wide-ranging and could support commercial and defence use cases in addition to those in space. The UK Space Agency and Rolls-Royce’s aim is to “create a world-leading power and propulsion capability for multiple markets and operator needs” while providing a long-lasting and green source of energy.",
            "Rolls-Royce director of future programmes Abi Clayton said: “The new tranche of funding from the UK Space Agency means so much for the Rolls-Royce micro-reactor programme. We’re proud to work collaboratively with the UK Space Agency and the many UK academic institutions to showcase the best of UK innovation and knowledge in space.",
            "“This funding will bring us further down the road in making the micro-reactor a reality, with the technology bringing immense benefits for both space and Earth.",

            "“If we don’t replace our existing nuclear power stations which are coming to an end, we will find it virtually impossible to meet our climate change targets.” These words were spoken in 2007, by then prime minister Tony Blair – but are not far from the language used by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in Wednesday’s budget. Sixteen years on from Blair’s speech and a remarkable 28 years from the opening of the UK’s most recent reactor, the dial is now beginning to shift.",
            "Lucy Howard is head of markets (infrastructure) at Turner & Townsend",
            "Nuclear formed a central plank of last year’s energy security strategy with ambitions for eight new reactors in development by 2030 and 24GW of nuclear generation capacity by 2050. A new body was promised to oversee the development of this pipeline: Great British Nuclear (GBN). This was formally launched by the chancellor in this week’s budget, without new detail on its role, alongside optimistic language and promises of eventual investment in small modular reactors (SMRs). But there are several steps government still needs to take to work with our industry and ensure that this new nuclear age is a success.",
            "One of the major blockages where government is already making progress is with creating robust financing models. Previously, investors in the development and construction of reactors could only create returns after they generated electricity. Such long timescales, high costs and high risks put off most private investors. But in 2022 the Nuclear Energy (Financing) Act changed this approach, allowing instead the use a Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model which shares risks more equally between investors, consumers and taxpayers. This allows investment in and revenue from smaller ‘blocks’ of development and construction, overseen by energy regulator Ofgem and the secretary of state.",
            "This week the government has also confirmed it will approve nuclear power for “green financing status” – allowing it to benefit from the green investment taxonomy and rulebook and incentivising more investors. At the same time the government is also reviewing the planning approval process for nuclear power sites to streamline this and ensure no undue delays. Going beyond these important individual policies and forming a detailed long-term nuclear strategy will be a vital role for the body that is now supposed to be spearheading this process – GBN.",
            "Getting set up for success",
            "At the heart of any successful major programme, from road and rail to water and energy, is a detailed approach that establishes clear end goals and works backwards through the strategic, technological and behavioural steps required to get there. This is particularly important for a UK nuclear programme as since the last new commercial reactor was completed in 1995 a lot of the skills and domestic supply chain that existed for commercial nuclear power has moved on. Achieving 24GW by 2050 is a gargantuan task – and to even contemplate it we need to plan how to rebuild that supply chain and skills network. Nuclear requires execution of a comprehensive industrial strategy.",
            "The good news is that the UK has a large pool of talent and relevant knowledge that can be easily brought across – from nuclear decommissioning programmes, defence work and research into nuclear energy across our innovation hubs in Oxbridge and beyond. The challenge is one of scaling up fast enough. Especially given that we should expect parallel development of new nuclear reactors alongside SMRs, and even nuclear fusion. The new coordinating force of GBN is welcome and badly needed to identify the skills gaps in the multi-decade long process.",
            "The decommissioning factor",
            "One important element for a nuclear revolution that is less often discussed is decommissioning – yet dealing with the outcomes of nuclear power is central to making the energy source viable. At a simple level this is due to confidence and long term planning: people will be happier approving and investing in new nuclear if they know there is a robust approach in place for dealing with waste and decommissioning the sites at the end of their useful lives.",
            "But it’s not just about the future – it’s about the present and the past. Existing nuclear sites are in prime locations for new reactors, and with all but one scheduled to close by 2030 – these will likely be the locations for the next generation of reactors too. Safe and efficient decommissioning will lay the groundwork for this, and build skills that can feed into future stages of development. The UK has strong decommissioning experience and skills – so let’s not let this important factor be forgotten or left out of core nuclear programme planning.",
            "This will be the challenge and the opportunity for GBN. We need this body to curate a fully-fledged and comprehensive “ecosystem” for nuclear in the UK. It must oversee the development of a programmatic approach and strategy in close collaboration with the industry and must take a coordinating role to consider new developments, technologies, skills, supply chains and decommissioning altogether.",

            "Investment in road maintenance",
            "were two of the headline announcements in yesterday’s spring budget announcement by chancellor Jeremy Hunt.",
            "Before outlining his investment plans, Hunt said that the UK would avoid recession in 2023 and his budget would set out plans for “long term, sustainable growth”. He added that the Office for Budget Responsibility expected the plans to more than deliver on prime minister Rishi Sunak’s commitment to halve inflation.",
            "“Inflation was at 10.7% at the end of 2022 and we expect it to fall to 2.9% by the end of this year,” said Hunt. This news has been welcomed by the construction sector which has seen the cost of projects soar, with some paused due to rising costs.",
            "In terms of policies that directly affect the civil engineering industry, Hunt announced that he would add £200M a year to the annual £500M already promised in 2021 to address pothole repairs.",
            "He also announced a reclassification of nuclear power as “environmentally sustainable” to put it at the same investment incentives as renewable energy projects. Hunt also backed nuclear innovation and said that the first focus for the new nuclear regulator, Great British Nuclear (GBN), will be to launch a competition to be concluded by the end of the year to promote development of small modular reactors (SMRs).",
            "“GBN will help to bring down costs across the supply chain and help nuclear provide 25% of our electricity by 2050,” said Hunt. On the subject of the SMR competition, he added: “If they are demonstrated as viable, then we will co-fund this exciting new technology.”",
            "Hunt also confirmed the funding for carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) that was announced at the start of the week.",
            "After transport minister Mark Harper announced two year delays to High Speed 2, Lower Thames Crossing and the A27 Arundel bypass, plus other roads projects, last week, Hunt’s only commitments on infrastructure came under the heading of the Levelling Up agenda.",
            "Hunt confirmed that there will be a third round of allocations under the Levelling Up Fund to come later this year where a further £1bn of investment is expected to be announced.",
            "In addition, Hunt revealed plans to establish 12 investment zones in the UK to support skills and infrastructure development. Of the 12 growth clusters across the UK, Hunt expects there to be four across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. “Each cluster will drive growth in key future sectors and bring investment to the local area. Each English Investment Zone will have access to interventions worth £80M over five years, including tax reliefs and grant funding,” he said.",
            "Hunt also used the spring budget to announce the roll out of new Levelling Up Partnerships, providing over £400M of investment in 20 areas across England. The government is also providing additional funding for local projects to encourage growth and support communities, including over £200M for 16 “high quality” regeneration projects.",
            "Two specific projects were also named in Parliament during Hunt’s budget speech – the Cloddach Bridge and Holyhead Breakwater.",
            "The government is providing £1.5M to Moray Council, subject to business case, to help fund repairs to Cloddach Bridge in Moray, Scotland. Meanwhile, to support the restoration of the historic Grade II listed Holyhead Breakwater at Holyhead Port, the government is providing £20M of funding to the Welsh Government. “This will ensure the long-term viability of this vital transport hub and trade links with the island of Ireland, as well as safeguard the hundreds of jobs this port supports in Wales,” Hunt explained in the budget documents.",
            "Although the budget made commitments on some infrastructure investment, some felt that Hunt failed to address the project delays announced last week and the impact that will have on growth.",
            "ICE director of policy Chris Richards said: \"The budget presented key ambitions for the UK that would help the country reach its levelling up and net zero goal, but little certainty. Major financing decisions have been postponed until after the next general election and are therefore subject to change.",
            "\"The UK debate on infrastructure needs a reality check. There is global competition for talent, resources, and know-how. Delaying major programmes like HS2 won’t result in cost reduction. In fact, the UK's ability to deliver projects effectively may become more difficult as construction firms shift their focus to other countries. We hope to see more concrete commitments to net zero infrastructure in the updated net zero strategy later this month.",
            "\"Certainty on project pipelines, not delay, is what is needed to keep costs down.\"",
            "Association for Consultancy and Engineering (ACE) CEO Stephen Marcos Jones said: “In the days leading to the budget, we issued a warning that the UK’s reputation for delivering large-scale construction and infrastructure projects is on the line, following the decision to delay construction of significant aspects of HS2 by two years. The focus on reducing inflation in the budget hopefully means a rethink to the delivery of major projects in the medium and long term.”",
            "Construction Plant-hire Association chief executive Kevin Minton said: “Following the announcements on the delay to HS2 last week, a budget for growth needs firm commitments from government on future infrastructure spending and projects. Proposals in the budget to create Great British Nuclear, while welcome, do not provide immediate comfort to the construction sector, given these plans are medium to long-term goals. However, we hope plans to provide the CCUS scheme with its £20bn fund could provide some level of confidence for infrastructure planning.”",
            "National Infrastructure Commission chair Sir John Armitt also welcomed the news on CCUS. He said: \"Government has set out a welcome programme of investment on a significant scale. This should help crowd in private investment and build a pipeline of CCUS projects that will play an important role in decarbonising the economy. We now need to get on with the award process as quickly as possible to ensure the UK regains pace in this internationally competitive sector. The Commission will continue its own work on the future infrastructure networks needed for CCUS and hydrogen technologies to underpin these emerging markets.”",
            "Nonetheless, while the investment plans were welcomed, many wanted to see firmer commitments to spending. Gleeds CEO Graham Harle said: “This budget was set against the backdrop of global uncertainty as well as a desire by the chancellor to pacify the disgruntled Tory right wing. It is a bit like trying to carry a delicate Ming vase coated in olive oil across an ice rink wearing stilettos. One false move and it’s all going to end up in a hundred pieces.",
            "“We wanted three things - help to alleviate critical labour shortages, guarantees on infrastructure spending, and tax incentives to impact carbon reduction refurbishment of residential and commercial buildings. What we got was promises of more enterprise zones, investment incentives for mini nuclear power projects and tax breaks for capital expenditure investment. These are all welcomed and admirable but long-term aspirations are not short-term fixes.”",
            "Atkins UK and Europe CEO Richard Robinson added: \"With a lot trailed in the last week or so, there were no major surprises but I am, of course, pleased to see an ongoing focus on high quality infrastructure as a catalyst for growth, in particular continued Levelling Up funding and progressing clean energy projects through the creation of Great British Nuclear and a commitment to invest in developing new technology including CCUS.",
            "\"That said, the government must now focus on two key enablers which will allow actual delivery on the ground, accelerate the net zero transition and improve productivity across the UK: streamlining the planning and consenting process; and providing a far clearer long-term view of investment priorities which will give businesses the direction needed to recruit, upskill and innovate with greater confidence.",
            "\"As such, the much-delayed National Infrastructure & Construction Pipeline – which sets out the public and private investment that will transform people’s lives for decades to come - needs to be published as soon as possible, noting that it was last updated in 2021.\"",
            "Aecom Europe and India chief executive Colin Wood said: “Reaching net zero and growing the economy sustainably are two of the most important challenges of our time and this budget took steps, not strides, to delivering this.",
            "“The commitment to 12 investment zones with a focus on research and innovation is a welcome start. Funding of £80M over five years will enable these zones to make some headway, but the successful stimulation of business investment is critical.",
            "“The £20bn investment in CCUS is an extremely exciting prospect for the sector and one which could achieve tangible positive change so we’re keen to see early progress.”",
            "Mineral Products Association chief executive Jon Prichard said: “The chancellor’s announcement on funding for CCUS is welcome and important for the UK’s cement and lime producers. But following on from last week’s announcement of infrastructure delays, this budget was a missed opportunity to address the longstanding challenges relating to the delivery of transport infrastructure projects and housing and the uncertainty that this creates.”",
            "Murphy group people director Dawn Moore also felt that Hunt could have gone further on his commitment to investing in skills. She said: “The government’s plans to plug the skills shortage that has blighted the sector for so long by allowing foreign workers easier entry into the country are much needed but are not a silver bullet in their own right – we need a plan that acknowledges the multi-faceted nature of the problem and encompasses everything from educational reforms and a revamped approach to apprenticeships.",
            "“Although we absolutely welcome moves such as the ramp up in investment in carbon capture projects and the intention to press ahead with selecting sites for a new generation of small modular nuclear reactors, delivering on projects such as these will only be possible if government helps the sector to urgently tackle the skills shortage.”",
            "Nonetheless, UK partner of law firm Womble Bond Dickson Simon Rowland said: “While the last 18 months have seen extreme volatility in materials pricing and shortages which has caused pain for contractors and clients alike, the loss to the sector of qualified and unqualified labour has been a constant drain on the industry for a number of years.",
            "\"We welcome the government's willingness to accept the Migration Advisory Committee's interim recommendations to add five key construction occupations to the Shortage Occupation List, which we hope will ease immediate pressures on an already strained sector. Obviously further work needs to be done in this area – but that is longer term requiring investment in apprentices, schools and retraining bodies to make the construction industry a more attractive and diverse place to work.\"",
            "Association of Project Management chief executive Adam Boddison said: “A healthy and stable economic environment is vital for the successful delivery of projects – especially those that are supporting government initiatives. And of course, people deliver projects, so having more people in the workforce will make it easier for project teams to recruit. We therefore welcome measures announced by the chancellor that support economic growth and tackle barriers people face when joining or re-joining the workforce.",
            "\"However, the most sustainable way to grow the economy is not merely by growing the size of the workforce, but by ensuring people have the skills and capabilities they need to succeed in areas like project management that bring financial benefits as well as social ones. We therefore urge the government to commit to investing in the skills necessary for delivering projects that will help the UK address challenges such as climate change, infrastructure improvement and digital transformation.",
            "“We would also have liked to have seen more detail on plans to address how post-Brexit supply chain issues might be addressed, as people in our profession tell us they’re concerned with the impacts of these issues on projects they’re working on.\""

            "Chancellor Jeremey Hunt has announced the government will be consulting on listing nuclear energy as “environmentally sustainable” in a bid to increase private investment in the sector.",
            "Announced during today’s Spring Budget statement, Hunt stated nuclear was a “critical source of cheap and reliable energy” to meeting the UK’s net zero obligations.",
            "On the reclassification of nuclear energy, government’s budget document states: “Nuclear energy will also be included in the green taxonomy, subject to consultation, encouraging private investment.”",
            "In his speech, Hunt said: “Because the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine, even under the conservatives, we will need another critical source of cheap, reliable energy and that is nuclear.",
            "“Increasing nuclear capacity is vital to meet our net zero obligations, so to encourage private sector investment into our nuclear programme, I confirm, subject to consultation, nuclear power will be classed as environmentally sustainable.",
            "“That will give an access to the same investment incentives as renewable energy and alongside that will come more public investment.”",
            "The change of classification has not been welcomed by Stop Sizewell C, a campaign group against the facility, which called the change a “nonsense of the science”.",
            "A spokesperson for Stop Sizewell C added: \"The chancellor announcing that nuclear will be included in the 'green' taxonomy makes a nonsense of the promised consultation and a nonsense of the science, given the major issue of radioactive waste. In any case this seems unlikely to sway wary UK investors, for despite government support, Sizewell C is not expected to reach a final investment decision for two years - if ever - and remains a risky project with a flawed reactor design.",
            "The announcement about the reclassification was made as part of the government's commitment to for Great British Nuclear (GBN) as a new industry body and Hunt said that the first focus of GBN will be to launch a competition to develop small modular reactor (SMR) projects.",
            "On the subject of SMRs, Hunt said in his budget speech: \"I am launching the first competition for Small Modular Reactors. It will be completed by the end of this year and if demonstrated to be viable, we will co-fund this exciting new technology.\"",
            "The competition seeking companies to develop SMRs was announced on 10 March by the newly formed GBN. This new government body has been set up as a delivery vehicle for all of the UK’s nuclear projects, including",
            "Current SMR projects include",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR proposals looking at constructing reactors in Oldbury and Berkeley in the south west of England",
            "Balfour Beatty's proposals with Holtec Britain to develop plans for a SMR-160 pressurised light-water reactor somewhere in the UK.",
            "A spokesperson for Rolls-Royce SMR said: “Rolls-Royce SMR has secured funding commitments of £490M and is the only SMR technology moving through the UKs regulatory process. We have over 600 members of staff in the UK, dedicated to bringing our technology to market at pace – a British solution to a global energy crisis.",
            "“Rolls-Royce SMR has called for rapid progress from the government and we welcome the adoption of that principle in this process, the launch of GBN and the certainty it will provide for future projects.",
            "“We look forward to working collaboratively with government and GBN to realise their ambitions as quickly as possible.”",
            "The official budget document states the competition “is expected to attract the best designs from both domestic and international vendors. The government’s ambition is to select the leading technologies by the end of this year and if demonstrated to be viable, co-fund this exciting new technology in the UK.”",

            "He said: “The chancellor has today given a vote of confidence in nuclear energy. The establishment of GBN – following my recent letter calling for it and on the back of evidence to our committee – will reassure the sector. I hope this is a sign that Wylfa may be given the green light sooner rather than later for a GW scale site.",

Its spokesperson added: \"There's woefully little information about GBN, or its financial clout, but the UK government's recent affirmation of how intertwined civil and defence 'nuclear enterprises' are and commitment to align these raises serious questions about GBN's role, and the government's previously unspoken motivations behind its civil nuclear ambitions.\"",
            "A spokesperson for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) said",
            "“Last year, the government announced that the NDA would support interested parties to enable engagement on land within the NDA estate which has the potential to host the UK’s next generation of nuclear power stations. This work is consistent with our mission to clean up the UK’s earliest nuclear sites safely, securely and cost-effectively and, in line with our obligation under the Energy Act, to release the land for other uses that benefit the local community and the environment.",
            "“Of course our primary focus is the decommissioning of existing nuclear facilities across the UK, but we also have an important role to play in supporting the UK government to achieve its energy security strategy ambitions and we will engage with GBN and other interested parties to help deliver this.”"

            "Hunt said in a statement that the UK is in need of a “reset” and part of the reason the government is keen to invest in cleaner energy is to stop a spike in household energy bills, like the one the UK faced following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",
            "He said: “We don’t want to see high bills like this again, it’s time for a clean energy reset. That is why we are fully committing to nuclear power in the UK, backing a new generation of small modular reactors, and investing tens of billions in clean energy through carbon capture.”",
            "The Treasury has said Hunt intends to announce an “unprecedented investment” of £20bn over the next 20 years for carbon capture and low carbon energy projects in response to Joe Biden’s $369bn (£306bn) of climate subsidies for the United States.",

            "The designs for Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C are deliberately very similar; doing so saves costs and allows re-utilisation of the supply chain, as well as know-how, ensuring a smoother roll out. Both of those sites are adjacent to pre-existing nuclear facilities. It is curious then that EDF submitted 1,001 documents as part of its Development Consent Order (DCO) application for Hinkley Point C but 4,378 documents for Sizewell C. The environmental statement for the former was 31,401 pages and for the latter 44,260 pages.",

            "True, despite attempts to replicate and standardise, there are local and environmental differences between the projects so we shouldn’t expect the numbers to be identical. Nonetheless, those numbers are stark and represent a clear shift to increasing demands on developers to produce more information as the work by",
            "What explains this? My colleague Angus Walker recently gave me a great metaphor which I am stealing for these purposes: the planning and environmental system is like a house party where the chatter and hubbub slowly increases, until you reach a point where it becomes difficult to hear anything at all. At that point someone needs to yell be quiet, and it goes down but then inevitably starts to rise again.",
            "With the impending dawn of, and urgent need for, multiple Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs), does UK planning and environmental assessment regime need this kind of reset? Perhaps, but instead of yelling “be quiet”, I think we should be politely saying “streamlining, siting, certainty” if we want an expeditious roll of out of low carbon technologies.",
            "On siting, developers are left somewhat bereft in the absence of clear site allocations for their projects. If press reports are to be believed, the new government body, Great British Nuclear (GBN), is currently held up in inter-governmental discussions. That body was no doubt intended to help clarify appropriate locations for specific projects. Without having particular sites allocated or agreed with government, it is more difficult for developers to begin their assessments, feasibility studies and engagement with the relevant local communities. Press reports of a 12 month delay are likely to cause concern so government should consider whether it can release some funding now to enable GBN to be established to undertake a siting strategy and potentially unlock a few projects, whilst acknowledging further functions and funding decisions are to come.",
            "On certainty, government should publish and make policies which support the delivery of SMRs and AMRs on any suitable sites, rather than relying on site specific allocations as it has for gigawatt developments. Bespoke National Policy Statements should explicitly acknowledge the need for standardisation in design and delivery so that current policy tests around alternatives or requirements do not slow down the celerity of an SMR “fleet” approach. Separately, there are proposals for “National Development Management Policies” which will have greater weight in local permissions – why not designate the British Energy Security Strategy as one of those policies to enable greater levels of certainty where experimental reactors below 50MW seek local permissions?",
            "On streamlining, government is consulting on \"quality standards\" which would reduce the timescales for nationally significant infrastructure projects. It is imperative that such quality standards do not simply shift timescales from the examination planning phase, to the pre-application and design phase. Assuming we want to genuinely minimise timescales, the quality standards should be carefully framed.",
            "The government’s proposed introduction of Environmental Outcome Reports to replace Environmental Impact Assessments also provides a useful “reset” moment, but again it should be established with clear principles that make clear proportionate information is required. There is much to learn from the transport sector as well, where bespoke central government discharges of secondary consents (i.e., those detailed approvals post-consent) have allowed for specialisation and standardisation. One recent transport project I worked on discharged all of its post-DCO requirements in 7 days.",
            "Horizon’s proposals at Wylfa Newydd were ultimately withdrawn, though we can see that the Inspectors on that project considered that the impact on a network of protected sites weighed heavily against granting the project. We do not know what the government would ultimately have decided, but it’s a fair bet that a refusal against a scheme which would have powered several million homes would be looked on with raised eyebrows at least with the benefit of hindsight following Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine.",
            "We need to avoid scenarios like that and appreciate that SMRs and AMRs are disruptive technologies that are urgently required. So much so, would there also be benefit from even more radical regulatory competition and regulatory “sandbox” approaches? John Fingleton",
            "a “n+1” regulator which would grant exemptions from complying with rules and laws for disruptive technologies (subject to obtaining some kind of public liability insurance). Given the relative low impacts of SMRs, this might be more palatable for those technologies.",
            "That idea, and all those above, are mere suggestions – but Wylfa, Hinkley and Sizewell are those at the planning and environmental regime house party, clamoring for a reset. We should listen and embrace an atomic awakening.",

This is a significant investment at the Westinghouse Springfields site in Lancashire safeguarding hundreds of highly skilled jobs in the northwest.",

            "Nuclear energy has been assigned a major role in the UK’s energy strategy. But the strategy will fail unless the government supports and enables the delivery of small nuclear reactors alongside faster construction of large reactors.",
            "Mark Liddiard is a senior consultant in Mott MacDonald’s nuclear business",
            "In April 2022 the UK government set out its ambition to quadruple UK nuclear power generating capacity to 24GW by 2050. That will meet approximately a quarter of electricity demand if it remains the same as today. It is part of a strategy to improve energy security and fulfil the legally binding commitment to reduce national emissions to net-zero.",
            "Then former prime minister Boris Johnson was reportedly frustrated by his chancellor Rishi Sunak’s determination to scrutinise the cost of new nuclear, which delayed the strategy’s publication. But scrutiny complete and the 24GW nuclear goal announced, in August Sunak declared himself a strong supporter of nuclear.",
            "Now Sunak has the top job, and he needs to convert verbal support into practical action. Only one of the UK’s existing nuclear reactors, Sizewell B, is scheduled to continue operating after 2028 – although the current energy crunch could lead to short life extensions for the Hartlepool and Heysham 1 reactors.",
            "By 2050, all the country’s nuclear electricity must be from new reactors. Building 24GW that fast will require an exceptional effort, embracing all available options.",
            "And the challenge may be far greater: as part of our study,",
            "The path to zero carbon heat",
            ", for the Net Zero Infrastructure Industry Coalition in 2018, we estimated that full electrification of the UK economy will require 400GW total electricity generation capacity.",
            "Jeremy Reed is the global nuclear practice lead at Mott MacDonald",
            "Hinkley Point C, currently under construction on the north Somerset coast, will provide 3.2GW of electricity from two pressurised water reactor (PWR) units. After a decade in planning, the project was approved for construction in 2016 and is now scheduled to enter operation in June 2027. An 8,000-strong workforce is being employed to build it, and the final construction bill is expected to be £27bn.",
            "The government has identified eight sites across the UK suitable for new reactors – all existing nuclear sites – but statutory consultations and approvals will be required. That phase of the project cycle should be shorter than for Hinkley Point C but will still take years.",
            "And building large-scale new nuclear power stations is slow, resource intensive and expensive. Hinkley Point C’s owner/operator will be French energy giant EDF. It anticipates that the Hinkley supply chain and workforce will transition to the next new build project, the 3.2GW Sizewell C in Suffolk, which will be to the same PWR design. EDF reckons that maintaining momentum, applying lessons learned and retaining skills will enable Sizewell C to be built 20% more efficiently.",
            "Yet, at that speed and if building new reactors sequentially, the UK can complete only three or at most four new power stations by 2050, falling far short of the targeted 24GW.",
            "An attraction of new nuclear projects is the opportunity to create new jobs and upskill people. However, the need for speed requires a bigger workforce, with perhaps three times the current number of skilled workers able to work on new nuclear projects. If the UK economy cools and workers are laid off in other industries, recruiting the required numbers may be possible. But if the employment market as a whole remains hot, the construction industry will face the same challenge it has done for decades already: attracting enough talent to deliver the pipeline of infrastructure projects. Competition for people could be a significant barrier to progress.",
            "The very scale of large nuclear projects is also problematic, causing severe distortions in local economies: housing, feeding, transporting and entertaining thousands of workers and supplying vast quantities of construction materials impacts communities both during and after construction. Impacts can be both good and bad – and must be carefully managed.",
            "Small modular reactor (SMR) technology should have an important role to play in reaching the 24GW goal. SMRs typically have an output of less than 300MWe, although Rolls-Royce is developing a 470MWe unit. Whereas the reactor designs of Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C must be built in situ, the companies developing SMR designs say they will be factory built and delivered to site as ‘plug-in’ modules. With less construction, the time from project start to operation will be much shorter. Rolls-Royce says that its first 470MWe plant could be built for £2.5bn, falling to £1.8bn as its ‘production line’ gets up to speed. Build time will be between three and five years.",
            "Rapid construction and a cost comparable to offshore wind per MWe of electricity generated are matched by other attractions. Many of the jobs created will be factory-based and able to tap existing manufacturing skills as the economy transitions from ‘old’ industrial technologies to new ones.",
            "SMRs can be installed alongside existing operational and decommissioned nuclear and coal fired power plants, dispatching electricity using transmission infrastructure already in place. With regulatory approval and community consent, SMRs could be installed locally to meet industrial or consumer demand without the need for long-distance transmission and associated energy losses. And SMR designs offer faster output regulation than large reactors, making them attractive for balancing variations in wind and solar power production, as well as a source of base load.",
            "However, to date, not one SMR has been completed anywhere in the world, so their promise is theoretical, not proven. In early November Rolls-Royce identified four priority sites in the UK, plus another four that are suitable, but no sites have yet been confirmed by government.",
            "American regulators approved a SMR design by NuScale in 2020 and Rolls-Royce’s design is inching through the process of safety verification. But globally, approving new SMR technology is painstaking and slow. It is expected that technology vendors will collaborate and produce merged designs to speed deployment. International collaboration between nuclear regulators could further accelerate the pace: The vision for SMR technology vendors is to be able to supply the same plant globally with multinational approval.",
            "At present the levelised cost of electricity (lifetime total cost divided by lifetime total production) for Hinkley Point C is forecast to be £106; £85 for Sizewell C; £65 for Rolls-Royce’s first SMR; and £53 for NuScale’s American SMR. The importance of decarbonising the energy system and building energy security mean that decisions about new nuclear energy can’t be made purely on cost: the UK requires large reactors and SMRs. If a pipeline of projects and a competitive supply chain can be created, the unit cost for both technologies should fall.",
            "But only when the first PWR and SMR plants have been delivered will the true capital and operational costs be known.",
            "The government can bring that point closer by:",
            "supporting the implementation of funding mechanisms to attract private capital – in July the European Union accepted nuclear as a sustainable technology, making it eligible for green finance",
            "streamlining consents, in particular at the front-end of the development consent order process – SMRs will not be economic if subject to the same consenting costs as large reactors",
            "collaborating with other nations to achieve a unified and proportionate regulatory framework, which will deliver safe, efficient and reliable technology on time and to cost",
            "identifying and confirming existing nuclear, coal and gas powered sites that can be re-powered with SMRs – to gain public acceptance proponents should consider using stakeholder engagement and consultation methodologies such as FUTURES, a scenario planning tool developed by Mott MacDonald with the University of the West of England",
            "finding a publicly acceptable solution for the long-term management of higher activity radioactive wastes – good progress has been made in Scandinavia; the UK is following a community-led approach to agree the site for a deep geological repository",

            "viewing nuclear power as an essential component of a net zero carbon energy system, working alongside renewables to balance the grid and produce green hydrogen.",
            "With an electricity grid originally designed around large power plants, the best solution for the UK will likely be four large reactors including Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C, and multiple SMRs aggregated to deliver gigawatts of electricity. It looks possible based on construction industry capacity and technological readiness. However, this mix is by no means assured. Government policy and practical support will determine what gets built and how fast.",

            "After screening recently retired and active coal plant sites, the study team identified 157 retired coal plant sites and 237 operating coal plant sites as potential candidates for a coal-to-nuclear transition. Of these sites, the team found that 80% are good candidates to host advanced reactors smaller than the gigawatt scale.",
            "A C2N transition could significantly improve air quality in communities around the country. The case study found that greenhouse gas emissions in a region could fall by 86% when nuclear power plants replace large coal plants, which is equivalent to taking more than 500,000 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles off the roads.",
            "It could also increase employment and economic activity within those communities. When a large coal plant is replaced by a nuclear power plant of equivalent size, the study found that jobs in the region could increase by more than 650 permanent positions. Based the case study in the report, long-term job impacts could lead to additional annual economic activity of US$275M (£239M), implying an increase of 92% tax revenue for the local county when compared to the operating coal power.",

The study results suggest tangible, economic value in C2N transition for entities that own CPPs. The cost savings estimated for the overnight capital cost are significant, especially when considering the total value of nuclear projects.\"",

As we move to a clean energy future, we need to deliver place-based solutions and ensure an equitable energy transition that does not leave communities behind.”",

            "A range of future energy options for the UK remain on the table following the shutdown of Hinkley Point B in Somerset earlier this week.",
            "The nuclear power plant was the UK's first Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor and, following a nine year construction period, has been operational since 1976. Over the last 46 years it has contributed about 3% of the UK's total power needs producing 311TWh - enough to meet the needs of every home in the UK for almost three years",
            "Its original switch-off date was planned by operator EDF for 2016, but careful management allowed it to run safely until Monday this week.",
            "Over the coming weeks and months, teams at Hinkley Point B will undertake major maintenance and improvement projects across the plant to get it ready for the next stage of its life, defueling. This process, expected to last around three to four years, involves removing the remaining nuclear fuel from the reactors and transporting it to Sellafield for storage.",
            "Once that work is complete EDF will hand the station to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority for the next step of its life, decommissioning.",
            "However, the closure creates a drop in the UK's nuclear energy capacity and comes at an already challenging time for energy security, with rising global energy prices provoked by surging demand after the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As such, the government published a new Energy Security Strategy in April -",
            "which sets out plans to boost nuclear energy, while also investing in wind, solar and hydrogen.",
            "So what are some of the energy options going forward?",
            "Before the shutdown of Hinkley Point B",
            "MPs had, in fact, called for a decommissioning delay for the UK’s ageing nuclear power stations",
            "to ensure energy security and ease energy price rises. That call came too late for Hinkley Point B but similar options are also being considered elsewhere. German chancellor Olaf Sholz said on Wednesday that it might be necessary to extend the life of the Germany's three remaining nuclear plants, currently set to close at the end of this year.",
            "In terms of future nuclear projects, the UK energy situation will not be helped in the short term by the recently-announced",

            "Overall, the plans set out in the government's Energy Security Strategy, which was published in April, envisage a significant acceleration of nuclear, with an ambition of up to 24GW by 2050 to come from this source of power. In total, this would represent up to around 25% of the country's projected electricity demand - and",
            "Hinkley Point C delivery director Nigel Cann has previously backed an increase in energy from nuclear power.",
            "Another option could be small modular reactors (SMRs), which are potentially faster to deploy than large scale nuclear.",

            "Energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has previously said he feels the energy crisis could make people more open to onshore windfarms.",
            "The strategy also outlines the aim to increase the UK’s current 14GW of solar capacity which could grow up to five times by 2035, and to double the government's ambition to up to 10GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030.",
            "The UK is considering how to put solar panels into space to boost energy reliability",

            "Several key trends for renewable energy producers were unveiled in the Met Office’s State of the UK Climate 2021 study.",
            "UK Energy Research Centre co-director Keith Bell said the key point from the data was the heavy fluctuation seen over time and by geographical location, meaning neither wind nor solar power could be relied on to consistently generate the electricity needed by the country. The University of Strathclyde professor pointed out that while nuclear power could play a part in meeting demand, it wasn't hugely flexible, and a method of storing and releasing energy was required to balance out the good and bad days for renewables.",
            "Mark Sommerfeld, head of power and flexibility at the Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology, agreed that energy storage was a critical part of meeting future power requirements. “The Met Office’s report demonstrates that the impacts of climate change are already being felt across the UK and that policy must focus equally on decarbonisation and adaptation,\" he said.",
            "\"This is especially true for our energy systems, where we will need a complete range of renewable energy solutions including solar, wind, bioenergy and energy storage to ensure a secure low carbon flexible system: one that can respond to both peaks in demand, as well as changing, and frequently more extreme, weather conditions.”"

            "“It’s going to be interesting to see how that plays out with communities as nuclear power plants are usually controversial. But as yet, no-one is sure how the public will feel about SMRs,” says Ralston.",
            "Shearwater Energy and NuScale Power are also developing a scheme to build a hybrid SMR-wind and hydrogen production plant at Wylfa. Shearwater chief executive Simon Forster points out that SMR technology has clear benefits that set it aside from large scale reactors, including cheaper energy.",

            "The Wylfa scheme also proposes construction of a data centre on the same site to take advantage of the availability and security of supply which a series of SMRs can offer.",
            "Few were surprised at targets for offshore wind power being significantly boosted in the Energy Security Strategy. It commits to increasing the pace of deployment by 25%, delivering up to 50GW of capacity by 2030. This will include 5GW from floating turbines similar to those in the world’s first floating offshore wind farm that was commissioned off the Aberdeenshire coast last year.",
            "ICE low carbon energy community advisory board chair Ian Parke agrees this strategy is sensible. “The prospects for offshore wind are absolutely massive and, in my opinion, the future is in floating turbine projects such as EDF’s Blyth 2 scheme off the coast of Northumberland.”",

            "Some movement may come on this, with the strategy committing to cut consent time from four years to one. But even with a shorter cycle, Neller points out that the largely European-based supply chain could also undermine timelines.",
            "“There is a big supply chain issue which needs addressing,” he says.",
            "“We need to attract investment in this sector in the UK, to reduce our reliance on imports of things like",

            "He points to incentives that encourage bidders to support local suppliers and manufacturers in the latest ScotWind leasing round as a good example of what could be done.",
            "But Forster believes that one of the biggest challenges is to improve the reliability of supply from wind farms. This can be done by building more floating wind farms along the Atlantic seaboard.",
            "“High pressure systems in the North Sea are becoming more frequent and can cause the capacity of its wind farms to drop from 13GW to 1GW in just 12 hours – the equivalent of one large power station going offline every hour. This makes it very difficult to plan,” Forster says.",
            "Floating turbines are the preferred choice due to the deep water [they can be located in without foundations] and because construction can be de-risked by building onshore and towing them into place during suitable weather windows.",
            "Hydrogen power was singled out for a major boost in the new Energy Security Strategy with a commitment to double its production to 10GW by 2030. At least half of this is expected to come from “green” hydrogen, which is hydrogen produced by electrolysis.",
            "The previous target capacity of 5GW was expected to be an 80%/20% split between “blue” and green hydrogen. Blue hydrogen is made by separating carbon dioxide and hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture used to reduce or eliminate carbon emissions.",
            "The production process for blue hydrogen is called steam methane reforming, which mixes natural gas with hot steam, in the presence of a catalyst. The chemical reaction creates hydrogen and carbon monoxide.",

            "Green hydrogen also has the advantage of being able to use wind power or other renewables for the electrolysis process. This produces hydrogren which can be stored to generate electricity.",
            "Creating a successful hydrogen economy in the UK relies on infrastructure for its storage and transport, and carbon emissions from power generation or industrial",

            "This eliminates the need to use even more energy to extract other waste gases.",
            "But Ralston says that despite the increased emphasis on green hydrogen, the government could still do more. “The European Union is being bold on green hydrogen; if we made a stronger commitment, we could be leading that pack,” she says.",
            "She points to ITM Power’s new Gigafactory in Sheffield, which opened last year. It is the world’s largest electrolyser production factory.",
            "ITM’s electrolysers produce green hydrogen based on proton exchange membrane technology. It uses renewable energy and water, oxygen and water vapour are the only byproducts. Increased automation and economies of scale at the plant will cut the cost of this technology.",
            "Battery storage is another potential solution to the unreliability of renewable sources, Parke suggests.",
            "“Battery technology is improving and I think we will see more of this,” he says.",
            "Ralston agrees, linking it to the increased emphasis on offshore wind.",
            "“It does provide flexible power but we need to find ways to store it – this is one of the parts that the strategy misses,” she says.",
            "Last year construction of a huge Gigaplant battery factory in Blythe, Northumberland began – a welcome move in this direction, Ralston adds.",
            "While the new energy strategy gave no explicit support for tidal power, other than making a passing reference to it, last year’s commitment to ring fence £20M of the Contracts for Difference funding for tidal stream projects could provide a boost to that part of the sector.",
            "The announcement coincided with Morlais Energy gaining planning permission and funding for its scheme off the coast of Anglesey – although the project will only create the infrastructure for technology providers to plug into.",
            "The MeyGen demonstrator project which has been operating since 2018 off the north east coast of Scotland has planning permission for almost 400MW of capacity, although its first phase currently only has four 1.5MW turbines in place.",
            "Neller argues that it is time to look again at tidal energy, given its significant and reliable generating capacity and the relatively short timescale for getting a scheme up and running.",
            "He points out that tidal range projects such as the lagoons proposed for the Mersey estuary and Swansea Bay could feed in anything from around 700MW to more than 1GW of power and could be deployed quite quickly.",
            "They are considered more likely to gain planning consent than barrages because their potential impact on the environment is lower.",
            "“I think we need to review the delivery model for tidal so that risk is shared fairly between the private and public sector – in a similar way to how it is applied to the nuclear sector,” Neller says.",
            "He also suggests there is a role for modular construction to bring the price down through repeatability.",
            "A huge range of schemes is being talked about, especially on the west coast of Britain, which has the second highest tidal range in the world. But many schemes are still only in the early stages of development, while others have fallen in and out of favour over the last decade.",
            "According to British Hydropower Association working group the Tidal Range Alliance, these schemes offer an achievable 10GW of installed capacity, which would deliver around 5% of UK energy use and there is scope to expand this capacity significantly.",
            "Among proposals to expand hydropower capacity are two schemes in Scotland. At Cruachan Dam in Argyll, Drax Group is seeking a £500M investment to build a new cavern at the 440MW power station.",
            "A second cavern and generation equipment would more than double this, potentially adding 600MW of capacity. A planning application is due this year but it will be at least 12 months before a decision is made.",
            "Meanwhile SSE Renewables is proposing a pumped storage scheme for Coire Glas above Loch Lochy in the Great Glen. It will be first large scale pumped storage scheme to be built in the UK for more than 30 years.",
            "The facility has a potential capacity of up to 1,500MW and initial bids from the four shortlisted firms tendering for the main civil engineering contract were due to be submitted in April. A final decision by SSE Renewables on whether to go ahead with the project is expected next year.",
            "It is clear that there are plenty of options to move the UK away from reliance on fossil fuels but industry leaders agree that decisions must be made soon if security is to be delivered and carbon net zero targets are to be"

            "The start date for the Unit 1 reactor at the Somerset power station will be pushed back to June 2027, with the cost now sitting at £25bn to £26bn, an increase on the previous £23bn figure.",
            "This is due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, time needed to adapt the reactor design for UK regulations and excess costs for marine works.",
            "Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) senior analyst Jess Ralston said that considering",
            "the delays EDF has experienced in France with its Flamanville 3 nuclear project",
            "- which uses the same European Pressurised Reactor design as the Hinkley Point C project and planned Sizewell C plant - it is \"not really a surprise\" to see Hinkley delayed.",
            "But what exactly does the news mean for the UK nuclear industry and the energy supplies of the country?",
            "Although the start of electricity generation for Unit 1 is now targeted for June 2027, EDF has said that the risk of further delay of the two units is assessed at 15 months, assuming the absence of a new pandemic wave and no additional effects of the war in Ukraine.",
            "As such, Ralston said that in terms of energy supplies \"we'll not know really what the situation will be until closer to the time\" but she does feel that the delay strengthens the case for renewables, which are \"quicker, easier and cheaper\" to get up and running and provide a more secure investment return.",
            "\"The case for renewables now, for me, is so overwhelming,\" she said. \"I can see this being a catalyst for investment into those sorts of power systems over nuclear which is just getting more unattractive by the month.\"",
            "However Ralston added that a nuclear \"backbone\" is still needed and the government has, for example, said",
            "it wants to build eight new plants by 2030",
            "- but making the economic case for this may now become more challenging.",

            "ECIU head of analysis Simon Cran-McGreehan also previously told",
            "that EDF was considering such options.",
            "“Given that Hinkley’s already been delayed several times, the power industry is wise to the fact that it can’t be relied upon in the short term to turn up as expected,” he said. “I know that EDF is looking at whether it can extend the lifetime of the existing nuclear fleet to try and bridge that gap before Hinkley comes online.”",
            "EDF is hoping its Hinkley Point C project will provide a blueprint for the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk",
            "- so any delay to Hinkley is likely to have a knock on impact here.",
            "Ralston explained: \"The plan was to use learnings from Hinkley to make Sizewell C quicker and cheaper but if Hinkley carries on being delayed its difficult to see how Sizewell won't be delayed because it's the learnings that will be passed on.",
            "\"There is hope they will learn from Hinkley and be able to do things quickly and easily but with the funding model being different in future projects it puts a whole new spin on who is paying. If the public find out there are delays and cost overruns they won't be happy.\"",
            "In addition, EDF's plan has been for Hinkley employees to move across to work on the proposed Sizewell project, which has been described as Hinkley Units 3 and 4.",
            "Concerns have already been raised that Hinkley workers may be lost to other projects unless Sizewell can progress without delay,",
            "and it remains to be seen if the delay to the Hinkley construction schedule would mean a shortage of workers for Sizewell.",
            "When it comes to the proposed Wylfa Newydd power station on Anglesey, this is still in the early stages and Ralston said developers \"probably time to consider their options more but with Hinkley they've invested so much they sort of have to see it through\".",

            "What’s more, people understand that not all projects that help achieve net zero are themselves net zero. But we need to be honest with them from the outset and tell the whole story, not just the version we’d like it to be.",
            "What is over as far as the public are concerned is silence on the climate emergency. The public expects a credible story about a project's impact on the environment. Even if a project is seen as 'bad news' in simple terms, people want to understand it. Avoiding this only leads to a breakdown in trust. Without trust, projects will not earn the credibility they need to engage stakeholders, politicians, journalists, and the public.",
            "Communicating only to those impacted sets up the wrong type of conversation",
            "Here’s a scenario. You receive a letter that says ‘Project A’ is proposed near where you live. It may not improve your personal quality of life in a direct way. It’s the first time you’ve heard about it. You may vaguely know of the developer. They tell you there is a need case which addresses ‘Problem B’ and will deliver ‘Benefits C’ which they will be consulting you about. You are likely part of a relatively small audience in the context of who this project affects.",
            "It's human nature to be unconvinced, opposed or at best, needing more information before forming a view.",
            "Take a second scenario. You’ve heard that ‘Problem B’ is on the horizon, but interventions like ‘Project A’ offer the solution, and will deliver societal benefits. You hear this from governments at all levels and from sources who are responsible for these problems. You’ve also heard this from sources you determine to be credible. You also know that ‘Problem B’ will take time and involve many moving parts. And much of the country is going to play a part in solving it.",
            "While you are hearing this story, so are many millions more.",
            "By the time you hear about ‘Project A’, you may not like the proposal, but your awareness of why it is needed, and the role it plays, is greater.",
            "The social proof that’s already been deployed supports part of your view.",
            "Include the public from the start",
            "Projects will always be seen as ad-hoc unless they are explained as part of coherent economic and climate strategy. Without the context and narrative, each project will be required to explain its own purpose, while its perception is left to how each is communicated. The risk this leaves is a lack of progress while societal challenges remain unaddressed.",
            "Explaining projects as part of a wider strategy presents a real opportunity for government, too. Pointing to tangible projects brings meaning to national strategies for the public, which in turn boosts positive narratives about government direction and instils that all-important public trust.",
            "To drive a campaign that seeks to de-risk infrastructure and boost its support to deliver the projects we need, a concerted effort is required from industry and government. Or, at the very least, we need to make sure we consider broad audience base that includes those who stand to benefit from investment, not just those who may be impacted.",

            "The UK now needs a \"credible plan\" to deliver its energy aims, following yesterday's publication of the Energy Security Strategy.",
            "which sets out plans to boost nuclear energy, while also investing in wind, solar and hydrogen",
            "- comes as a result of rising global energy prices, provoked by surging demand after the pandemic as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",
            "Now that it has been revealed, experts have emphasised the importance of ensuring its proposals can be delivered and the need to move things forward quickly.",
            "“The UK’s energy targets are increasingly ambitious, and deadlines for delivery are brought ever-nearer, yet a credible plan is equally pressing to ensure the build rate of infrastructure matches the pace required to achieve these goals,\" said Atkins nuclear & power EMEA managing director Chris Ball.",
            "\"The urgency of this plan, underpinned by sustained policy, cannot be over-stated.\"",
            "Similarly Institution of Civil Engineers director of policy Chris Richards stressed that \"it is key that we swiftly see policy turn into action or there will be no change\", while BDB Pitmans partner Angus Walker highlighted the ambiguous nature of the strategy, which he said is \"at odds with net zero and urgency\".",
            "\"Fracking and North Sea oil extraction are back on the table and onshore wind, the fastest and cheapest type of renewable electricity, continues to be discouraged because of outdated views of its costs and acceptability,\" he said.",
            "\"While encouraging on offshore wind, hydrogen, solar and electricity networks, the strategy is full of statements of intent (it says ‘we will’ 49 times) but there is little on when or how the government will implement the aspirations.”",
            "Overall, the strategy aims to wean Britain off expensive fossil fuels, which are subject to volatile gas prices set by international markets, and boost diverse sources of homegrown energy for greater energy security in the long-term. It could see 95% of electricity by 2030 being low carbon.",
            "Ball added that the plans should be delivered in \"the most cost-effective way to ensure affordability is prioritised as much as sustainability and security of supply\".",
            "He said: \"This will partly be achieved by the coordination of a holistic plan, as recognised in",
            "the announcement of a Future System Operator to oversee the transformation of the UK’s energy system.",
            "\"Efficiencies can also be found in a fleet approach to new nuclear, ensuring supply chains deliver both large and small nuclear plants in the most cost-effective way. The creation of a new government body for nuclear could help to coordinate the roll-out of new projects to ensure this.\"",
            "Meanwhile, Turner & Townsend UK managing director Patricia Moore said that the government has \"presented an ‘everything’ plan with all energy options back on the table\" - but this in itself poses a challenge.",
            "“The challenge with an ‘everything’ plan is working out where to start – and critically how the funding and phasing will be organised for the pipeline of major projects that are being promised,\" she said.  \"Now we have the strategy, government and business must create an integrated, cross-industry programmatic approach with the right controls and oversight in place to deliver net zero infrastructure and investment in clean energy technology at pace and scale.”",
            "Moore added that \"initiatives like new nuclear require huge investment that is only possible if there is sufficient commitment, clarity and certainty on the forward programme stretching way beyond single election cycles\".",
            "The strategy will increase the number of clean jobs in the UK, supporting 90,000 jobs in offshore wind by 2028 (30,000 more than previously expected) 10,000 jobs in solar power by 2028 (almost double previous expectations) and 12,000 jobs in the UK hydrogen industry by 2030 (3,000 more than expected).",
            "WSP head of energy Fiachra Ó Cléirigh said that these new jobs are crucial.",
            "“Deliverability with skills, resource and supply chains already stretched is a rate limiting critical factor,\" he said. \"Support for over 40,000 more jobs in clean industries will significantly aid the growth of the UK’s green economy and enable communities across the country to benefit from the many opportunities our energy transition will provide.”",
            "According to Association for Consultancy and Engineering chief executive Stephen Marcos Jones, the workforce is ready to go.",
            "“Be it wind, solar, hydrogen or nuclear energy, our members are critical to the successful delivery of complex infrastructure projects,\" he said. \"They stand ready to work in close partnership with government in the creation and design of a more secure, and less carbon intensive, domestic energy system.\"",
            "Aecom senior vice president - energy Jeff Woodward",
            "“At last, industry has a clear framework on which to focus investment and accelerate implementation. As we have seen with the current energy crisis, boosting the UK’s energy independence is vital for protecting our economy from future market shocks. It is therefore encouraging to see support for a mix of clean energy solutions in today’s much-anticipated Energy Security Strategy.",
            "“Scaling up offshore wind, which is relatively quick to get up and running, is welcome news and will play an important role in boosting renewable supply in the short term. The aim to double low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 using excess offshore wind power is also a positive move. One of hydrogen’s most appealing qualities is its ability to act as a store for electricity production, which would fill gaps in renewable energy supply. Boosting its production is a significant signpost from government that it recognises the long-term value of green hydrogen.",
            "“Importantly, today’s energy measures should be coupled with a commitment to tackle energy efficiency. Improving energy efficiency across the UK’s building stock also has a critical role in delivering energy security and reaching net zero.",
            "“The focus now must be on delivery and we cannot afford to lose momentum. Government will need to build confidence, establishing the right financial and operational climate to enable industry to step up and deliver.”",
            "Civil Engineering Contractors Association director of operations Marie-Claude Hemming",
            "“The plans announced by the UK government today are only ambitious in that they rise to the challenge facing the nation in terms of energy security in a rapidly changing world. The changing geopolitical situation caused by Russia’s war against Ukraine underlines the need for the UK to be energy-secure, but this must only be done in the context of the imperative to achieve net zero and rise to the climate challenge.",
            "“We are particularly glad to see that the UK government is placing a renewed emphasis on new nuclear power, with the creation of a new government body ‘Great British Nuclear’, which will be set up immediately to bring forward new projects, backed by substantial funding, and the launch of the £120M Future Nuclear Enabling Fund later this month.",
            "“CECA has long argued that new nuclear must be an important part of the UK’s future energy mix, which must be based on a mixed portfolio of generation in order to keep the lights on and sustain our low-carbon future.",
            "Furthermore, the government’s strategy will create thousands of highly-skilled jobs across the country, to the wider benefit of the economy as a whole. CECA members stand poised to deliver on the UK Government’s plans for a secure, low-carbon energy future, and we look forward to working with them, government at all levels, and all other stakeholders to realise this ambitious vision in the months and years ahead.”",
            "National Infrastructure Commission chair Sir John Armitt",
            "“The government should be credited with its scale of ambition to expand offshore wind and solar generation. The challenge is to take these stretching targets and turn them into delivery of cheaper electricity into people’s homes as quickly as possible.",
            "“The steps on onshore wind are unlikely to unlock significant new capacity rapidly, while government’s aim to build more major nuclear plants will also take many years to realise.",
            "“Alongside shifting supply away from fossil fuels, some of the quickest wins can be found in improving energy efficiency by better insulating our homes and public buildings to cut overall demand. The potential benefits are now bigger than ever, and we again call on government to set out a costed, long term plan for meeting its own targets and help households make the right choices for their pocket and the planet.”",
            "Federation of Master Builders chief executive Brian Berry",
            "“The Energy Security Strategy completely misses the mark in tackling energy consumption in our homes. After the disappointment of the Heat and Buildings Strategy this was an opportunity for government to implement a National Retrofit Strategy, focussing on improving the energy efficiency of the UK’s draughty and leaky homes.",
            "\"While the strategy does deliver 0% VAT on energy efficiency improvements to properties, a welcome move that the FMB has long been campaigning for, this only helps those with the money to pay in the first place. A broader, insulation led, retrofit strategy would have been an immediate solution to reduce energy consumption, boost the economy and importantly, help save homeowners money on their bills during a cost-of-living crises.”",
            "Hydrock energy sector lead and Nuclear Industry Council member Peter Sibley",
            "“It’s no surprise, and very reassuring, that BEIS is launching an Energy Security Strategy given recent geopolitical events and fears surrounding the UK’s domestic energy supplies. From the war in Ukraine to rising wholesale energy costs, energy security should be a top priority for the government, alongside the development of a diverse, decarbonised energy infrastructure portfolio that allows the UK to reach its ambitious net zero targets.",
            "“Nuclear is rightly being placed as a central part of our future energy infrastructure. It’s great to see the sector positively portrayed as an integral part of the solution, particularly as other European countries, such as Germany, have begun to phase out its use. The UK has an opportunity to lead the way with a diverse portfolio of complementary energy infrastructure, combining firm nuclear derived energy with weather-dependent renewables, which together offer supply security, low carbon credentials and long-term price competitiveness.",
            "“However, to deliver the government’s new strategy, nuclear development needs to take place at all scales - from gigawatt scale developments such as Sizewell C, through to small and advanced modular reactors of various designs. The aspirational targets to generate 15GW of electricity from nuclear capacity by 2035 and provide 25% of all energy by 2050 really shines light on the level work required. Collaboration between the government, industry and investors is crucial, to establish the right conditions for successful implementation.",
            "“But this clear intent to increase our nuclear capabilities, with several new plants being constructed by the middle of the century, is something that should excite us all – it’s a great starting point for delivering a future-proofed energy portfolio for the UK”."

            "This will support the strategy's plans which envisage a significant acceleration of nuclear, with an ambition of up to 24GW by 2050 to come from this source of power. In total, this would represent up to around 25% of the country's projected electricity demand.",
            "Hinkley Point C delivery director Nigel Cann has previously backed an increase in energy from nuclear power.",
            "With the gradual winding down of UK nuclear plants, according to Cann only 10% of the country’s energy will be nuclear by the end of the decade, provided by Hinkley and Sizewell B. This used to sit at around 20% and he feels that it would be beneficial to return to these levels.",
            "“Our view is if you can get to 20%+ of energy in the UK generated by nuclear then at least you’re back to where you started and renewables have only really got to replace the coal and gas,” he told",
            "“If you had three Hinkley-sized plants at Wylfa, Hinkley and Sizewell C that would be fantastic start. Who knows whether SMRs will play a part but at the minute there’s no credible technology that somebody could build.”",
            "This month, the government is also establishing a new Future Nuclear Enabling Fund of up to £120M.",
            "It will provide targeted support for new nuclear and make it easier for new companies to enter the market.",
            "This follows the Nuclear Energy (Financing) Act which received Royal Assent last week",
            "- important news for all prospective nuclear projects. The Act will enable use of the Regulated Asset Base funding model for new nuclear projects, which will unblock obstacles to developing these projects and cut the cost of financing them.",
            "In the strategy, the government said it will work to progress a series of projects as soon as possible this decade, including Wylfa site in Anglesey. This could mean delivering up to eight reactors, equivalent to one reactor a year instead of one a decade.",
            "As set out in the 2021 Spending Review, up to",
            "£1.7bn of funding is available to support approval of at least one new nuclear power plant this Parliament.",
            "Wylfa had previously been in the running as a potential site for a large-scale nuclear power plant, but the decision was taken to push forward with Sizewell C in Suffolk instead.",
            "Now it looks like both could be on the table.",
            ", sources have said Johnson is determined to press ahead with plans for a large scale nuclear plant at Wylfa, with the government in talks with US nuclear reactor manufacturer Westinghouse and engineering firm Bechtel about a",
            "proposal to develop the site",
            ". The government has so far set aside £120M to support the project.",
            "The government's strategy also said \"constructive negotiations\" have been ongoing regarding the Sizewell C project in Suffolk since January 2021, as the most advanced potential project in the UK. If approved Sizewell C would be a replica of Hinkley Point C, providing electricity for 6M homes, and creating thousands of high value jobs nationwide.",
            "In January the government provided £100M of funding",
            "for the Sizewell C developer to invest in the project to help bring it to maturity, attract investors, and advance to the next phase in negotiations.",
            "In addition, last month it was revealed that the government is set to take a 20% stake in Sizewell C.",
            "Subject to technology readiness from industry, Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) will form a key part of the nuclear project pipeline, according to the strategy.",
            "The Advanced Nuclear Fund  includes up to £210M announced in November 2021 for Rolls-Royce to develop the design for one of the world’s first SMRs. This could be deployed in the UK in the early 2030s to turbocharge UK nuclear capacity.",
            "Rolls-Royce is also keen on using the Wylfa site to install its small nuclear reactors. Last month,",
            "the company submitted SMR designs for Wylfa and Trawsfynydd for assessment.",
            "However extensive safety checks are needed and these are not expected to come online until the 2030s. As such, the engineering giant has appealed to government to speed up the planning process.",

            "Last Energy has plans to spend £1.4bn on 10 reactors by the end of the decade, and the company has identified a site in Wales for its first power plant which it wants to build by 2025. Last Energy's reactors are smaller than Rolls-Royce's, forecast to cost £50M, and Last representatives are believed to have told Whitehall officials that its plants will be up and running years before Rolls-Royce.",
            "50GW offshore wind by 2030",
            "The strategy sets out a new ambition of up to 50GW of energy to come from offshore wind by 2030 – more than enough to power every home in the UK.",
            "This will be underpinned by new planning reforms to cut the approval times for new offshore wind farms from four years to one year and an overall streamlining which will radically reduce the time it takes for new projects to reach construction stages while improving the environment.",
            "Business and energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has previously emphasised the importance of easing planning procedures for onshore wind",
            "- and it looks like this will be applied to offshore projects too.",

            "Up to 5GW from floating offshore wind in deeper seas",
            "The government has also said it would like to see up to 5GW of its 50GW offshore wind target coming from floating offshore wind in deeper seas.",
            "The government will be consulting on developing partnerships with a limited number of supportive communities who wish to host new onshore wind infrastructure in return for guaranteed lower energy bills.",
            "Kwarteng has previously said he feels the energy crisis could make people more open to onshore windfarms.",
            "“There were quite understandable political reasons that people didn’t want to see large scale, onshore winds in their vicinity,\" Kwarteng said.",
            "\"I think that’s changed. I think people are much more open to renewable energy. And I think they realise that that’s part of the answer [to] Putin and other countries controlling oil and gas – you want to get energy independence.”",
            "The strategy outlines the aim to increase the UK’s current 14GW of solar capacity which could grow up to five times by 2035, consulting on the rules for solar projects, particularly on domestic and commercial rooftops.",
            "The government will aim to double its ambition to up to 10GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030, with at least half coming from green hydrogen and utilising excess offshore wind power to bring down costs.",
            "This will not only provide cleaner energy for vital British industries to move away from expensive fossil fuels, but could also be used for cleaner power, transport and potentially heat.",
            "Prime minister Boris Johnson emphasised that the strategy sets out \"bold plans to scale up and accelerate affordable, clean and secure energy made in Britain, for Britain\".",
            "He said: \"This will reduce our dependence on power sources exposed to volatile international prices we cannot control, so we can enjoy greater energy self-sufficiency with cheaper bills.\"",
            "Kwarteng added: \"We have seen record high gas prices around the world. We need to protect ourselves from price spikes in the future by accelerating our move towards cleaner, cheaper, home-grown energy.",
            "\"The simple truth is that the more cheap, clean power we generate within our borders, the less exposed we will be to eye watering fossil fuel prices set by global markets we can’t control.",
            "\"Scaling up cheap renewables and new nuclear, while maximising North Sea production, is the best and only way to ensure our energy independence over the coming years.\"",
            "Other plans in the strategy include a licensing round for new North Sea oil and gas projects planned to launch in the Autumn and a Heat Pump Investment Accelerator Competition to be run in 2022."

More than 1M.t of rock would be excavated to create the cavern and other parts of the power station. The existing upper reservoir, which can hold 2.4bn gallons of water, has the capacity to serve both power stations.",
            "What is pumped storage hydro?",
            "Pumped storage hydro is a large-scale method of storing energy that can be converted into hydroelectric power. The long-duration storage technology has been used for more than half a century to balance demand on Great Britain’s electricity grid and accounts for more than 99% of bulk energy storage capacity worldwide.",
            "It requires two reservoirs based at different altitudes but located close to each other.",
            "At Cruachan, these are Loch Awe and Cruachan Reservoir and they are located the minimum required distance from one another with a maximum elevation drop making it an ideal location.",
            "When there is excess power on the grid and demand for electricity is low, the power is used to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir using reversible turbines. When demand is high, the water is released downhill into the lower reservoir, driving the turbines the other direction to generate electricity.",
            "Pumped storage hydro plants can also provide ancillary services to help balance the power system, such as inertia from spinning turbines, which ensures the system runs at the right frequency and reduces the risk of power cuts.",
            "The proposed new power station would be the largest energy infrastructure project in Scotland for decades, more than doubling the station’s capacity for generating electricity and supporting around 900 jobs.",
            "It would also be able to store power from wind farms when supply outstrips demand. This is achieved by using reversible turbines to pump water from Loch Awe to the upper reservoir. The stored water is then be released back through the turbines to generate power quickly when demand increases.",
            "This would cut energy costs by reducing the need for wind farms to be paid to turn off when they are generating excess power.",

            "With growing Parliamentary support for the Nuclear Energy Bill, which will help with financing new power stations in Britain, now is the time for nuclear. However, with numerous major infrastructure projects running in parallel, the pressing question remains: how do we create the pipeline of talent needed to regenerate our country’s nuclear capabilities in line with net zero aspirations?",
            "Andy Oldham is business unit director for Defence, Nuclear, Energy and Utilities at Mace",
            "Many people may be surprised to learn that currently, the UK’s nuclear fleet supplies around 20% of our country’s electricity and 40% of its clean electricity.",
            "A central pillar in the fight against climate change, nuclear is a proven source of low carbon electricity, which has quietly powered our homes, industry and businesses, come rain, wind or shine, over the past six decades.",
            "Fast scaling up the political agenda in the face of the current energy crisis and volatile price movements, nuclear is a proven technology which ticks all the required boxes, thanks to its reliability and cost effectiveness.",
            "With the UK having one of the most closely regulated nuclear power systems in the world, it is both safe and secure. An ideal energy source for such a densely populated and land restricted country, it is understandable why nuclear is increasingly being recognised for its importance in our future clean energy mix.",
            "With Hinkley Point C, which is due to commission in the mid-2020s, set to deliver 71,000 jobs through supply chain alone, the clean growth potential of this sector is exponential, linking to the wider levelling up agenda and Covid-19 recovery.",
            "However, with the UK’s existing plants due to cease generating by the end of 2030, the economic stimulus programme to ‘Build Back Better’, alongside our nation’s fast-growing energy requirements, now is the time to scrutinise whether we have the capabilities needed to deliver on our closely fused nuclear and net zero ambitions.",
            "The current renaissance in nuclear follows a two decade pause in delivery.",
            "Now, with major programmes ongoing, including Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C, alongside plans for Small Modular Reactors, fusion reactor research, and a not so insignificant decommissioning programme, there is a requirement to revitalise the nuclear workforce to reinstate the UK as sector world-leaders.",
            "However, nuclear, which is set to deliver some of the UK’s most important and ground-breaking construction projects, faces an ever-growing skills gap - a challenge which needs addressing now.",
            "Compounded by Brexit and an aging domestic workforce, it is much harder to access the specialist and skilled workers needed to deliver new nuclear capacity. As is true for the wider infrastructure sector, there are thousands of exciting, stable and well-paid jobs to be had – but not enough people to fill them.",
            "As such, the UK is at risk of being left to wider market forces, which could result in inflated labour costs, undermining the feasibility of critical infrastructure projects. This may well lead to difficult decisions being made, as seen in Germany, where the elimination of nuclear has led to a growing reliance on power from coal plants. Carbon emissions increases through such means is both a political and environmental no-go.",
            "It is undeniable that a greater level of proactive state and market intervention is therefore required.",
            "A quantum leap in the right direction would be to establish an industry and government-led programme to focus on developing a skills pipeline, not just for nuclear and net zero, but other major projects too.",
            "A centralised programme management approach would allow for the improved and consistent phasing of major projects - meaning that important energy, transport and housing schemes would no longer have to compete as stubbornly for resource.",
            "With the ambition of delivering 40 new hospitals across England by 2030, the government already seems to be establishing a more cohesive methodology towards healthcare delivery, coordinating amongst local trusts and resources, bringing forward improvements to patient care.",
            "In the case of nuclear, we could see a similar approach applied across the distribution of best practice and relevant skillsets, with resource allocated according to programmed project requirements. This would result in improved outcomes, achieved by getting the right people on board, at the right time.",
            "The development of a Nuclear Delivery Programme Management Office (PMO) would provide a reliable and measurable flow of information to the sector, informing how and when projects are delivered.",
            "Supported by data collection and careful and detailed reporting, the PMO function would establish ‘one version of the truth’, creating a springboard for swift action, whilst identifying where elements of the existing workforce could be reskilled and redeployed. This would drive both jobs creation and net zero growth.",
            "This knowledge would better direct the development and deployment of STEM outreach, as well as training and apprenticeship opportunities, creating a pipeline of diverse, informed and engaged people. Working on this grassroots basis, more people would be made aware of the benefits of working within nuclear, which speaking from personal experience, provides a highly rewarding, exciting and meaningful career path.",
            "As an industry, we are well versed in solving highly complex project challenges, using ever more innovative solutions. It is now time to umbrella this thinking across all major project delivery.",
            "Together, with the support of government, we can ensure that the country is best placed to deliver vital projects and programmes, on time and to budget, all whilst providing social legacy en route to net zero.",
            "To me, this seems a path very much worth taking!",

            "Given the economic impact of Covid19, investors, businesses and consumers alike may currently find it hard to take anything other than a short-term perspective when making decisions about investing, purchasing or when designing policies. However, as the world gathers to craft a response to an even bigger issue – climate change – it’s clear that a longer-term view is needed.",
            "Filippo Gaddo is head of economics at Arup",
            "The net zero commitments and actions that will flow from COP26 are likely to converge and redefine economic innovation – resetting the landscape in which investment decisions are taken. I can see four distinct strands that will become the shared texture of future investments that produce long-term returns: technical, financial, social and policy innovation. To succeed, investors will need to make decisions in the light of all four priorities at once.",
            "For both investors and customers, a clear and credible pathway must be established to gain support for some of the changes net zero will involve. Issues like potential increases in energy costs or the ending of fossil fuel vehicles are both personal and political, as well as environmental and technological.",
            "Investors will need to back solutions that demonstrate clear “whole system” thinking. No single low carbon energy source will be a solution in isolation, and an attractive collective alternative to traditional methods is needed to garner support. Given that net zero represents a massive, system level change, investors will want to see innovation that tackles the goal in an integrated way.",
            "Meeting net zero goals is about more than technology development and purchases. It will require a new level of business management, improved operational processes, a more rigorous use of data analysis and better tools for decision making. In parallel, innovation in government regulation and policy will also play a critical role, as new markets and incentives are created.",
            "Net zero will also reframe roles and responsibilities within a more sustainable economic model. This is likely to result in “social innovation”, where we see greater civic empowerment and involvement in decision making, as societies become more conscious of the necessary changes.",
            "These innovation threads will likely be joined by increased financial innovation, as the market develops and offers new instruments and mechanisms to manage risks and lower the capital cost of new infrastructure.",
            "While the scale of the challenge is new, this is not totally unprecedented – as shown by the incredible growth of offshore wind power. A combination of these different types of innovation was behind the dramatic fall in prices in the industry, with projects coming online between now and 2030 producing power at an average cost of less than £50 per megawatt-hour over the course of their lifetime, compared to around £160 per megawatt-hour just a decade ago.",
            "Evidence shows that innovation and investment is not spontaneously environmentally friendly: a coordinated set of policies and institutions is required to shift the trajectory of economies towards clean innovation and investment. A clear, long-term vision must be communicated by governments to attract major investment into green energy.",
            "Net zero deadlines are going to be tough to meet, so there is no time to waste. Building momentum in new sectors means looking at strategy, policy, frameworks, and delivery before deciding whether a market can be established. The capital expenditure and operational costs of any project must be fully understood and financially sustainable processes developed to attract the right levels of investment.",
            "For those willing to tackle these challenges, there are a range of investment opportunities across different technologies. In countries where offshore wind is already deployed, options to push the technology frontier are still available from increasing blade size to floating offshore windfarms to adding hydrogen production.",
            "Similarly, developing whole system solutions that combine multiple renewable technologies with flexibility and storage solutions is another opportunity – these could be solar farms with battery on site or linking onshore renewables with hydrogen. Next, hydrogen itself is a key innovation frontier in the energy sector that will provide some of the largest opportunities across Europe, in the UK in particular due to the geological and energy system conditions.",
            "There are other solutions that are currently farther from deployment, but if deployed at scale would offer significant opportunities for a country that were to develop and export the technology and the business model to finance it. These include small modular/advanced nuclear reactors; tidal energy; and large scale deep geothermal energy. More research and testing is required, but the prize is large.",
            "None of the technologies mentioned can be delivered at scale without adopting a whole system approach and rethinking existing policy, regulation and commercial frameworks. It will only be by taking an approach like this that any green energy alternatives could become a working reality in the timescales almost every government is now working to. Technology and business decisions must now be considered as one entire approach to enable a green recovery and thriving net zero future, mitigate climate change, sustain reasonable returns, and ensure a fair price for the consumer.",

            "Main Point I: Grenfell lessons",
            "Part II of the Grenfell Tower fire inquiry is in recess at present, but it is three and a half years since the tragedy and the break presents an opportunity to reflect on, what is arguably, the worst construction industry related incident since World War II.",
            "I hope readers will not pass this by on the grounds that, while tragic in the extreme, it is of no direct relevance unless one is engaged in high rise residential design or construction. Nothing could be further from the truth; but this has not been given due emphasis.",
            "While the recent evidence alleging deceit – and worse – could be legitimately categorised as “not my world”,  an examination of the root causes (the essence of good risk management) shows many transferable lessons, quite separate from any fire design concerns. These are of direct application to engineers no matter what form of civil and structural engineering undertaken. In my view, it would be seen by others as negligent of us not to take note, publicise, discuss and act upon the specific issues. Not sometime in the future, but now.",
            "We need to be clear: this was not a cladding failure in the technical sense. We know, from Part I of the inquiry, that the cladding was not fit for purpose, and hence it should be of no surprise that it did not perform. The root causes go much deeper and wider than that and appear to implicate most, if not all, parties and industry procedures at a most fundamental level.",
            "The ICE acted to produce a report and a guidance note, applicable to existing structures, and is working on the recommendations of the",
            "report. However, these do not explicitly touch on the root causes and it is notable that, despite such an event, no “wake-up call” has been made directly to all members about their obligations under the ICE Code of Professional Conduct in respect of the specific underlying lessons. Such a call would not be accusatory, but instead a reminder of our key role in managing risk.",
            "Some work is ongoing in the background within ICE, with intermittent and limited announcements but is still not complete after all this time despite the hard work by some. Valuable though it may be, it is unlikely to impress Grenfell United. Nor should it.",
            "Explicit action is required: the known shortfalls in the management of critical risk in our industry require leadership and effective communication. Currently, these shortfalls have not been grasped in the necessary manner.",
            "John Carpenter (F), past secretary of the Standing Committee on Structural Safety (Scoss) jzcarpenter@aol.com",
            "It is rarely mentioned that the Grenfell tragedy is the inevitable consequence of government and local authority financial and staff cutbacks.",
            "Contractors’ designs and construction are not adequately checked and inspected by building control officers. The pre-1980s days of resident engineers and inspectors has regressed into the acceptance of dubious self-certification and local and county authorities have minimal professionally qualified staff.",

Otherwise we will continue to head into the status of a third world country.

            "I found the article about the Environment Agency’s new Flood Strategy in",
            "last month very interesting and am pleased that the Environment Agency has formally recognised the need for resilience in flood management. However, I was disappointed to note that there was no acknowledgement of the huge amount of research that has been undertaken in various UK and European universities and in research establishments such as the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado; some of this research dates back to before the last strategy was published in 2011.",
            "The lack of reference to current and recent research in the strategy may be because it is not readily accessible to non-academics; if so, this demonstrates the need for far greater collaboration across disciplines, between academia and practitioners, and between government agencies and the people affected by their decisions",
            "One of the research scientists is my daughter, Mari Tye (M), a chartered engineer and a doctor of climate science who had a paper titled",
            "Understanding the Risks from Extreme Rainfall",
            "ICE Proceedings - Forensic Engineering",
            "in 2015. In the paper she describes the need for improved resilience, using a range of flood management solutions including the traditional hard engineered flood defences and innovative solutions such as coastal realignment, rural integrated run-off management and greater use of sustainable drainage systems, among other things.",
            "In the US, the term “graceful failure” has been used to describe the design concept of flood alleviation schemes which include innovative features intended to accommodate extreme flooding without the sort of catastrophic consequences we have become used to seeing in the UK.",
            "In my view, graceful failure encompasses the Environment Agency’s “alternative pathways” and much more. The point of graceful failure is to acknowledge that designs are not totally fail-safe, and the statistics used to estimate peak water levels are not infallible. Acceptance of the fact that there will be failure – not when, but how badly – is not a popular concept with engineers or politicians; to address this issue and engender resilience requires much better collaboration and two way communication.",
            "The emphasis in the new Environment Agency strategy still remains on protection against the largest floods. Interestingly recent research shows that the cumulative financial impact of “nuisance floods” – the small ones that happen a few times a year – is greater than that of the extreme floods.",
            "Let us hope that the Environment Agency will consider the new strategy as a live document to be refined and developed in collaboration with all the potential stakeholders.",

            "Nuclear: Energy efficiency is key",
            "One wonders who is giving this government such bad advice as to push for a new nuclear power station on the Suffolk coast. The thermal efficiency of nuclear power stations is at best 40% – ie only 40% of the heat generated is converted to electrical power and over half is rejected as waste heat. Why not use this to heat people’s homes instead of the North Sea? Moreover, recent talk of degrading electricity, generated so expensively, to power heat engines for home heating when there is always plentiful waste heat available for free is further evidence of foolish advice.",
            "The most energy efficient solution in the current climate conscious world would be to invest in several power plants based on small modular reactors (SMRs) and provide district heating to distribute the waste heat from them. These would need to be constructed in or near centres of population so as to limit heat transmission losses. Resistance to modern nuclear plants near populated areas should be overcome – after all people live and work on top of SMRs on nuclear powered ships all the time.",
            "Rolls Royce is a British company struggling from the effects of Covid-19 on its aero engines business, and it also happens to be a world leader in SMR technology. Is it beyond this government to join up the dots and get Rolls Royce on the case instead of being mesmerised by EDF sales tactics?",

            "Main point II : Irish Sea crossing",
            "contained an article entitled “The Irish Sea Crossing conundrum – the technical challenge of bridging the gap between Great Britain and Northern Ireland”.",
            "The article presumed that the bridge/tunnel should land in Scotland at Portpatrick. However, the shortest distance between two points is often not the cheapest, safest, nor logical option. It is part of our job as professional engineers to point out those options our expertise allows us to see that the client may not.",
            "A logical bridge alignment, Larne to Cairnryan, where the existing ferry port is located, would not require foundations at the deepest point in Beaufort’s Dyke (300m). This would run north of Beaufort’s Dyke with its dumped munitions and require foundations in a maximum of only 140m of water. This brings the bridge supports well within the range of 1970s North Sea technology.",
            "Combining this with standard bridge deck design and using modern techniques for the wind deflectors, there would be no technical problem with the structure. The biggest problem would be the cost of the road and rail upgrades needed on the approaches to the bridge. The total cost of rail and road links from Belfast to the West Coast mainline and the A74, plus the bridge, would be close to £56bn at today’s prices. Not much for connecting Ireland by train and road to Calais and the rest of Europe, and similar to High Speed 2, between London to Birmingham.",
            "The main bridge would be slightly curved and 44km long, followed by a 7.5km road across the Stranraer peninsular and a 2.5km bridge across Loch Ryan.",
            "D Ross Carruthers (F), drc@carruthersrenewables.co.uk",
            "On previous occasions when a tunnel between Ireland and Scotland has been discussed, someone usually points out that a large quantity of explosives was deposited on",

            "This information can be quite easily found by typing “Explosives dumped in the Irish Sea in the 1940s”, or similar wording, into the internet.",
            "It does seem to me that this could be the key to whether it is practically possible or not, and any budget could be heavily influenced by having to remove or neutralise any explosives first, as doing either will be neither simple nor cheap.",

            "and that he believes that “a consideration of race” is irrelevant in design. I disagree and can think of plenty of examples where inclusion, or lack of it, has been a key factor in the success or failure of a project.",
            "In my role as a city manager it was always clear to me, and more importantly to the public, when a town centre project had been designed by a team where diversity had been fully taken into account. Moreover, access for the elderly, disabled, those with young children and more was always better when it was designed by a diverse team.",
            "For an example of race, my city centre suffered from a high-level of street violence during the evening period. It took a very determined effort by my staff, police, licensees and town centre marshals to work through our streetscape to design a setting where people of all genders, ability, age and race could safely go for an evening out.",

Expenditures on infrastructure is set to rise from the present $2.7trillion (£1.99trillion) to $6.9trillion (£5.08trillion) to achieve a disappointing 2°C increase in average temperature, when the target is 1.5°C to sustain an adequately stable climate. The numbers of engineers are far below those needed to achieve this goal.",
            "The solution proposed by the lecture is that engineers should engage in discourse with society’s leaders to emphasise the importance of engineering humanity out of the climate crisis.",

            "savings resulting from shorter vehicle journeys, and reduced congestion. Or is it?",
            "The point I make is that those calculations appear not to have been done or, worse, if they have been done, they have not been disseminated to the right people.",
            "In other words, and yet again, we in the construction industry have not communicated pertinent and relevant information to stakeholders.",

            "Speed 2 (HS2), just because it will provide a faster journey from Birmingham to London for those privileged few who commute from Britain’s second city to the metropolis.",
            "High Speed 1 (HS1) was successful because it was well marketed as being the best route to European cities for everybody. Not just the élite. And it was equally well marketed as being the fast route across the Channel with your car which, again, benefits everybody who wants to drive to Europe.",
            "So why was HS2 piggybacked onto HS1 with no thought regarding stakeholders? If HS2 had been marketed primarily as the source of significantly improved local rail services throughout the bulk of the UK it would, undoubtedly, have received more support.",
            "And we have a startlingly good example of a well marketed mega-project in the 2012 Olympics. This could also have gone horribly wrong, but it did not because it was well marketed, professionally managed and every part of it was well communicated to all stakeholders.",
            "Clear marketing strategies and concise, accurate and timely communication are as vital in construction as in all other industries. Yet there are many in our industry who pour scorn on this element, choosing instead to promote engineering prowess over population needs.",

            "In the plan, Johnson backed the development of nuclear energy, committing £525M “to help develop large and smaller-scale nuclear plants, and research and develop new advanced modular reactors”.",
            "However, according to Marshall large nuclear support is \"buried\" in the proposals and investment in small modular reactors (SMRs) is less than expected.",
            "Marshall said that “for the amount of cash” a project like the proposed Wylfa Newydd power station on Anglesey would need, “you’d imagine it would be a bit further to the front” of plans.",
            "“It’s all pretty vague about big nuclear which is interesting considering how much of a big deal it is whether or not the government go for these projects and how expensive they are,” he said.",
            "“Just to have it buried in there as ‘supporting large nuclear’, it’s not front and centre of what they’re doing.”",
            "A consortium led by Bechtel is",
            "reportedly in talks with the government about acquiring the Wylfa site",
            "funding talks between the government and developer Horzion fell through",
            "EDF's DCO application to build the Sizewell C power plant in Suffolk has also been hit by delays",

            "High Court decision to uphold planning permission for preparatory works at the site",
            "The National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) has advised the government to commit to no more than one new nuclear power station before 2025 and Marshall said he expects the Johnson to follow this guidance.",
            "“It seems they will decide on one – probably Sizewell but it could be Wylfa. I’d be surprised if it was more than one,\" he said.",
            "“The NIC advice was to commit to one at most and then see how things are – if the technology has developed, if the cost of nuclear has come down, what happens to renewables and the flexible stuff needed to balance a renewables based grid. It seems they’re sticking to that.”",
            "However, EDF UK chief executive Simone Rossi said the government announcement is a \"game changer\" and added that the energy company - which is responsible for Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C - has \"a huge contribution to make across nuclear, wind, solar, storage, hydrogen, electric heating, energy saving and electric vehicles\".",
            "Sizewell C managing director Humphrey Cadoux-Hudson added: \"Sizewell C builds on the great progress being made by UK nuclear at Hinkley Point C and, as a direct copy, it can benefit from lower construction and financing costs. We look forward to moving ahead quickly with the government on an innovative funding arrangement to achieve best value for money for consumers.”",
            "Meanwhile, Nuclear Industry Association chief executive Tom Greatrex said the commitment to nuclear as part of the future energy mix is \"an important pointer\" towards how net zero targets will be met.",
            "When it comes to smaller nuclear projects, Marshall said the announcement is disappointing for those involved in the development of small modular reactors (SMRs).",
            "Last month it was suggested that",
            "the development of mini nuclear power stations could be boosted by a £2bn government investment",
            ". The aid plan was anticipated to facilitate the design and construction of 16 sites by 2050, with work undertaken by a Rolls Royce-led consortium.",
            "Despite this expectation, the industry will only benefit from the £525M investment which covers both large and small nuclear projects.",
            "“If I was in the SMR game I’d be disappointed with this because that £2bn support for a small initial fleet of reactors has been paired back to just over £500M,” Marshall said.",
            "“It’s a lot of cash and still a lot of support – it’s more than most unproven technologies get – but it feels a bit like SMRs have been put on the backburner now. For a while it felt like the government was believing that the SMR industry could be the future.",
            "“Pairing back on what was expected to be offered might show that the government is cooling or laying down a tougher set of challenges to Rolls Royce and others in the SMR world to prove the claims are true before they get more money.”",
            "Marshall attributed this change to the increasing support for renewables.",
            "“The EU has set out huge ambitions to boost offshore wind capacity, the UK has already done that, all the rest of the world is investing in renewables whereas not many are investing in nuclear now,\" he said.",
            "cost reductions that were touted for years for nuclear industry seem to be happening",
            "whereas the evidence shows the cost of renewables is plummeting and the cost of what’s needed to balance the grid is plummeting too.”",
            "Rolls Royce UK SMR consortium interim chief executive Tom Samson has said that the proposed fleet of mini power stations will \"contribute massively to the ‘levelling up’ agenda\", creating jobs in areas in need of economic activity, while also bring \"huge value\" and \"economic activity\" to local communities.",
            "The 10 Point Plan also commits to more offshore wind projects, greater roll-out of electric vehicle infrastructure and more active travel schemes."

            "Energy infrastructure and digital innovation are two sectors the north of England needs to develop to create a “thriving economy”, a report by the Northern Powerhouse Partnership found.",
            "The North currently generates 41% of England’s electricity according to the ‘Northern Powerhouse 2050: The North’s Route map for Productivity’ report, and the region should build on this to become the “nation’s hub for low carbon and flexible energy generation”.",
            "This would requite new energy infrastructure such as off-shore wind farms in the North and Irish seas as well as repurposing existing power stations.",
            "The report, led by Mace director for the North and Scotland Steve Gillingham, suggested the north could be the centre of a Small Modular Reactor design, manufacture and maintenance programme. The SMR global market is estimated to be worth up to £250 to £400bn. Nuclear decommissioning is estimated to be worth up to £250bn globally. The development of a SMR would require £1bn investment.",
            "It also outlined a plan to “transform” the gas supply to Leeds from natural gas to low carbon hydrogen, produced in the Tees Valley, which would cost £110M to build and £29M a year to operate. The transformation would involve building a carbon capture and storage scheme (CCS) in the Tees Valley which prevents carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere during the production of fossil fuels. Overall the scheme would require £2bn worth of investment from the government and big businesses.",
            "As well as investment in energy innovation the report found that the North should commit to smart transport infrastructure. It said: “By deploying technology across its transport assets, it will be possible to optimise their potential, bring benefits to the customer and user and improve overall connectivity and journey experience across the network”.",
            "The region is the UK’s main producer of hydrogen therefore the report said the North should ask for half of the £23M Hydrogen for Transport Programme (HTP) to build refuelling stations to allow the emergence of low carbon transport technologies.",
            "These are already “areas of expertise” but are separated by “traditional geographic boundaries” which need to be overcome by investment in transport infrastructure to connect the northern cities.",
            "Chancellor Philip Hammond announced on Monday a £300M investment into northern rail links to ensure High Speed 2 can connect to future TransPennine fast trains. Northern leaders welcomed to investment but said it did not go far enough to address the region’s transport needs.",
            "Liverpool City Region metro mayor Steve Rotheram called on the government to do more to “redress the massive imbalance” between infrastructure spending in the north and south.",
            "He said: “The Government have given an unequivocal commitment to delivering Crossrail 2 for London which is likely to cost in the region of £30billion pounds – 100 times what the Chancellor has pledged for the North today.”",
            "The NPP, chaired by former chancellor George Osborne, said it is possible to create an extra 850,000 jobs and contribute an added £100bn to the UK economy.",
            "As well as energy and digital innovation the report highlighted that advanced manufacturing and health innovation were other key areas that the north should develop to strengthen the economy."

            "Laing O’Rourke has joined the Rolls-Royce led British consortium looking to win government funding to develop its",
            "small modular reactor (SMR) programme",
            "The engineering firm joins Rolls-Royce, Amec Foster Wheeler, Arup, Nuvia and the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre in the UK SMR joint venture, which is designing an innovative nuclear SMR plant.",
            "A government funding competition opened last March and was expected to close by the autumn",
            ". However, seismic political events have meant the competition deadline has been delayed.",
            "“The UK’s industrial future relies on a diversity of power sources and through this collaboration with other industry leaders, Laing O’Rourke is pleased to bring its innovation and delivery expertise to the development of small modular reactors,” said Laing O’Rourke group technical director Paul Westbury.",
            "“The innovative approach to construction and technology being applied to this project showcases modern forms of construction and is another strand to the off-site manufacturing approach that Laing O’Rourke has continued to invest in.”",
            "According to Rolls-Royce the SMR reactors would be factory manufactured, reducing risks and costs associated with nuclear projects. Reactors would reach 16m high and 4m in diameter and plants could take just five years from construction to first generating electricity.",
            "“By engaging with each other right at the design stage, we can optimise the entire plant design for modularity, for reduced risk and reduced cost as well,” said a spokesperson for the UK SMR programme.",
            "The consortium argues a UK SMR programme would create vital intellectual property rights for Britain, and could create a £400bn global export market if the UK were a leader in the field.",
            "Other SMR developers have expressed an interest in the UK’s development potential, including the China National Nuclear Corporation."

Its work on Aberdeen Harbour’s £00M expansion is a case in point. Exposed to severe waves over 8m in height, the design, construction and operation of the new harbour presents significant challenges. HR Wallingford used drones to achieve detailed survey work, and virtual reality to simulate navigation in the proposed harbour. The VR model of the new proposed harbour was set up in HR Wallingford’s navigation simulator, much like flight simulators used in the airline industry. This allowed harbour pilots to navigate different vessels into the harbour under different conditions to check and optimise the layout.",

            "Company-wide activity events define Hydrock’s corporate culture, illustrated by inviting all staff on a two-day trip to Mallorca in 2015, within the working week, to celebrate the company’s 20th anniversary. These events create opportunities for employees to share experiences together, encouraging future collaboration and promoting a sense of wellbeing. This is also epitomised by Hydrock’s annual Challenge Day. Attended by all staff and staged at the company’s headquarters near Bristol, it delivers a brief business update and connects staff from across the UK through outdoor team games, selected through personal choice, and an evening BBQ, band and bar. Employee feedback confirms that morale, teamwork and engagement all increase by enabling employees from diverse backgrounds to share these experiences together. Hydrock also offers an annual £200 healthy living bonus enabling staff to pursue activities of their choice outside of work. Emphasis on safety is brought to life through its ‘Safe People, Safe Site, Safe Home’ initiative. Everyone is properly briefed and supervised, and by summer 2016 its accident frequency rate equated to one reportable accident every 37 months as defined by RIDDOR.

Over the last 12 months feedback led it to prioritise a number of improvements to increase employee engagement, including creation of a better working environment and provided a much needed breakout room for staff to integrate and take time away from their desks. It has introduced an Employer Supported Volunteering policy allowing employees paid time off to contribute to their communities and it has established a policy giving all employees the day off on their birthday. It achieves an average of five days training per year per employee, which is now more accessible for remote sites through e-learning.

To do it a working group was formed comprising an associate director designate, graduate engineer and a technician from the app company. The project took seven months from start to completion and the app is now downloaded onto all Lithos’ engineers’ mobile phones and result is simplicity personified: the technology uses movement sensors to keep track of the lone worker and send an alert with GPS location to five designated managers back in the office should he or she stop moving and not respond to a prompt within 50 seconds. Lithos developed the app because other technologies available in the market did not use movement sensors and relied on call centres to receive and respond to emergencies. The app has strengthened health and safety procedures, provided additional reassurance to directors and, crucially, boosted the confidence of all engineers going out to site alone - especially its female engineers.",

Knowledge and experience gained from working in the UK coal fields has been extended across the world and applied to many soft ground mining applications, most significantly Potash. BHP Billiton’s Jansen Project in Saskatchewan, Canada is one such application. BHP appointed Alan Auld to deliver the design of the 1km deep access shafts for this project which are intended to be fully watertight to a depth of 800m. This required the development of shaft design techniques including detailed time dependent modelling of the geo-mechanical behaviour of artificial ground freeze and salt strata, and the development of longitudinal movement joints to prevent overstressing in the fully welded steel waterproof membrane. Advanced 3D FEM techniques were employed to minimise the use of concrete reinforcement and consider the heat transfer into the frozen ground and a potential thaw and re-freeze cycle. This project also saw the first use of a shaft boring roadheader (SBR) machine in place of traditional drill, blast and mucking methodology. This innovative project is likely to become the template for future soft ground shaft projects for BHP and the industry at large, as SBR machines provides a significantly safer method for shaft excavation.",

            "Indecision on nuclear policy, particular small modular reactors (SMRs), has seriously damaged the UK’s ability to form effective national policies, warns a new report by the House of Lords.",
            "The report called ‘Nuclear research and technology: Breaking the cycle of indecision’, said the UK had reached a critical moment and called for the government to urgently decide if the UK is to be a ‘serious player’ in developing nuclear generation technology. It called on the government to stop sitting on the fence and make a decision about the part it wants to play in nuclear policy, whether that is as a designer, operator, manufacturer, or all three. From this, other decisions would flow.",
            "Failure to make a decision on a strategy for small modular reactors (SMRs) was cited in the report as a prime example of the government’s inaction in the civil nuclear arena. If the government did not act soon, industrial interest would not be maintained, the report claimed.",
            "Committee chairman Earl of Selborne said: “The UK has long-standing and continuing commitments to civil nuclear energy and is now strategically positioned to capture opportunities, especially for small modular reactors. The incoming government must end its cycle of indecision on nuclear policy and we urge it to take a clear, firm view on SMRs and wider civil nuclear strategy.",

            "“With a potential global market for SMRs valued at £250bn to £400bn, the government must provide clarity as soon as possible after the general election if the energy, industrial and export opportunities of a UK SMR are to be realised,” said Greatrex.",

The government says the UK must improve performance standards in digital, energy, transport, water and flood defence infrastructure. It also aims to better align central government infrastructure investment with local needs. Another pillar is called ”improving procurement”. It will use the procurement process to increase innovation. “Developing skills” is another of the pillars. Its aim is to boost STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) and technical education.",

            "The smallest of small nuclear reactors, about the size of a squash court, is finding big backers and global markets.",
            "The U-battery micro-reactor is among 38 entries in the UK-government’s small modular reactor (SMR) competition, launched earlier this year. The competition is intended to begin a dialogue with this emerging industry and is attracting scores of designs from around the world.",
            "Like other designs, U-Battery’s factory-built modular design would be manufactured for assembly – being cheaper and faster to deploy than large reactors.",
            "But U-Battery’s main differentiator among SMRs is its size. At 10MW, it is 3% of the size and power of some of the largest SMR designs.",
            "Enriched uranium manufacturer Urenco has backed it. Urenco performs about a third of the world’s nuclear fuel enrichment. U-Battery’s other partners for construction and shipping expertise include consultants Amec and Atkins, contractor Laing O’Rourke and shipbuilder Cammell Laird.",
            "Not all SMRs are created equally. Light water reactors, liquid metal-cooled reactors and molten salt reactors – all are at various stages of development. The U-Battery concept has been developed a one of a group of “high temperature reactors”, which could run at about 800°C.",
            "The heat generating nuclear reaction process is relatively simple, and kept in the core. From there it is a simple process of heating helium gas, through a heat exchanger which then heats nitrogen, which then drives a generator.",
            "You’re putting all your safety in the fuel, so you don’t need any of the large complicated systems of the larger systems",
            "Steve Threllfall, U-Battery",
            "But at its heart are special tristructural-isotropic (Triso) spherical micro-fuel particles, each less than a millimetre in size. With enriched uranium at their core, they are covered in pyrolytic carbon and radiation-resistant silicon carbide. Each sphere is essentially a pressure vessel to trap the radioactive byproducts of nuclear fission. The spheres are fabricated into cylindrical “compacts”, which are housed inside layers of graphite.",
            "“This makes it all very accident tolerant – you’re putting all your safety in the fuel, so you don’t need any of the large complicated systems of the larger systems,” says U-battery general manager Steve Threlfall.",
            "The fuel and moderator are integrated into a single prismatic block. The prismatic blocks, 360mm across, 800mm high, would number 24 in the core – four high and six around. If run at higher temperatures, the outer layers of graphite expand, letting neutrons escape, shutting the process down.",
            "It has been called “meltdown-proof” but testing continues at the University of Manchester.",
            "“We haven’t been able to break it….they’ve proven it works up to 1,600°C, now they’re pushing it to 1,800°C,” says Threlfall.",
            "The downside of the advanced Triso fuel is its added manufacturing cost. U-battery will not divulge just how much more, that is a trade secret. Firstly the fuel must be 19.5% enriched, rather than the 4% to 5% required of standard European Pressurised Reactors (EPRs). But more importantly, creating the multi-layered particles is expensive. And the fuel’s complexity makes it almost impossible to reprocess, potentially influencing future economics.",
            "The first high temperature reactor, named Dragon, was built in the 1960s, so the technology has been around for a long time. But it did not get past the prototyping stage. China has taken up the baton, making small prototypes, in preparation for a large 200MW plant that is due to be commissioned next year.",
            "Threlfall says the U-battery’s  size lends itself to off-grid activities: providing heat and electricity, or just electricity, for industrial sites or remote communities.",
            "“You can also use it for desalination, hydrogen separation, and another potential – taking out and replacing the diesel backup systems for large nuclear plants.”",
            "But the markets gaining traction are Poland and Canada. Poland wants SMRs for industrial heat, replacing ageing boilers. Canada’s northern expanse hosts hundreds if not thousands of small communities with populations of up to 5,000, mostly",

            "Threlfall notes that this decentralised model – putting the power at the point of use – removes much of the cost of delivering power, whether through a grid as in the UK, or from not having to truck gallons of diesel through Canada. These delivery costs often double the price of energy for customers.",
            "The U-battery would also run for five years without needing to be refuelled, and Threlfall says it could run without on-site operators, being controlled remotely. “But a lot of this is down to discussions with regulators, what they require; a lot of countries require one person for security on site.”",
            "Threlfall says the U-battery micro-model has virtually no competition. American company Ultrasafe uses the Triso fuel, but in a different configuration, where “pebbles” move around within the reactor.",
            "“We both have a religious belief in one or the other method. Our belief is the best model is keeping everything stable, apart from the gas that flows through. [Ultrasafe] thinks it gets a better fuel burn-up with fuel that moves around. I’d say if you want to keep something in remote Canada for five years you want as few moving parts as possible.”",
            "As the UK government prepares to release a “roadmap” to guide the SMR competition entrants, U-battery is scoping how to build its design team, searching within the partner companies. It expects to go from about a dozen staff to about 50 in 2017.",
            "The first three reactors would be built on site from supplied components, buying in the reactor pressure vessel, graphite blocks and turbine – all readily available from UK suppliers.",
            "“And we want to do that [use UK suppliers], because once we move past the first three, we want to pre-assemble, probably involving five modules that each fit on the back of a truck,” says Threlfall.",
            "“All of the jobs could be in the UK, equally though, other countries have an interest. It came up in talks in Canada: if it hosts them, can they also build them?  Every country has its own industrial strategy to take care of.”",
            "While Poland and Canada are keen, international public opinion is far from overwhelmingly positive. Following 2011’s Fukushima disaster in Japan, Germany decided to close its nuclear programme. But Threlfall says nuclear will be a useful part of the international energy mix “for another couple of  hundred years”.",
            "“If you look at developing countries, and as China and India expand, they really need to do something, otherwise they end up polluting… it’s [nuclear is] the only thing that can address the challenges ahead."

            "Donald Trump’s election as US president is expected to change the game in economics and politics around the world. Take UK energy policy for instance.",
            "Trump’s decisions could make or break fledgling plans for construction of small modular reactors (SMRs) as an addition or alternative to large nuclear power plants scheduled to provide base load power from the 2030s onwards.",
            "The reason why is a combination of a few things. A successful UK SMR programme would need a whole new British industry, including trained personnel and a robust supply chain producing factory made plant –reactor, integral pipework, wiring and housing.",
            "“The idea is to make small reactors of under 300MW competitive by making them simpler and building them in modular fashion in factories where conditions and productivity are much better, to offset the apparent economies of scale of the larger gigawatt-sized plants,” says former managing director of Rolls-Royce Nuclear, Tony Roulstone who teaches on the nuclear energy masters programme at Cambridge University.",
            "“Economies of scale all lie in the vessels, equipment and systems that are factory built, but these savings are more than offset by the complexity of construction and the huge cost of 10 years or more of on-site work for the largest plants.",
            "Economies of scale all lie in the vessels, equipment and systems that are factory built, but these savings are more than offset by the complexity of construction and the huge cost of 10 years or more of on-site work for the largest plants",
            "Tony Roulstone, Cambridge University",
            "“At last, it has been realised that no private utility or reactor vendor can afford to take on the £10bn financial risk of building a single large nuclear station without government support. By reducing the size of investment and its risk, the SMR option could be made affordable and attractive for private sector investment.”",
            "These “small” plants are still pretty big. Roulstone describes them as the “parish churches rather than cathedrals of nuclear energy”. Costs of SMRs have been estimated at around £1bn per unit, compared with the £20bn price of the twin 1.65GW reactors of Hinkley Point C, with all of its complications of state-backed investments from France and China.",
            "But the UK does not require enough SMRs to make this worthwhile, so would rely on creating a new export market to make investment cost effective. And to share the development costs and beef up intellect following the decision 20 years ago to shut down the UK’s nuclear industry, the country would benefit from a partner.",
            "The vision is that multiple SMRs funded by private sector investors could be constructed on existing nuclear sites as alternatives to a single plant. SMRs would most likely be developed in partnership with another country, with the United States ahead of China and South Korea as preferred options.",
            "The US is committed to building at least one SMR, but needs its new president to continue to support the concept. It is already ahead of the UK in developing the SMR concept and two of its firms – Westinghouse and NuScale have expressed interest in the UK market.",
            "“I’d pick the US,” Roulstone says. “All nuclear reactors, including SMRs, are a complex business. American firms know the technology at a deep level. Also, there is a long term trust relationship between the US and the UK. But there is an ‘if” and it’s ‘if Trump likes it’.",
            "“The Americans are going to build at least one SMR unless Trump stops them with his new energy policies. We have a successful record of working with the US – in aerospace and the military. They are 10 years of SMR development ahead. Everything is not so completely sewn up. There are still openings for collaboration.”",
            "There is justification for the UK to push on regardless, but it will require courage and a commitment to the long term.",
            "“SMRs can also operate as combined heat and power plants providing not just electricity but also thermal energy to large scale district heat networks,” says Mott MacDonald energy economist Sam Friggens.",
            "There are a few challenges here. The amount of infrastructure investment required to make the SMRs work as combined heat and power plants would be colossal. Each city would require many kilometres of tunnels several metres in diameter to distribute hot water around city centres. There are also the issues of security, waste and public acceptability, with the latter arguably the most contentious.",
            "“SMR development needs to become part of the emerging UK industrial strategy because we think SMRs would be a good addition to the ways of addressing climate change and something we could be good at building in the UK and exporting,” says Roulstone. “But we have to make a decision to spend significant public money on development – we’d need an SMR demonstrator by 2027 in order to attract private investment for a series build by about 2030. The timescales of such a project mean that decisions are urgent.",
            "“Whether the current energy market will deliver the investment and whether we will get round to SMRs without a proper UK energy strategy are the two big questions.”",
            "The Technologies: Light water and ‘advanced’ reactors",
            "There are two groups of technologies for SMRs. Light Water Reactors (LWR) and “advanced” reactors, which group together a number of different technological approaches.",
            "Most designs coming forward are integral light water pressurised reactors, made of the same four major components that make up a standard LWR or pressurised water reactor  – the reactor, stream generators, pumps and the pressuriser.",
            "In the integral SMR, there is one vessel and all of these four components are either inside or directly part of the SMR vessel, removing all of the complicated pipe work that connects the components within a large nuclear reactor. The problem with these reactors is that they share complexity with the larger LWRs and it now appears unlikely that light water SMRs will be able to significantly reduce the cost of generation compared with larger reactors using the same technology due to no reduction in the required safety control system and site operations.",
            "The “advanced” category groups together a number of technologies including high temperature gas-cooled reactors (see feature p42), sodium-cooled reactors and molten salt reactors, among others. Some believe that this technology is too far away as there are more uncertainties in both the technical and cost aspects of advanced reactors. However, there is the possibility of a true price breakthrough because of the simplicity of design of most of these options. For example, they could have intrinsic safety which would reduce risk and control and operation requirements – but this is not yet proven."

            "On 24 June 2016, British citizens woke up to the news that – for better or worse –  they would be forging their own way in the world.",
            "Among the jubilation and the hand-wringing following the European referendum result there were more opinions than facts, and not much has changed in the months that have followed. But is it time to see the positives rather than view the inevitable challenges with doom and gloom?",
            "After all, with the upheaval comes an opportunity for reinvention. And what better role to choose than that of world leader in the rapidly emerging field of alternative energy source development?",
            "Developing nations in the lead",
            "A recent report from clean energy investment tracking body Climatescope says that developing nations are taking the lead in renewable energy production. The same study found that in areas with low access to electricity, solar technology has boomed. Self-sufficiency is on the rise.",
            "But, there are unique opportunities in Britain. Its coasts are a reliable, renewable energy source which is just beginning to be explored. Some estimate that Britain could have as much as 50% of Europe’s tidal energy resources.",
            "Although the industry is just beginning to take root, projects such as the MeyGen tidal power development in Scotland  – which has just received the go ahead for its next phase – and the Tidal Lagoon Power project in Swansea Bay show that if taken seriously enough, tidal power could provide a steady, reliable energy supply.",
            "In the past 10 years while we’ve been talking about Hinkley, nuclear has got more expensive and slower to build, and the alternatives have got cheaper",
            "What is more, our shores give us a natural stage on which to lead the way with our expertise. As Tidal Lagoon Power director of engineering and construction Mike Unsworth says: “Developing tidal lagoons which exploit our tides around our island coastline basically ensures we are generating our own, home-grown, secure and sustainable energy.”",
            "Boundaries are also being pushed with other renewables in the UK. Thames Water is building Europe’s largest solar photovoltaic farm in a London reservoir.",
            "And yet Britain is also forging ahead with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station which – while bringing 64% of the project’s £18bn value to the UK supply chain – relies on Chinese and French expertise. On top of that, a report published last autumn by University College London predicts that Hinkley Point C could be obsolete within a decade of opening in 2025.",
            "“Technically and economically, Hinkley no longer makes sense,” says Andrew Smith, principal research associate at the Bartlett School, UCL’s built environment centre . He is also deputy director of the Energy Epidemiology Research Centre.",
            "According to Smith, Hinkley appeared to be a good decision in the early noughties when it was first discussed. But a lot has happened in the fields of nuclear and alternative energy since then.",
            "“The lines have crossed in a way. We’ve gone from a position where new nuclear looked like it was going to be modular and quick to build and the supply chain would grow – and it would be affordable – and wind and [solar] photovoltaics looked like they were slow-growing and looked more expensive.",
            "We’ve got special conditions around the UK that allow us to lead in so many of these different fields, from tidal to wind and solar",
            "“And then in the past 10 years while we’ve been talking about Hinkley, nuclear has got more expensive and slower to build, and the alternatives have got cheaper, and the supply chains have grown much faster – of the order of 20% or 30% a year,” says Smith.",
            "Indeed, even small modular reactors (SMRs) seem to be facing problems. While they could meet some localised energy needs, production costs – and negative associations from the public – have slowed growth.",
            "So what is the point of pushing forward with Hinkley? Past ICE President, energy expert and Aecom energy development director Richard Coackley thinks that Hinkley is important for providing baseload capacity, and that the UK needs a diverse energy mix.",
            "“We need a selection of energy sources,” he says, stressing that diverse energy sources – including Hinkley – are crucial to the UK’s efforts to innovate.",
            "We’ve got special conditions around the UK that allow us to lead in so many of these different fields, from tidal to wind and solar",
            "“Diversity across the energy mix means that we are keeping ahead on intellectual property and so we’re leading the way across the world. We’ve got special conditions around the UK that allow us to lead in so many of these different fields, from tidal to wind and solar – all those things are just so important to increase the UK’s energy security,” says Coackley.",
            "While tidal power could provide a steady supply of energy, the technology is still in its infancy. And Hinkley will provide stability at a time when the National Grid is having to adapt to the disruptive increase in renewable technology, which – while good for meeting carbon reduction targets – brings an element of instability to electricity supplies.",
            "Traditionally, electricity generation has followed a stable path from generation to consumption. It has also been relatively steady and easy to control. But renewables are unreliable – the sun has to shine for solar panels to generate power, and the wind must blow for a wind farm to provide energy.",
            "The biggest challenge over the next few years will be in trying to counter this unreliability. Storage technology is taking centre stage, and batteries are getting special attention.",
            "“For the electricity system it’s really exciting,” says UK Power Networks low carbon technology and customer engagement manager Adriana Laguna.",
            "Battery interior (uk power networks)",
            "UK Power Networks’ Grid scale battery",
            "“I think batteries…will play a really key role in terms of the future of the smart grid.”",
            "UK Power Networks is pushing ahead on battery technology. The company has recently completed a trial involving a giant battery which can meet a whole town’s energy needs for a few hours each day (see p26).",
            "Storage has positive implications for the wider energy market too. If storage becomes widely available, the problem of renewable unreliability goes away, meaning more freedom for experimentation and innovation.",
            "“Intellectual property in all these sorts of things [renewables] will be a prime fundamental of actually leading the way as an independent UK,” says Coackley.",
            "So storage seems to be the biggest game changer – and potential disrupter – for the energy market, possibly making the argument for Hinkley obsolete.",
            "According to Tidal Lagoon Power’s Swansea Bay chair and former Atkins chief executive Keith Clarke, it is all about the price curve. “The moment you start to get energy storage that’s really cheap, either at a domestic level, or the community level, or a town level, or a regional level – and I think you’ll end up with all of those to different degrees – your argument for a baseload nuclear actually does become irrelevant,” he says.",
            "Clarke stresses that this could have a positive impact on tidal projects such as that proposed for Swansea Bay. “If we [Swansea Bay] had energy storage that was cheap, for three or four hours, we’d become baseload.”",
            "Indeed, the latest capacity market auction brought mainstream storage a step closer with several battery storage projects winning contracts. But battery storage is not the only answer – solutions such as cryogenic technology are being used to address the storage issue too.",
            "The energy market is changing so fast that it is hard to keep up. However, some feel that government subsidy cuts have had a damaging impact on the renewable sector and its growth.",
            "“The reason it’s [renewable technology] been so successful in expanding very quickly is because the policy support has been there. The policy has been completely changed in the last 18 months or so and it’s really not helpful,” says Renewable Energy Association senior policy analyst Frank Gordon.",
            "Subsidy changes have had a noticeable impact on solar power, with changes to the feed-in-tariff and renewables obligation affecting the sector’s finances the most.",
            "If Britain is to establish itself in the post-Brexit world, it must take its own efforts to innovate a little more seriously. And that means more risk-taking on tidal power projects, more innovation in storage and more support for other renewables.",
            "Failure to do so carries the risk of having to rely on others to lead the way, at a time when the British electorate has voted against just that.",
            "Capacity markets and subsidies",
            "The capacity market is the government’s main tool for making sure that energy is available during times of high demand, for example, in winter.",
            "By buying capacity in advance, the government ensures that there is enough electricity infrastructure to cope with peaks in demand. Essentially it makes sure that any gaps are filled so that the lights stay on.",
            "The capacity market has received criticism for awarding contracts to diesel generation projects, even though the market is part of the government’s decarbonisation plan.",
            "Two new gas power stations got the go-ahead after their backers won energy supply contracts after the government’s most recent capacity market auction in December.",
            "British sea turbine companies are hoping the government will continue to subsidise the technology",
            "Government subsidies for renewable technology were intended to help the markets establish themselves, and were always going to be phased out at some stage.",
            "But there has been concern that support has dropped off too quickly, meaning that industries like solar are not well enough established to thrive without subsidies.",
            "The Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) system was started in 2010, and offers subsidies for electricity generated from some renewables. The subsidies are limited to schemes up to 5MW capacity and are best suited for smaller generation projects, for example solar panels on homes or businesses. The subsidies are expected to be phased out in 2019.",
            "The Renewables Obligation (RO) was established in 2002. It obliges energy companies to buy a certain amount of their capacity from renewables sources and is designed for large-scale generation projects up to 1.5GW. The RO scheme is closing in March .",
            "The Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme replaces the RO. It involves awarding capped subsidies to renewables suppliers. The CfD is considered controversial by some, as funds are allocated by auction and different technologies compete against each other. Additionally there is a split between non-established technologies such as offshore wind and tidal energy, and established technologies such as solar and onshore wind. The latter two will not be funded for the next auction.",
            "Developing countries are taking the lead on clean energy and have 18% more renewable capacity than wealthier countries, according to a report from clean energy investment tracking body Climatescope.",
            "In the 58 emerging markets assessed, 69.8GW of new renewable generating capacity was created by developing countries in 2015 compared to 59.2GW by wealthier Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.  Four in five of the countries surveyed have now set clean energy targets.",
            "Lower solar photovoltaic equipment costs resulted in a 43% increase in utility-scale investment in 2015 to £58.1bn, meaning that solar power can now beat fossil fuel prices in some nations.",
            "Led by China and India, Asia installed far more clean energy capacity in 2015 than the other 56 countries surveyed by Climatescope combined. Asian countries secured £102.8bn in clean energy investment, or 82% of what was deployed in the 58 nations surveyed.",
            "Clean energy policies are becoming more widely adopted across sub-Saharan Africa. Fourteen of 19 Climatescope countries from the region have introduced renewable energy targets. Clean energy investment nearly doubled to £4.2bn between 2014 and 2015."

            "Small modular reactors (SMRs) could be operating in the UK by 2030 if the government can encourage early investor confidence, according to a new report by the Energy Technologies Institute (ETI).",

            "Preparing for Deployment of a UK Small Modular Reactor By 2030",
            "ETI is a private public partnership of energy and engineering companies, including EDF and",
            "preferred supplier Rolls-Royce, and the UK government.",
            "“Our analysis shows that it is possible to have a first of a kind SMR operating by 2030 if SMR developers, SMR vendors, government and regulators work together in an integrated programme,” said ETI’s nuclear strategy manager and report author Mike Middleton, who is seconded from Rolls Royce.",
            "“Creating the right environment for increasing investor confidence is critical if this schedule is to be met; there will be a key role for government in the first five years of any such programme to deliver an SMR policy framework which progressively reduces investor risk.”",
            "The study has also argued that using SMRs as combined heat and power plants, rather than just for power generation, not only has economic benefits, but it offers a low-carbon solution for many sites UK wide. In addition, because SMRs can be factory built, standardisation will reduce costs.",
            "“We have carried out further design and cost assessments which reconfirm the attractiveness of deploying SMRs as CHP plants linked to district heating systems identifying further carbon savings and cost benefits,” said Middleton.",
            "“UK regulatory assessment through generic design assessment is a big commitment. If SMR designs can combine standardised production in factories with developer options for heat take-off and cooling systems then there are two benefits. Firstly, these options can increase deployment opportunities which can further reduce unit cost; secondly it is not necessary to reassess the design or reconfigure the factory production process to deliver these options and again this reduces downstream deployment costs.”",
            "“Our work has also identified a range of sites with the right environment to facilitate early UK deployment of SMRs, with a number of them being potentially suitable for a first of a kind. But it is important to take a strategic approach to managing potential sites because of the limited number of sites suitable for large reactors in England and Wales.”",

            "The £18bn Somerset power station, which gained government go-ahead last week, has received criticism for been",
            "and of having an uproved design.",
            "But on 16 September de Rivaz defended the power station. “Hinkley Point C will generate low-carbon, reliable, baseload generation around the clock – there when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine,” he said.",
            "EDF is developing small modular nuclear reactors, one of the",
            "proposed alternatives to Hinkley",
            ", and de Rivaz said the French energy company believes they have “great potential” in the UK, complementing larger nuclear power stations and renewables. But he said: “Today no one can know how long it will take for policymakers, regulators and planners to approve these designs and what they will cost.”",
            "Defending Hinkley against renewables, he said that although wind has a “critical role”, its intermittency meant it could not be relied upon to meet demand. In addition, he claimed Hinkley was cheaper than offshore wind. “As for offshore, recent auctions for UK offshore wind projects averaged £137 per megawatt hour (MWh) compared with £92.50 for Hinkley Point C. That excludes system integration costs at around £10 per MWh,” he said.",
            "Hinkley has also come under criticism for the design – similar to that being used at the beleaguered Flamanville site in France. However, de Rivaz claimed",
            "is now on track and the team had learnt lessons. “The testing programme for the [EDF developed] Taishan EPR (in China) is running smoothly. Cold testing is complete and preparations for hot testing are underway. These are some of the final steps before commissioning,” he added."

            "Throw in the fact that the French trade unions don’t like it, that EdF’s finances are not the healthiest, and that the French nuclear regulator is examining flaws in steel used at Flammanville and it’s all a bit murky.",
            "But no matter, a green light is a green light and it is very good news for Bouygues, Laing O’Rourke, Costain, Bam Nuttall and others who have been itching to get cracking. The industry did need something to get excited about and maybe this is it.",
            "Because turning to HS2, things really do look to be in a bit of a pickle there. This week began with news that chief executive Simon Kirby is off to Rolls Royce. Losing one top executive would usually be considered unfortunate, but to lose several would surely be considered careless – and that is where HS2 now is.",
            "Kirby’s exit comes hot on the heels of the departure of the project’s spin doctor Ben Ruse and not months after chief engineer Chris Dulake also called it a day.",
            "The obvious conclusion is that they know something we don’t and it may well be that is the case. It’s clear that there are huge issues being dealt with internally: Euston remains a major headache at the southern end; the business case at the northern end has shifted totally to east-west connectivity (which is tricky for a north-south line); and in the middle there is still an odd desire to accelerate the route to Crewe and fudge its route around Sheffield. It all leaves the outsider more and more in the dark about what the project is about.",
            "The Public Accounts Committee certainly counts as one such outsider: its report this week highlighted cost estimates that remain “volatile” and “uncertainty” over how HS2 will work with the rest of the transport system, particularly in the north.",
            "Cutting directly to the chase, it said Parliament and the public are still in the dark about crucial details – not least when the railway will open, how much it is expected to cost and precisely where it will go. Hmm.",
            "Finally, to Heathrow where desperation seems to have taken hold. Cost cutting is the order of the day now, with the airport realising a little late that it’s hugely expensive proposals are totally unpalatable to the airlines who must pay for them. So this week we heard from its new chairman a bizarre idea to deal with the small matter of the 14-lane M25. The new plan seems to be to scrap plans route it under the new runway via a 600m tunnel and re-route it instead around the airport – “or there may even be some form of bridge”. Well thought out then.",
            "We’ll hear more about the government’s views on HS2 and Heathrow in the weeks to come. Right now they look like projects badly in need of some clear thinking. But then, hey, so does Hinkley – and that’s got the nod. So good week or bad week? You decide."

            "“Despite this being called a ‘final decision’ to build Hinkley C, other hurdles, including technical and legal challenges, may well lie ahead for the project,” he said.",
            "“French trade unions don’t like it, nor do some of the likely candidates for the French Presidential Election next year, EDF’s finances are not the healthiest, and the French nuclear regulator is examining flaws in steel used for a similar reactor being built in France. So it may turn out not to be quite as ‘final’ as it looks now.",
            "“Although China is reportedly happy with the new position, questions also remain over its main ambition – building its own nuclear reactors at Bradwell in Essex as a route into the Western market. The Chinese reactor hasn’t even begun the process of gaining UK safety approval, which usually takes four years, so negotiating a contract for Bradwell would fall to the next UK Government, not this one. By then, electricity from other sources might look a whole lot cheaper than it does now.”",
            "It may turn out not to be quite as ‘final’ as it looks now.",
            "ECIU energy analyst Dr Jonathan Marshall added that other parts of the UK’s energy mix needed similar certainty from the Government. He said: “If Hinkley does get built it will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to delivering the UK’s low-carbon power, but at a hefty premium to bill-payers in this generation and the next,” he said.",
            "“Now the decision is done, one assumes that the Government will turn its attention to delivering similar certainty to other parts of the low-carbon energy system, notably offshore wind, tidal power, energy efficiency and demand-side response.",
            "“Another thing for it to consider is whether the Hinkley model of bespoke, one-off deals with preferred bidders is really the way it wishes to do business; a more free-market approach, with genuine competition between low-carbon providers which also rewards innovation rather than incumbency, is surely the way to go.”",
            "Although Dame Sue Ion, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, pointed out that the decision could pave the way for more energy investments. She said: “It’s very good news that after further reflection the Government has given the go ahead for Hinkley Point. Despite all the negative comments this is a good deal for the UK. Hinkley Point, we mustn’t forget, is the first of the new fleet of reactors to be built to secure our low carbon electricity supplies for the future. The news sends a tremendous boost of confidence to the sector generally and I hope it will pave the way for positive investment decisions for the Hitachi reactors at Wylfa on Anglesey and the Westinghouse reactors at Moorside in Cumbria, which are expected to achieve licensed status very shortly.",
            "“This diversity in systems approved for deployment in the UK offers tremendous opportunities for UK companies to benefit as part of the global supply chain. The positive decision on Hinkley Point will bring immediate benefit to a number of our biggest engineering and construction companies.”",
            "Start of a positive future",
            "For the infrastructure companies themselves, who have hundreds of millions of pounds of work riding on this decision, the news was naturally met with open arms.",
            "Civils firms in Somerset have already heavily invested on the back on an anticipated go-ahead. RK Bell group is part of Somerset Infrastructure Alliance and one of Hinkley’s preferred bidders. Managing director Nick Bell said: “We are delighted at today’s announcement. We have been working diligently on putting together an Alliance of like-minded local businesses to bid for and undertake these works for EDF. We are very much looking forward to putting our upskilled business and equipment to work very soon.",
            "“We have invested in up-skilling the business to enable us to deliver in the new nuclear environment including the latest construction equipment, adding staff and adopting apprenticeship schemes. R K Bell group formed an alliance branded as the Somerset Infrastructure Alliance. EDF strategy and vision has enabled us as a local business to bid for and win the contract on a new nuclear build whilst leaving a positive lasting legacy for the Somerset community.”",
            "We have invested in up-skilling the business to enable us to deliver in the new nuclear environment.",
            "Kier, in joint venture with BAM Nuttall, has been undertaking site preparation works at Hinkley Point since 2012 and currently has approximately 350 employees working on the project at the moment. It has a £203M contract for the enabling works.",
            "Kier Group chief executive Haydn Mursell said: “Today’s decision marks a major step in the UK’s nuclear renaissance and reflects the country’s commitment to a balanced energy strategy including low carbon energy sources.”",
            "Atkins is part of EDF Energy’s Strategic Supply Chain Partnership. Its chief executive officer Uwe Krueger said: “Today’s green light is a very positive step for the nuclear industry in the UK as a whole and an encouraging signal of commitment from the government to building crucial energy infrastructure in this country. Nuclear power is an important part of our energy mix and has a major role to play in the transition to a low-carbon future. We are looking forward to continuing our 30 year-long relationship with EDF Energy during the construction and operational life of Hinkley Point C.”",
            "WSP Parsons Brinckerhoff UK managing director for energy and industry Ian Maclean said: “This is the good news we’ve all been waiting for. After years of delays we can now look positively to the future, prepare our business and recruitment plans accordingly, and start filling the growing gap in our energy mix. However, this is just the beginning. We now need to start delivering not just on this one project but also other major nuclear projects – both big and small modular reactors – that are yet to get off the ground.”",
            "This is the good news we’ve all been waiting for.",
            "But he added: “Whilst this is a huge step forward in decarbonising our energy supply, we shouldn’t ignore the widespread public demand for renewables, as recent polls have suggested. Hopefully this is a sign that the Government intends to create a business climate that will encourage investors and developers alike to forge ahead with a new fleet of power plant that includes a mix of both renewable energy and nuclear power, as well as gas-fired power plants to provide cleaner and safer energy to UK plc.”",
            "Other options ’cheaper and quicker’",
            "Maclean’s point about renewable energy  was shared by the renewables sector which pointed out that other energy sources, such as solar, cost less and were faster to get into action. The",
            "Renewable Energy Association",
            "chief executive Nina Skorupska said: “Renewables such as solar, onshore wind and biomass are already cheaper than nuclear, are quicker to deploy, and have none of the construction or economic risk. From the time Hinkley Point C was proposed to now we’ve seen extraordinary advancements in technology, falling costs, and high deployment rates. Since the project’s initial consultation in 2008 the UK has gone from producing less than 6 percent of its electricity from renewables to over 25 percent in the first quarter of 2016. Our analysis shows that for nearly every renewable technology the equivalent amount of capacity could be procured at much lower cost using renewables.",
            "“While we welcome a diverse low-carbon energy mix, we urge the government to consider the costs and support other industries in which the UK could be a global leader, such as energy storage.”",
            "Civil Engineering Contractors Association",
            "(CECA) chief executive Alasdair Reisner added: “Hinkley Point presents a tremendous opportunity for the UK’s civils contractors to show they are among the best in the business. Four years ago, the London Olympics demonstrated the capacity of CECA members to deliver world-class mega-projects on time and on budget. Hinkley Point will showcase our industry, support long-term jobs for thousands of workers, and make a vital contribution to the mixed portfolio of energy generation we will rely upon in the future.”"

            "The government’s surprise announcement to delay its final decision about Hinkley Point nuclear power station has been described as “bonkers” by the GMB union and “chaos” by Labour. But is it?",
            "Engineering organisations were – on face value – more circumspect, with ICE director general Nick Baveystock describing the move as “disappointing” and the Civil Engineering Contractors Association concerned that it would cause “uncertainty”. The underlying message is that such a move does little post-Brexit to prove that Britain is open for business.",
            "That’s true. But, in the big scheme of things, is the government’s decision to delay such a bad move?",
            "It was certainly a surprise. The industry had barely begun rejoicing after French giant EDF announced it had approved the funding at its board meeting on Thursday before the government came out and said it was “only right” to review the project and would make a decision by the autumn.",
            "So what’s driven this? Well, the reasons are unclear but in reality there are any number to choose from. Geo-politically, while EDF is responsible for sourcing the funding for most of the £18-25bn scheme, a great deal of the cash is coming from China. There is a great irony in Britain voting for independence and then handing control of its energy future to France and China. That cannot have been lost on politicians.",
            "That wouldn’t perhaps be such an issue if it wasn’t for the extraordinary price – EDF is guaranteed to be paid £92.50 per megawatt-hour (MWh) generated – that’s in 2012 money, and is index-linked. In 2016, that’s just under £102 – about double the current wholesale electricity price. That deal was struck under the Coalition government and an awful lot has changed since then.",
            "Then there are the obvious problems EDF is having making its technology work. Its first EPR under construction, at",
            "in Finland, was supposed to open in 2010; the second, at",
            "in France, was due to start firing in 2012. Neither is anything like operational yet. Olkiluoto will cost more than twice as much as forecast, Flamanville nearly three times as much. And its not even as if the problems have been the same on both – they haven’t. Each plant has hit its own obstacles, offering minimal confidence that different problems won’t emerge at Hinkley – and leave the UK taxpayer footing the bill to fix them.",
            "It’s for this reason that two EDF directors have quit over its decision to approve the funding, and they were not lone wolves in this: ratings agencies are warning of a downgrade and the French unions are not on board either.",
            "So this does seem like a great moment to take stock and reflect on what we are really trying to achieve here. Is it a cheap, reliable source of energy? Well, gas plants or biomass do that – and very quickly. Or is it a green, renewable source of energy? Well, tidal lagoons would do that – and in a not dissimilar timescale. Or is it to develop an industry and a technology that the UK can export around the world, using all these new (yet to materialise) trade agreements that Brexit brings?",
            "Because if it is that, and there needs to be some consideration of this, then Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) have to be looked at very seriously.",
            "Last month we carried letters from proponents of SMRs – nuclear technology on a smaller scale that could be developed as fabulous UK export story. These reactors harness UK nuclear expertise borne out of submarine propulsion and would be built in factory environments that are fully in line with the UK construction industry’s desire to deliver differently.",
            "One thing that Britain did pretty well in previous decades was to build an industrial strategy around its nuclear prowess. British scientists designed reactors, British companies built them, British engineers installed them. Repeated use of the same designs increased expertise and kept costs down. In short, a supply chain was developed, and it could be developed again.",
            "So herein lies the big question: How many SMRs does it take to build a Hinkley?"

            "Defence contractor Babcock Rosyth Defence has come up with innovative civil engineering solutions for a submarine support cradle at Rosyth dockyard.",
            "The seaweed-encrusted submarine on the raised concrete slab looks tiny inside Rosyth's cavernous 80 year old Number 3 Dock, originally built for Britain's massive First World War battleships.",
            "Close up, however, the vessel towers above the dock floor. It is enormous. Equally surprising is the concrete slab underneath. What seemed unspectacular from a distance turns out to be a highly sophisticated £2.5M 'floating' cradle.",
            "The submarine is sitting on a matrix of huge steel blocks fixed to four massive concrete planks supported in turn by hundreds of rubber pads. It is the world's first earthquake-proof submarine docking cradle and engineers are testing its structural integrity using the 4,600t retired hunter/killer submarine HMS Swiftsure.",
            "Full scale earthquake simulations for the structure are impossible, so dockyard owner Babcock Rosyth's consultant Babtie has carried out extensive calculations which prove that the structure could withstand an earthquake measuring five on the Richter scale.",
            "The cradle is part of a £40M seismic upgrade of Rosyth Royal Dockyard's nuclear submarine refitting facilities and has been designed by Babtie using state of the art earthquake technology developed in the US and Japan.",
            "Rosyth's naval dockyard was established in 1912 to build battleships during Britain's First World War militarisation. Though its massive docks are hugely robust - they are founded directly on sound sandstone bedrock and have 7m thick concrete floors - no thought was given to earthquakes in their original design.",
            "In 1994, when Babcock Rosyth Defence's nuclear licence for the dockyard came up for review, the nuclear safety authorities - the Ministry of Defence Central Plant Control Authority and the Nuclear Industry Inspectorate - started probing the dock's seismic safety case.",
            "That led to the progressive upgrade of the Number 2 and Number 3 drydocks starting in 1995.",
            "'The brief was to provide enhanced facilities that would make the risk of a nuclear incident as low as reasonably practicable,' says Babcock Rosyth Defence chief civil engineer Mike Murray. Built by contractor Nuttall, the new submarine docking cradle formed part of this programme.",
            "Its main requirement is to support submarines ranging from 4,600t hunter/killers to 7,800t Polarises while they are refitted and refuelled. Submarines must be kept vertical when fuel rods are removed from reactor cores. Any movement of a submarine during this work could make the reactor unstable, and in the worst case, could result in a reactor core melt down.",
            "Submarines are traditionally supported in the dock on a system of blocks fixed to the dock floor. This system resists the vertical loads imposed by the weight of the vessel but only gives nominal horizontal resistance.",
            "As a result a conventional cradle would be unable to resist horizontal loads imposed by a powerful earthquake and there is a risk that a submarine could be overturned by the massive lateral forces. Horizontal loading induced by a Richter scale five earthquake would be more than 40,000kN.",
            "Seismic forces are among the extreme loads considered as part of the safety case for Britain's nuclear industry, which designs on the basis that an earthquake measuring five on the Richter scale will take place once in 10,000 years.",
            "The quake is considered as a series of accelerations and frequencies with the peak horizontal acceleration taken as 1g. Adjusted for extremely good site conditions - Rosyth is built directly on to the sandstone bedrock - this has been reduced to 0.25g and modified for the traditional docking cradle's natural frequency of around 8Hz.",
            "Two other cradle designs were considered. One was an extremely robust structure that could resist the very high loads. The other idea was to reduce the loads on the cradle and vessel by isolating the cradle from the dock with rubber bearings. Both systems were costed at similar amounts but the base isolation cradle was chosen.",
            "Crucially, the 'floating' cradle system removes the risk that a submarine will move in the cradle during an earthquake. This would still have been an issue with a more robust cradle with side walls to support the submarine.",
            "By resting the cradle on rubber bearings that dampen the horizontal forces the submarine/cradle system is isolated from the effect of an earthquake on the dock. Reducing the loads also made it possible to design a less bulky structure that will allow work to be carried out underneath the boat.",
            "'Though it retains the original block and capper arrangement, a feature of the new cradle is that blocks can be removed from any position to allow work to be carried out,' says Baird.",
            "The cradle will support submarines on the steel blocks fitted with Douglas Fir softwood cappers profiled to the shape of the vessel hull. These are secured to four 29m high, 9m long and 500mm deep modular concrete rafts each sitting on 120 rubber bearings costing a total of £500,000. These are bolted to concrete plinths cast on to the dock floor (see box).",
            "Supplied by Andre Rubber of Burton on Trent, the 400mm square bearings are made from a special rubber compound designed for stiffness and damping. The bearings contain 12 layers of rubber reinforced with 3mm thick steel shims. The Malaysian Rubber Producers Association helped in the design of the bearings. A typical load on each plinth is about 250t.",
            "Although base isolation is becoming commonplace in buildings in the US and Japan, where there is a lot of seismic activity, it is a completely new system for supporting nuclear submarines.",
            "'Number 3 dock at Rosyth is now the safest nuclear submarine refuelling and refitting dock available in the UK,' Murray claims proudly.",
            "HEAVYWEIGHT GATE: Babcock's earthquake proof submarine cradle is part of a four year seismic upgrade in which the most noticeable project has been a giant new concrete dock gate to replace the old steel entrance.",
            "This involved constructing a huge inverted door frame inside Number 3 Dock, comprising two massive jambs on either dock wall and a giant sill across the dock floor connecting the two sides.",
            "The dock gate is an enormous 6,000t floating concrete caisson which won the small project category of the 1996 British Construction Industry Awards. The caisson butts up to the new concrete frame to create an earthquake resistant dock gate. A rubber lip seal on the leading edge of the caisson is forced against the jambs by the hydrostatic pressure of the sea.",
            "When in the closed position the caisson sits on a gravel bed which provides the base seal. It is floated out to a temporary berth when the dock is open.",
            "Because construction of the sill and jambs required partial demolition of the dock structure while the dock was in use, planning of the 300m3 pours was complex.",
            "The pours also presented a challenge for the contractor. 'Because of the massive volumes we had to develop a system for minimising the temperature difference between the centre and the surface of the concrete,' says James Scobie, area manager for main contractor Nuttall. 'This was achieved by delivering cooling water to the core through a network of steel pipes. Thermocouples monitored the temperature.'",
            "The concrete caisson gate replaces the original 15m high sliding steel gate which did not provide adequate seismic resistance. The steel gate opened by sliding sideways into a narrow chamber in the dock wall. The chambers have also been strengthened with steel props as part of the upgrade.",
            "'About 70 steel props each weighing about 12t were required,' explains Babcock Rosyth deputy project manager McBride. 'That totals 800t of steel.'"
