The North Carolina, USA-headquartered company said yesterday it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Synthos SA, a Polish manufacturer of synthetic rubber and one of the country's biggest producers of chemical raw materials.",
            "The BWRX-300 design (Image: GEH)",
            "Jon Ball, executive vice president of nuclear plant projects for GEH, said: \"Through our design-to-cost approach, we are designing the BWRX-300 to be cost-competitive with gas, renewables and other forms of power generation. We applaud Synthos for its interest in small modular reactor technology and advocacy of clean-energy options for Poland.”",
            "Michal Solowow, owner of Synthos, said: \"Utilising small modular reactors to generate clean energy will improve our chances to move away from coal and have a positive impact on our industry and nation.\"",
            "The BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe SMR derived from GEH's 1520 MWe Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) design. According to GEH, the BWRX-300 leverages the design and licensing basis of the ESBWR, which received design certification from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 2014. In May this year, GEH has initiated a vendor design review by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission for its BWRX-300 design.",
            "GEH expects that the BWRX-300 will require up to 60% less capital cost per megawatt when compared to other water-cooled SMR designs or existing large nuclear reactor designs. It is the tenth evolution of GE's first boiling water reactor design, since it began commercialising nuclear reactors in 1955.",
            "Poland has plans to build its first large-scale nuclear power plant. According to a draft energy policy document released for public consultation last November by Poland’s Ministry of Energy, this will be in operation by 2033. The document envisages 6-9 GWe of nuclear capacity in operation by 2043, accounting for about 10% of Poland's electricity generation. The selection of location for the first plant would be made in 2020, while the selection of the technology and general contractor would take place the following year. The first plant - with a capacity of 1.0 to 1.5 GWe - would be completed by 2033. Up to six reactors, with a combined capacity of 6-9 GWe, would be put into operation by 2043.",

            "core internals, reactor core",
            "The 200 MWe design is an integrated pressurized water reactor (PWR) in which all primary components are located inside the reactor pressure vessel. It is designed to be completely fabricated in the factory and is scaled to be shippable by rail. The Westinghouse SMR's passive safety systems and components draw on those developed in the design of the AP1000, the company's full-scale PWR currently under construction at Haiyang and Sanmen in China and earmarked for new build projects at Vogtle and VC Summer in the USA.",
            "Both the core and reactor vessel internals of the SMR are derived from the AP1000. The core, at the foot of the module, is composed of partial-height derivatives of the 17x17 fuel assembly used in the AP1000. The reactor vessel internals are modified for the smaller core and to provide support for the internal control drive rod mechanisms. Horizontally-mounted axial-flow canned motor pumps provide the driving head for the reactor coolant system, and a compact steam generator and pressurizer integrated into the reactor vessel head completes the design.",
            "Westinghouse chief technology officer Kate Jackson said the unit would be another option for providing a safe, affordable and secure source of clean-air energy to the world's rapidly changing and diverse markets: \"The Westinghouse SMR enables us to bring together all that we know about operating nuclear plants, designing and licensing plants, and passive safety into a small design that will provide additional power options for our customers.\"",
            "Generically, small modular reactors are seen as offering a number of advantages over typical nuclear plants in various circumstances, such as where grid systems cannot cope with the load from a 1000+ MWe nuclear power plant, or in remote locations. Small reactors are expected to offer greater simplicity of design, economy of mass production, and reduced siting costs as well as incorporating a high level of passive or inherent safety in the event of malfunction. A number of small reactor designs from 25 MWe up to around 300 MWe are in various stages of development around the world.",
            "In a press release which described the Westinghouse SMR as \"another milestone in energy history\", Westinghouse also said it was actively working to prepare for the upcoming US Department of Energy small reactors program, and intended to be the \"leading industry collaborator\" in the initiative. In May 2010, US energy secretary Steven Chu announced $20 million of funding for research and development in Generation IV reactors including small reactors, and the US budget request submitted earlier this week by President Barack Obama included a $97 million request to support research into small modular reactors."

Shaw noted its module-assembly experience and capability could come in useful for future small reactor projects and that it already worked with Holtec on casks for storage of used nuclear fuel. Holtec said that HI-SMUR would be \"passive in every aspect of its operation,\" using gravity-induced coolant flow while producing 140 MWe."

            "Westinghouse wants to work with the UK on the deployment of small modular reactor (SMR) technology. Westinghouse, part of the Toshiba group, said yesterday it had presented a \"proposal to partner\" in phase two of a study being carried out by the UK government into the nation's potential use of SMRs.",
            "Phase one - an SMR feasibility study commissioned by the government and carried out by the UK's National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) - was published in December last year. There are SMR concepts for a range of applications including electricity production, district heating, desalination and plutonium management.",
            "A cut-away of Westinghouse's SMR",
            "Westinghouse said that its unsolicited proposal outlines a \"shared design and development model\" under which the company would contribute its SMR conceptual design and then partner with UK government and industry to complete, license and deploy it. It added that the collaboration would create \"a new option for safe, clean-air energy that leverages the innovative technology\" of Westinghouse's AP1000 nuclear power plant.",
            "\"We are proposing a strategy that would put the UK at the forefront of SMR development, advancing its standing in nuclear energy innovation and creating significant economic opportunities through leadership in the global market,\" said Jeff Benjamin, senior vice president, Westinghouse New Plants and Major Projects. \"Our proposal is designed to fully engage UK industry and spur new manufacturing activity that would create numerous good jobs in the UK.\"",
            "Westinghouse's SMR design is a 225 MWe integral pressurized water reactor with all primary components located inside the reactor vessel.",
            "The partnership would be structured as a UK-based enterprise jointly owned by Westinghouse, the UK government and UK industry, Westinghouse said, adding that it is in talks with \"a number of UK flagship companies\" that support for the concept.",
            "Westinghouse announced on 17 March that the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) it had approved Westinghouse's testing approach for its SMR design. The company said that the approval is a significant step toward design certification and will reduce the time ultimately needed to license its SMR.",
            "The Westinghouse-designed Sizewell B plant, in Suffolk, England was built in 1988 and is currently the only pressurized water reactor and last nuclear reactor built to date in the UK. In addition, three Westinghouse AP1000 units are planned for the Moorside site in West Cumbria. When fully operational, the units will deliver about seven percent of the UK's future electricity needs.",
            "The AP1000 plant design received a design certification amendment from the NRC in 2011. Eight AP1000 units are currently under construction at four sites in the USA and China.",
            "A UK parliamentary committee said after publication of the SMR feasibility study in December, that the technology could potentially have a key role to play in delivering low carbon energy at a lower upfront capital cost than large conventional nuclear reactors. The commercial viability of SMRs however remains unclear, it added. The study suggested that, in the short-term, deployment of SMRs is likely to be achieved through sharing the costs between the public and private sector. However, it says the government should help establish the right conditions for investment in SMRs, such as \"through supporting the regulator to bring forward approvals in the UK, and by setting out a clear view on siting options\".",
            "The government later said that the second phase of work is intended to provide the technical, financial and economic evidence base required to support a policy decision on SMRs. If a future decision was to proceed with UK development and deployment of SMRs, then further work on the policy and commercial approach to delivering SMRs will need to be undertaken, which could lead to a technology selection process for Generic Design Assessment (GDA), the government said.",
            "On 5 October NuScale said it aims to deploy its SMR technology in the UK with the first of its 50 MWe units in operation by the mid-2020s. The company is looking for partners to make this happen. US-based NuScale is developing its technology with a cost-sharing award from the US Department of Energy (DOE) worth $217 million over five years. Next year the company wants to apply for design certification and it hopes to have its first unit in operation in late 2023, generating power in Idaho for prospective customer the Utah Association of Municipal Power Systems. NuScale plans a construction and operating licence (COL) application late in 2017 or early 2018. The company also expects to apply for a GDA in the UK in a similar timeframe.",
            "The NUScale Power Module is a 160 MWt, 50 MWe integral PWR with natural circulation.",
            "The Prism and Enhanced Candu 6 (EC6) reactors are seen as \"credible options\" for managing the UK's plutonium stockpile, according to the UK's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, but the government's preferred option for this remains reuse as mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel. In early 2012, the NDA invited expressions of interest on potential alternative credible full lifecycle management options for managing the UK's plutonium stockpiles. The use of plutonium in MOX fuel had earlier been selected as the preferred route by the government. Four responses were received and the NDA shortlisted two of them - GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy's Prism reactor and Candu Energy's EC6 reactor - for further consideration.",
            "NNL has said that SMRs are proposed to have more flexible fuel cycle options, whether that is an \"open\" fuel cycle (direct disposal) or a \"closed\" fuel cycle (reprocessing and recycling). For example, a fast reactor SMR fleet could be envisaged as a dedicated reactor concept to manage plutonium stocks and minor actinide incineration. Light water reactor SMRs could equally be used for plutonium management, as proposed for the IRIS (International Reactor Innovative and Secure) design and with the potential of these designs to have a reduced or even avoid the need for an Emergency Planning Zone.",
            "SMRs are defined as nuclear reactors generally 300 MWe equivalent or less, designed with modular technology using module factory fabrication, pursuing economies of series production and short construction times. This definition, from the World Nuclear Association, is closely based on those from the IAEA and the US Nuclear Energy Institute."

            "The DoE said that it had signed three separate memorandums of agreement (MoA) with Hyperion Power Generation, NuScale Power and Holtec International's SMR LLC subsidiary. Hyperion has designed a 25 MWe fast reactor, while Holtec and NuScale have designed small pressurized water reactors with capacities of 140 MWe and 45 MWe, respectively.",
            "According to the DoE, the agreements will \"help leverage Savannah River's land assets, energy facilities and nuclear expertise to support potential private sector development, testing and licensing of prototype SMR technologies.\" In addition, they would help private companies to \"obtain information on potential SMR reactor siting at Savannah River and provide a framework for developing land use and site services agreements to further these efforts.\"",
            "The DoE said, \"By strengthening information sharing and access to site facilities and technical expertise, these MoAs will help break down engineering and testing barriers to advanced nuclear reactor research and development while providing these nuclear companies with the resources to support effective deployment plans.\"",
            "Savannah River manager Dave Moody said, \"We have a unique combination of nuclear knowledge and laboratory expertise, infrastructure, location and much more to make the site a natural fit for advancing the small modular reactor technology.\"",
            "However, the DoE stressed that the new agreements \"do not constitute a federal funding commitment.\" It said that it envisages private sector funding to be used to develop these technologies and support deployment plans. The DoE added that the agreements are unrelated to its funding opportunity announcement for SMR cost-share projects announced in January.",
            "Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, which manages SRS on behalf of the DoE, has proposed a demonstration complex with prototype or demonstration models. Hyperion has signed an agreement to build the first and SRNS has approached several other small-reactor developers. The DoE has the authority to build and operate such small reactors if they are not supplying electricity to the grid.",
            "Generically, small modular reactors are seen as offering a number of advantages over typical nuclear plants in various circumstances, such as where grid systems cannot cope with the load from a 1000+ MWe nuclear power plant, or in remote locations. Small reactors are expected to offer greater simplicity of design, economy of mass production, and reduced siting costs. A number of small reactor designs from 25 MWe up to around 300 MWe are in various stages of development around the world."

            "The two organisations will now work together to define the technical, safety, economic and financial requirements for constructing a Rolls-Royce SMR power station in Jordan for electricity generation and water desalination. The outcome of the feasibility study will be used to inform an investment decision by JAEC to move forward to project delivery phase, according to the company statement.",
            "Harry Holt, president for nuclear at Rolls-Royce, said: \"With demand for global energy set to rise due to new technologies such as electric cars and increasing requirements for water desalination and district cooling, international interest in Rolls-Royce small modular reactor technology is growing. It represents an important British export opportunity.\"",
            "Khaled Toukan, JAEC chairman JAEC, said in the Rolls-Royce statement: \"SMRs offer unique opportunities to address many of the challenges confronting Jordan, in particular water scarcity and small grid size, through the introduction of nuclear in the country as part of the energy mix.\"",

The company projects the BWRX-300 will require up to 60% less capital cost per MW when compared to other water-cooled SMRs or existing large nuclear designs, which would make it cost-competitive with combined cycle gas and renewables.",
            "\"We believe that nuclear power has a vital role in ensuring a clean, reliable, and cost-effective supply of electricity to meet the needs of a growing economy,\" Dan Stoddard, Dominion Energy's , Chief Nuclear Officer, said. \"We also believe the innovations GE Hitachi is pursuing with the BWRX-300 Small Modular Reactor have the potential to make it a strong competitor in the marketplace. Our view is that a modest investment now to support further development of this technology is in the interest of both companies.\"",
            "GEH said Dominion Energy's funding of the BWRX-300 provides \"seed money\" to further work that could lead to commercialisation of the technology, but noted that Dominion \"has no plan at this time\" to build the reactor at any of its commercial nuclear plants.",
            "The NRC in 2015 approved a combined construction and operating licence (COL) for an ESBWR, Fermi 3, to be built by DTE Energy in Michigan. The ESBWR was also selected by Dominion Virginia Power as the technology of choice for a potential third reactor at North Anna in Virginia; for which a COL was issued in 2017. DTE has not to date taken a decision to proceed with Fermi 3, while Dominion placed the North Anna project on hold in September 2017."

            "The GNPPO was formed to oversee the implementation and coordination of the nuclear power programme following a 2008 cabinet decision to include nuclear in the energy mix of the African country. Ghana subsequently declared its intention to pursue a nuclear power programme for peaceful purposes in August 2013, through a letter submitted to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),",
            "the Presidential statement",
            "said. An independent nuclear regulatory authority and a project company - Nuclear Power Ghana (NPG) - were also established.",
            "The Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC), through its technical institute (NPI-GAEC) with support from other national bodies, has met all the Phase 1 nuclear infrastructure requirements recommended by the IAEA's Milestones approach, the statement added. IAEA Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review missions in 2017 and 2019 \"concluded that Ghana has satisfied all the prescribed studies for government to make a knowledgeable commitment to a Nuclear Power Programme,\" it said. The studies and activities undertaken in Phase 1 of the nuclear power programme have been consolidated into a Programme Comprehensive Report (PCR).",
            "\"I, hereby, announce and instruct the Minister for Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI) and the Minister for Energy (MoE), in collaboration with the Chief of Staff at the Office of the President, to take all the necessary steps to move the Ghana Nuclear Power Programme Organisation (GNPPO) from the Ministry of Energy to the Office of the President, to enhance proper coordination among the key institutions already established,\" the President said. GAEC and NPI-GAEC will continue to support the GNPPO at the Office of the President following the realignment.",
            "The declaration also said that the government has adopted the content of the PCR \"as a reflection of nuclear power infrastructure issues in the country\",  and committed to \"continue their transparency, adherence to the strict standards of safety, security, and accountability in the peaceful uses of nuclear technology and continue with its efforts to implement the nuclear power programme in the subsequent phases of the programme by using nuclear technology to generate electricity to accelerate national development and industrialisation.\"",
            "According to information from World Nuclear Association, Ghana's Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation in 2021 said five vendors - from the USA, Russia, Canada and South Korea - had responded to a request for interest in helping the country build its first plant, with an expectation that a contract for a 1 GWe plant would be signed sometime in 2024-2025. The USA earlier this year said it is supporting Ghana's adoption of small modular reactor technology under the US Department of State's Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology - or FIRST - programme.",

            "Harry Keeling, Rolls-Royce SMR’s head of industrial markets, called it an \"exciting move forward \" for the firms: \"The potential for the Rolls-Royce SMR to be used for industrial purposes is one of its greatest strengths - being able to deliver large amounts of low-carbon, always-on power, but being flexible enough to be located close to where industry needs it. The production of low-cost hydrogen is a critical step on the pathway to decarbonising our wider society.\"",
            "The Rolls-Royce small modular reactor, a 470 MWe design based on a small pressurised water reactor, has progressed to the second stage of the UK's Generic Design Assessment, the only SMR to reach that stage so far. Although a shortlist of potential sites have been identified for its SMRs, the UK government has launched a competitive process to \"select the best small modular reactor technologies to back\". The second phase - the down-selection process - is due to be launched in the summer, with an ambition to assess and select the leading technologies by Autumn.",

            "As part of a proposed demonstration of small reactor technologies that could take place at Savannah River, GEH and SNRS (partnership between Fluor, Northrop Grumman and Honeywell) signed a memorandum of understanding to consider the Prism design (Power Reactor Innovative Small Module).",
            "The MoU allows for continued discussions on the potential licensing of the Prism reactor design by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and deployment of a 299 MW unit at Savannah River. However, as Savannah River is federally-owned site, it would be possible to construct a prototype unit at the site without having fully completed the NRC's usual licensing procedures. Nevertheless, the regulator would still be closely involved.",
            "A cut-away of a power plant based on the Prism reactor",
            "GE with the US national laboratories had been developing Prism - a modular liquid sodium-cooled inherently-safe reactor – under the Advanced Liquid Metal Reactor/Integral Fast Reactor (ALMR/IFR) program funded by the DoE. That program was cancelled in 1994. However, the 1994 pre-application safety evaluation report for the original Prism design concluded that \"no obvious impediments to licensing the Prism design had been identified.\"",
            "GEH is now touting the Prism design as its Generation IV solution to closing the fuel cycle in the USA. Each Prism power block consists of two modules. The pool-type modules, below ground level, contain the complete primary system with sodium coolant.",
            "A key attribute of Prism technology is that it generates additional electricity from recycling used nuclear fuel. The reactor's fuel - metal plutonium and depleted uranium - is obtained from the used fuel from light water reactors. Fuel stays in the Prism reactor for about six years, with one-third removed every two years. Used Prism fuel is recycled after removal of fission products.",
            "SRNS has been actively working with industry and stakeholder groups on the development of energy security initiatives for DoE to consider at the Savannah River Site (SRS). \"We think Prism can be ideally suited to support one of the SRNS initiatives, as Prism technology has the potential to address many of the nuclear fuel challenges we face today,\" said Caroline Reda, president and CEO of GEH.",
            "Garry Flowers, president and CEO of SRNS, commented: \"We believe that SRS is an ideal place to demonstrate the Prism reactor design as it, and other next generation, small modular reactors, are being considered for the future. Successful deployment of this reactor technology could help the United States be a leader in advanced, small modular reactor technologies and assist in achieving an important goal of the Obama administration for US energy independence.\"",
            "In September, SRNS signed a similar MoU with Hyperion which could lead to the construction of a prototype of Hyperion’s small fast reactor design. The agreement \"envisions collaboration with the Department of Energy (DoE) on an array of technical and policy issues.\"",
            "Also installed underground, the small Hyperion unit would have a thermal capacity of 75 MW. From this it should be possible to generate some 25 MWe, which Hyperion said is \"enough to power a US military base, university or government complex.\"",
            "The Hyperion fast reactor design uses lead bismuth coolant and uranium nitride fuel enriched to almost 20% uranium-235. It would need refuelling only every ten years and this would be done by removing the entire power module, which includes the reactor core and primary coolant loop. At Savannah River the plan is to remove these in standard nuclear transport containers to a specialist facility so that no high-level radioactive materials are stored on site."

However, yesterday's announcements did not confirm the exact level of funding to come from the DoE - which is to be agreed based on negotiation with B&W - nor whether another winner would be announced. The program was modelled after the Nuclear Power 2010 program which accelerated the design and licensing of Westinghouse's AP1000 reactor.",
            "At less than 300 MWe in capacity, SMRs are much smaller than typical nuclear reactors and are considered an ideal choice for areas which can't support a larger reactor. The DoE notes that an SMR's compact scalable design offers a host of potential safety, construction and economic benefits.",

            "CNL said the invitation represents the launch of its SMR review process, including the pre-qualification stage, which allows CNL to evaluate the \"technical and business merits of proposed designs, assess the financial viability of the projects, and review the necessary national security and integrity requirements\".",
            "The invitation follows CNL's request for expressions of interest in SMRs, launched last June, which resulted in responses from 80 organisations around the world, including 19 expressions of interest in siting a prototype or demonstration reactor at a CNL-managed site. National nuclear science and technology organisation CNL last year set a goal of siting a new SMR on its Chalk River site by 2026.",

            "Applications to the invitation will proceed through a four-stage process. Following the pre-qualification stage, which will assess proponents against preliminary criteria, applicants must complete a due diligence stage, which will require more stringent financial requirements and a full assessment of funding and project costs. The third stage, negotiation of land arrangement and other contracts, would lead to the signing of a site disposition agreement with AECL. In the final stage, project execution, the SMR unit would be licensed, constructed, tested and commissioned, operated and decommissioned.",

            "In February, Canada launched a process to prepare a roadmap to explore the potential of on- and off-grid applications for SMR technology. The roadmap - part of Natural Resources Canada's Energy Innovation Program - is aimed at helping position Canada to become a global leader in the emerging SMR market. Driven by interested provincial and territorial governments and energy utilities, the exercise will be delivered by the Canadian Nuclear Association. It will engage stakeholders to better understand their views on priorities and challenges related to the possible development and deployment of SMRs in Canada. The roadmap is expected to be completed later this year."

            "General Atomics (GA) has now confirmed that it is one of several SMR developers to have submitted proposals in the second round. Its proposal is for the EM2, a modified version of its Gas-Turbine Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR) design.",
            "The EM2 employs a 500 MWt, 265 MWe helium-cooled fast-neutron high-temperature reactor operating at 850°C. This would be factory manufactured and transported to the plant site by truck. According to GA, the EM2 reactor would be fuelled with 20 tonnes of used PWR fuel or depleted uranium, plus 22 tonnes of uranium enriched to about 12% U-235 as the starter.",
            "It is designed to operate for 30 years without requiring refuelling, the company said. Used fuel from the EM2 could be processed to remove fission products (about 4 tonnes) and the balance then recycled as fuel for subsequent cycles, each time topped up with four tonnes of used PWR fuel. The module also incorporates a truck-transportable high-speed gas turbine generator.",
            "General Atomics has been the primary developer of modular helium-cooled nuclear power reactor systems, while its TRIGA research reactors have operated around the world for over 45 years. GA has teamed up with Chicago Bridge & Iron, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Idaho National Laboratory to develop the EM2.",
            "Senior vice president of GA's energy and advanced concepts group John Parmentola commented, \"We welcome the opportunity to join the Department of Energy in advancing the next generation of nuclear technology for reliable and cost-effective clean energy, for this century and beyond.\"",
            "In November 2012, the Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) mPower reactor was selected as the winner of the first round of funding, receiving access to $79 million to commercially demonstrate the design by 2022. A second round of funding was announced in March 2013. The DoE anticipates awarding those funds by mid-January 2014. The maximum amount available in each of the first and second rounds is set at $226 million.",
            "Other SMR developers who have already announced that they submitted proposals by the 1 July deadline include Westinghouse, Holtec International, NuScale and Hybrid Power Technologies."

            "NuScale was one of a number of SMR projects to apply for the five-year cost-share funding opportunity, announced by the DoE in March 2013. The specific total of the funding is to be negotiated by the DoE and NuScale, and will come from the DoE's total pot of $452 million earmarked for technical support of SMR licensing. Industrial partners will be expected to at least match the DoE's investment.",
            "US energy secretary Ernest Moniz said that SMRs represented a new generation of safe, reliable, low-carbon nuclear energy technology. \"The Energy Department is committed to strengthening nuclear energy’s continuing important role in America’s low carbon future, and new technologies like small modular reactors will help ensure our continued leadership in the safe, secure and efficient use of nuclear power worldwide,\" he said. A first round of DoE SMR funding was awarded to Babcock & Wilcox's mPower reactor in November 2012.",
            "The DoE says its investment will help NuScale to obtain design certification from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission with a view to achieving commercialisation around 2025. The reactors are to be built domestically in the USA, and the project will be based in the state of Oregon where NuScale has its headquarters.",
            "NuScale originated as a spin-off company based on research work at Oregon State University, but its majority investor is US energy and power company Fluor. Fluor group president for global business development and strategy, Dave Dunning, said the company was \"extremely pleased\" by the DoE's funding decision, saying that it validated the company's 2011 decision to invest in NuScale. According to Fluor, the companies are evaluating potential investors, manufacturers and supply chain partners for future potential SMR development efforts. As well as Fluor, NuScale is supported by British engineering company Rolls-Royce which has a strong manufacturing base in the USA.",
            "Various different SMR concepts are being developed around the world. At up to 300 MWe, they are around one-third of the size of conventional nuclear power plants and as well as enhanced safety and ease of manufacturing and construction their compact, scalable designs offer potential benefits over larger reactors in various circumstances, for example in remote locations.",
            "NuScale's SMR is a 45 MWe self-contained pressurized water reactor and generator set, which would be factory made and shipped for deployment in sets of up to 12 to make scalable nuclear power plants with capacities from 45 MWe to 540 MWe. Using conventional fuel assemblies, the core would be cooled by natural circulation, requiring fewer components and safety systems than conventional reactors."

The performance of the HCSG was tested over the expected range of reactor operating conditions.",
            "Pressurised water reactors use steam generators to transfer the heat from the reactor coolant – the primary circuit – to heat water in a secondary circuit to make steam to power the electricity generation turbines. They do this by circulating the reactor coolant through thousands of tubes, typically about 2cm in diameter, which are surrounded by the water of the secondary circuit. In conventional nuclear power plants, steam generators are huge components, typically weighing up to 800 tonnes, with the tubes in either a vertical or horizontal configuration and relying on pumps to keep the coolant circulating.",

It relies on gravity, not pumps, to circulate the water in the primary circuit up through a riser above the core and down through the HCSG, which as its name suggests contains tubes in a spiral configuration. After passing through the HCSG, the cooled water is pulled down by gravity to the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel where it is drawn through the core again. A single module can generate up to 45 MWe of electricity and is just under 25m in length, 4.6m in diameter and weighing around 450 tonnes.",

            "The Tennessee Valley Authority has submitted an Early Site Permit (ESP) application for small modular reactor units at Clinch River, Tennessee, to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).",
            "The ESP application for the 1200 acre (486 hectare) site near Oak Ridge is the first SMR-related application of any type to be submitted to the NRC, TVA chief nuclear officer Joe Grimes said. \"It’s a significant event for us as we continue exploring potential SMR technology as a way of expanding our diverse portfolio,\" he added.",
            "SMRs can generally be described as nuclear reactors with a typical capacity of 300 MWe equivalent or less, designed with modular technology and using module factory fabrication, allowing economies of series production and short construction times.",
            "An ESP certifies that a site is suitable for the construction of a nuclear power plant from the point of view of site safety, environmental impact and emergency planning and is valid for ten to 20 years. As well as reviewing those aspects of the site, the NRC's ESP application review process also provides opportunities for public participation. An ESP does not specify any choice of technology.",
            "TVA's senior manager for SMRs, Dan Stout, said the company was \"still several years away\" from any potential construction decision.",
            "TVA's application and subsequent work on the review and approval process is being co-funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) under a five-year inter-agency agreement finalized in July 2015. The department has been actively supporting the development and commercial deployment of SMRs, which it sees playing an important role in addressing the country's energy security, economic and climate goals. TVA said submission of the permit application is \"firmly aligned\" with the DOE's strategic goal.",
            "As well as its agreement with TVA, the DOE is also supporting NuScale and Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems in site characterization activities at the Idaho National Laboratory under a three-year cost-shared cooperative agreement finalized in August 2015.",
            "TVA, a government-owned corporation, has three nuclear power plants in its electricity generation portfolio - Browns Ferry, Sequoyah and Watts Bar - which produce some 30% of its electricity. It is preparing to start up Watts Bar unit 2. Earlier this month it announced plans to sell off the partially constructed nuclear power plant at Bellefonte in Alabama as it did not anticipate needing any new large-scale baseload capacity for at least the next 20 years, though it would continue to explore SMRs as a potential long-term resource."

            "The signing of the MoU between KHNP and KNPP (Image: KHNP)",
            "The MoU was signed in Seoul on 28 June during a visit of a Kazakh delegation led by Vice Minister of Energy Zhandos Nurmaganbetov and representatives of the South Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, as well as KHNP. Their trip included a tour of units 5 and 6 of the Shin Kori plant, which are currently under construction.",
            "Through the MoU, the two companies have agreed to cooperate in areas such as the development of new nuclear power plants, the application of nuclear technology, human resource training and public acceptance.",
            "\"The signing of this Memorandum will strengthen the strategic partnership between Kazakhstan and South Korea in the field of nuclear energy development,\" Kazakhstan's energy ministry said.",
            "KNHP noted that it submitted a proposal to Kazakhstan in 2019 for the construction of two 1000 MWe or 1400 MWe nuclear power plants. Since then, the company said it has \"maintained a continuous cooperative relationship\".",
            "In September last year, Kazakh president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced as part of a national address that Samruk-Kazya would begin exploring the use of nuclear energy. He said it would \"explore the possibility of developing safe and environmentally friendly nuclear energy in Kazakhstan\" and that it would be done \"as rationally as possible, without speculation and emotions\".",
            "In December, KNPP signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with small modular reactor (SMR) developer NuScale to investigate the deployment of SMRs in Kazakhstan. NuScale said the agreement will see the companies share technical expertise as they \"examine the value NuScale's small modular reactor technology could bring to the country.\" The US company will support KNPP to evaluate its technology, \"including nuclear power plant engineering, construction, commissioning, operation and maintenance, and project-specific studies and design work.\" In 2019, NuScale submitted a 'technical and price offer' to KNPP.",
            "In February this year, Kazkhstan's Energy Director of the Department of Nuclear Energy and Industry said that the government was evaluating six suppliers: NuScale Power; a US-Japanese consortium of GE Hitachi; KHNP; China National Nuclear Corporation; Rosatom; and EDF.",
            "reported on 29 June that the Kazakh Energy Ministry has excluded the USA and Japan from the list of potential suppliers of technology for the nuclear power plant project as their proposed reactors have not yet been constructed or operated anywhere elsewhere yet.",
            "KNPP is preparing to submit a proposal for a new nuclear power plant to the president within the third quarter of this year for the construction of two new nuclear power plants with a total capacity of up to 2800 MWe.",
            "Kazakhstan has 12% of the world's uranium resources and is the world's largest producer. A Russian-designed BN-350 sodium-cooled fast reactor operated near Aktau in Kazakhstan for 26 years until 1999, generating electricity and desalinating water. The question of nuclear power in Kazakhstan has been discussed for many years, with both large and small reactors included in various draft energy plans over the last decade.",

            "The IMSR plant is a small modular reactor designed for industrial cogeneration as well as high-efficiency, grid-based power generation, and can produce cost-competitive, high-temperature thermal energy with zero greenhouse gas emissions, the company said. It is \"ideally suited\" for natural resource extraction, low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia production, and many other energy-intensive industrial activities, and has \"unique potential\" to supply the heat and power needs of activities including those in the Alberta oil and gas, and petrochemical sectors, it added. Already employing more than 100 personnel in its Ontario operation, the company said it anticipates supporting high-quality jobs as it expands its activities in western Canada.",
            "\"There is great potential for SMRs to provide zero-emission energy for industrial operations in remote areas and further reduce emissions from Alberta's oil sands,\" Alberta's Minister of Energy Sonya Savage said. \"We're proud of our industry's ongoing history of responsible energy development and innovation, and grateful to Terrestrial Energy for supporting job creation and economic growth in Alberta.\"",
            "Simon Irish, CEO of Terrestrial Energy, said the IMSR cogeneration plant, with its Generation IV SMR technology, \"provides a clear pathway for Alberta industry to achieve net zero, and develop production capabilities for industrial leadership in a net-zero energy economy of the future.\" The province's continued policies supporting industrial innovation and economic growth make Alberta attractive to the company, he added.",
            "Alberta's upstream energy sector includes oil sands (sometimes called tar sands), conventional oil and gas, and mining and quarrying, employing over 140,000 people. Bitumen royalties make the largest contribution to provincial resource royalty revenue, with bitumen revenues totalling some CAD11.61 billion (USD9 billion) in 2021-22. But the bitumen in oil sands does not flow like conventional crude oil, so must be mined or heated underground using steam - produced using natural gas - and further processed to recover bitumen from sand. Alberta represented 56% of total Canadian demand for natural gas in 2020, according to the Canada Energy Regulator, consuming almost seven times more natural gas per day than the residential and commercial sectors combined.",

The reactor can respond to changes in energy demand - automatically entering an idle state or returning rapidly to full power - making it an ideal complement to wind and solar power. Conventional reactors, it said, are not suited to rapidly changing their output.",
            "According to MoltexFLEX, the cost of electricity generated by the FLEX reactor is comparable to that of wind, at just GBP40 (USD44) per MWh. This is achieved through a unique, patented system which uses two molten salts: one acting as a fuel, whilst the other circulates as a coolant. This allows the heat from the reactor to be extracted through natural convection, without the need for pumps.",
            "The FLEX reactor is small and modular, allowing components to be factory-produced and readily transportable, reducing on-site work, increasing speed of construction, and minimising overall costs. It is passively safe, so does not require engineered, redundant, active safety systems.",
            "A cutaway of the FLEX reactor (Image: MoltexFLEX)",
            "Once online, the FLEX reactor can be operated with the same skills and equipment used in a fossil fuel plant. The reactor has no moving parts and is fuelled for 20 years at a time, meaning that there is very little operator input and very low ongoing costs.",
            "Each reactor delivers 40 MW of thermal energy at 700°C. This heat is stored in MoltexFLEX's GridReserve thermal storage tanks, so that the power plant can deliver three times the power when renewables alone cannot meet the market need for electricity.",
            "During longer periods of high renewable generation, the FLEX reactor can simply move passively into idle mode - producing just enough heat to keep the reactor at operating temperature.",

            "The CIB's investment will finance Phase 1 work, covering all preparations prior to nuclear construction including project design, site preparation, procurement of long lead-time equipment, utility connections, implementation of a digital strategy, and related project management costs.",
            "The CIB is a federal Crown corporation mandated to invest CAD35 billion over ten years in infrastructure which benefit Canadians. CIB CEO Ehren Cory said a project like the Darlington New Nuclear plant delivers significant outcomes. \"As our largest clean power investment, we are supporting technology which can accelerate the reduction in greenhouse gases while also paving the way for Canada becoming a global SMR technology hub,\" he said.",
            "The bank supports infrastructure projects by sharing risks and by providing long-term low-cost, stable finance, he said during the announcement event, which was held on the site where the new plant will be built. \"The goal here is to get the technology built while making sure that it's affordable to Ontario rate-payers over the long term, so our loan helps reduce the total delivered cost of the project in a meaningful way that makes the project that much more competitive.\"",
            "\"We know nuclear energy, including from SMRs, is an essential part of the electricity mix to help meet our climate change goals. This low-interest financing helps us advance the Darlington New Nuclear Project, paving the way for development and deployment of the next generation of nuclear power in Canada,\" OPG President and CEO Ken Hartwick said.",
            "As well as providing financial certainty, he said, the CIB's support also signals support by the federal government for the project, he said: \"This project will be competitive with any other form of technology.\"",
            "Once built, the Darlington SMR will avoid around 740,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year, according to OPG. It is also expected to spearhead similar projects in Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Alberta, and will also support Canadian efforts to become a global SMR technology hub in a market estimated to be CAD150 billion per year by 2040.",
            "With an approved Environmental Assessment already in place, the site is the only location in Canada currently licensed for new nuclear.",

            "The conference adopted the #PoweredByNuclear tag (Image: IAEA)",
            "\"The topical discussions we had over the past three days, I think, encapsulate very well the opportunities and the challenges we have ahead of us,\" Grossi said as he closed the conference, attended by more than 800 participants including ministers, senior officials, policy makers and experts from 69 countries and nine international organisations. \"In four years, another conference like this will take place; let's make it our commitment that many of the things that we said during these days in Washington needed to be done, are going to be already well under way. It is not only the good thing to do. It is what we all need.\"",
            "Participants in the conference's high-level talks had agreed that nuclear power, which emits no greenhouse gases during operation, can make a significant contribution to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement, said US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said as she closed the conference alongside Grossi.",
            "Nuclear power is currently the only low carbon technology that can produce electricity and heat at scale, she said: \"It produces electricity at predictable costs. And it enables the massive expansion of wind and solar by providing dispatchable power and stabilising grids. That makes it an attractive and reliable source of scalable power, which can support economic development, while helping meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.\"",
            "At the start of the conference Grossi said the convergence of the global climate and energy crises had driven up fuel prices in many regions and highlighted the need for clean and secure supplies of energy, reviving interest in nuclear power. The conference ended a day after the release of a United Nations Environment Programme",
            "on the world's efforts to prevent global warming from crossing the threshold into catastrophic climate change stated there is currently no credible pathway in place to limit temperature rises to 1.5°C and said only an urgent system-wide transformation can avoid an accelerating climate disaster.",
            "Nuclear power plants are currently operated in 32 countries, providing some 10% of the world's electricity and accounting for 25% of its clean electricity, and the IAEA said it is supporting around 30 more that are embarking on, or considering, the introduction of nuclear power.",
            "\"Several demonstration plants and first-of-a-kind SMR (small modular reactor) units are expected to begin operating in the coming years,\" Granholm said. \"Governments and public-private partnerships provide human and financial resources and create favourable conditions to advance these kinds of demonstration projects.\"",

Operator PG&E earlier this month formally asked the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to resume work on relicensing the plants to enable them to continue operating until 2030.",
            "\"This is a critical step toward ensuring that our domestic nuclear fleet will continue providing reliable and affordable power to Americans as the nation's largest source of clean electricity,\" US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said. \"Nuclear energy will help us meet President Biden's climate goals, and with these historic investments in clean energy, we can protect these facilities and the communities they serve.\"",
            "The conditional award of credits creates a path forward for Diablo Canyon - which produces around 16 GWh of electricity annually, about 15% of California's clean energy - to stay open, DOE said, as well as saving 1,500 clean energy jobs.",
            "DOE's announcement came after Holtec International announced that its bid for funding to reopen the Palisades plant in Michigan had been unsuccessful. The plant closed down in May after more than 50 years in operation.",
            "Holtec agreed in 2018 to purchase the plant for decommissioning from operator Entergy, completing the acquisition in June. In July, Holtec - with the support of Governor of Michigan Gretchen Whitmer  - submitted an application for funding under the CNC programme in July, just days after completing its acquisition of the plant.",
            "Holtec said the news was \"unfortunate\" and shared a statement from Pat O'Brien, Director Government Affairs and Communications for Holtec International. \"We fully understood that what we were attempting to do, re-starting a shuttered nuclear plant, would be both a challenge and a first for the nuclear industry,\" he said. \"While the DOE's decision is not the outcome many had hoped for, we entered this process committed to working with our federal, state, and community partners to see if the plant could be repowered to return to service as a provider of safe, reliable, and carbon-free generation.\"",
            "\"Holtec remains committed to helping the nuclear and energy industries meet challenges and find solutions here in Michigan and across the country. That commitment remains as our employees focus on the safe and timely decommissioning of Palisades to allow for potential reuse,\" O'Brien added.",

Holtec's acquisition of the plant - together with the decommissioned Big Rock Point nuclear power plant, where a dry fuel storage facility remains - was completed later that month. At that time, Holtec said it envisaged a 19-year timeline for the Palisades decommissioning project, with the transfer of fuel from wet to dry storage to be completed by 2025 and complete decommissioning of the plant (with the exception of the dry storage facility) by 2041.",
            "Following decommissioning, most of the site - except for the area occupied by the dry storage facility - will be available for industrial use. Holtec has previously said that installation of a plant based on its SMR-160 small modular reactor could be a viable repurposing of the site.",

            "Investigations into the properties of molten salts, progress towards the construction of a Versatile Test Reactor and the return to service of Idaho National Laboratory's Transient Reactor Test Facility also featured in Brouillette's list, as did efforts to provide pathways to the High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel that future advanced reactors will require. The DOE was \"looking into multiple options\" to provide small amounts of HALEU in the near-term to support the testing and demonstration of these technologies by recycling excess US government nuclear fuel.",
            "\"We are also working toward long-term solutions by demonstrating the ability to enrich uranium to HALEU levels using 16 advanced centrifuge machines,\" he added.",

            "\"NICE Future is a global effort led by the United States, Canada, and Japan that will ensure nuclear energy receives appropriate representation in high-level discussions about clean energy, as well as promotes international collaboration on advanced nuclear technologies,\" he said, adding that it had already engaged experts from more than 35 countries and 80 organisations to foster innovative thinking on future nuclear power uses and applications in clean energy systems.",
            "\"These 11 examples demonstrate the Administration's commitment to civilian nuclear energy and an 'all-of-the-above' energy approach,\" he said. \"They prove we can expand our energy production, secure our energy independence, and create more opportunities for the American people.\"",

            "Nuclear power is \"irreplaceable\" and international cooperation in the technology \"indispensible\" in reducing global CO2 emissions, China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) President Jun Gu told delegates at the International Atomic Energy Agency's",
            "International Conference on Climate Change and the Role of Nuclear Power",
            "yesterday in Vienna. Climate change may in fact be an \"opportunity to create a new era for nuclear energy\", he said, and CNNC is \"willing to work with all countries\" to bring about a clean energy transition and mitigate climate change.",
            "CNNC President Gu Jun speaking at the IAEA conference (Image: CNNC)",
            "Of the 449 reactor units in operation in 30 countries today, 47 are in",
            ", he noted. At nearly 50 GWe, they place the country in third ranking in terms of installed nuclear generating capacity. China also has 11 units under construction with an installed capacity of about 12 GWe, ranking the country first in the world in that respect, he said. In 2018, nuclear power generated 287 TWh of electricity in China, accounting for 4.2% of national power generation, and Gu is \"fully confident\" that China will add a further 6-8 units each year over the next 10 years.",
            "\"With technological progress, the world is entering an age of clean energy with less dependence on fossil fuel,\" Gu said. \"The shares of natural gas, nuclear energy, solar power, wind power and hydropower in energy production and in consumption are increasing markedly. In some countries, clean energy takes about 60% of the energy mix. However, we think that hydropower is highly restricted by regional resources, and wind and solar power also have natural constraints. They can hardly be the main power producers without a breakthrough in energy storage technology. Also, nuclear power has been demonstrated as an important option in replacing coal-fired power plants on a large scale. Nuclear power is an important baseload option to avoid price fluctuation and the grid risk from renewable energy.\"",
            "China is committed to cutting its CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65% from the 2005 level by 2030, he said, and plans to increase the share of non-fossil fuel energy in its primary energy mix to 15% by 2020 and to 20% by 2030.",
            "Since Chinese President Xi Jinping launched the country's new energy policy in 2014, \"tremendous changes\" have been made, Gu said. \"The past three years have witnessed the fastest growth of renewable energy in China, which now ranks first in installed capacity of hydro, wind and solar power, as well as in nuclear power construction.\"",
            "The country's international cooperation in nuclear power is clear, he said, since it has reactor designs that include French PWRs, Canadian Candus, Russian VVERs and US AP1000s. It is also working on its own design, the HPR-1000, and is developing indigenous equipment supply.",
            "\"We have developed the capacity to manufacture equipment for eight to 10 units every year,\" he said. \"At present, more than 85% of the key equipment and materials of our own HPR-1000 can be produced in China.\"",
            "The HPR-1000, also known as Hualong One, is a Chinese pressurised water reactor design developed by CNNC and the China General Nuclear Power Group. The first HPR-1000 units to be constructed will be Fuqing units 5 and 6, followed by Fangjiashan units 3 and 4, and Fangchenggang units 3 and 4. There are five Hualong One reactors planned for Pakistan - four at Karachi and one at Chashma, of which two are under construction at Karachi. Construction of another HPR-1000 is planned to start next year in Argentina.",
            "The HPR-1000 project is \"progressing smoothly\", Gu said, adding that Fuqing 5 had entered the commissioning stage and would achieve power operation by the first-half of next year.",
            "CNNC is working on new nuclear technologies, he said, including small modular reactors, nuclear waste transmutation and treatment, accident-tolerant fuel, high-temperature reactors, fast breeder reactors, nuclear fusion technology, and used fuel disposal.",
            "In July, CNNC announced the launch of a project to construct an ACP100 small modular reactor at Changjiang in Hainan province. Construction of the demonstration unit - also referred to as the Linglong One design - is scheduled to begin by the end of this year.",
            "Its HTR-PM, a 200-megawatt high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, can supply industrial heat of above 750 degrees Celsius, he said, and is expected to have \"broader prospects\" in hydrogen production. The unit will be in operation by the end of next year, \"laying a solid foundation for further commercial application\", he added. In addition, CNNC has developed the Yanlong DHR-400 pool-type low-temperature reactor in northern China to replace the fossil fuel-fired district heating system. The company is also working with 'Belt-and-Road countries' in nuclear power, uranium resources, nuclear fuel, and the non-power applications of nuclear technology. And it is engaged in the ITER fusion project in the south of France.",
            "International cooperation, he said, can \"build consensus and strengthen confidence\" in nuclear power.",
            "\"The global nuclear industry is moving out of the shadow of Fukushima accident. However some countries have abandoned nuclear power and sharply dropped its proportion in their generation mix,\" he said. \"Developed countries have witnessed sluggish growth of nuclear power - except for six units in Finland, France, the US and the UK, no other nuclear power plant had been built in North America and the EU area for about 30 years. Over the same period however about 100 units were built in developing and emerging economies.\"",

            "expand energy choice, says Perry",
            "Nuclear power can help nations attain energy security, diversity and decarbonisation, and the USA is \"ready and willing\" to offer its technology to achieve this, US Energy Secretary Rick Perry told a US-EU High-Level Industrial Forum this week.",
            "Perry (L) and Cañete (R) pictured at the Brussels forum (Image: EC)",
            "\"By sharing our nuclear energy technologies, we are breathing new life into that great and noble vision first unveiled to the world by President Eisenhower. A vision to convert nuclear power into peaceful energy for the whole of humanity,\" Perry said in a keynote address to the first",
            "US-EU High-Level Industrial Forum on SMRs",
            "which was held in Brussels on 21 October. \"We are reaffirming nuclear energy as an indispensable source of energy for the world,\" he added.",
            "The USA is supporting this vision by efforts to increase the longevity and performance of today's nuclear reactors, developments including accident tolerant fuels and other technologies, and programmes such as the Department of Energy's (DOE) Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) initiative to bring new reactor technologies to market. The DOE has long been involved in the development of small modular reactor (SMR) technology, Perry said, citing joint research between the Idaho National Laboratory and Oregon State University which ultimately led to the development of SMR company NuScale.",
            "SMRs retain \"every advantage\" of existing large-scale reactors - they are clean, reliable, and can store multiple years of fuel onsite - but also have \"powerful advantages\" of their own, Perry said: \"They're smaller, they're more flexibile, they require less capital investment, they can be placed in remote locations ... They can power everything from military bases to remote villages and islands beset by tropical storms and hurricanes.\"",
            "For the countries of Europe and the USA, SMRs and other advanced reactors, in providing a boost for nuclear energy, will also enhance energy reliability and security. Energy secure means economically secure, while energy security also bolsters national security, Perry said.",
            "\"When nations have secure energy sources, they can't be controlled by other countries wielding that energy as a geopolitical weapon. In a very real way, small modular reactors can be another tool to help vulnerable nations take control of their destinies,\" he said.",
            "SMRs could potentially play a key role in less developed countries, he said, especially in \"vast tracts\" of the globe where the population has no, or only intermittent, access to electricity.",
            "\"We can change that grim reality, we can disperse the darkness … Let us partner together across the Atlantic and finally make [the] dream of peaceful nuclear energy a full-blown reality for every part of this world.\"",
            "The high-level forum, which was jointly hosted by the European Commission (EC) and DOE, brought together policy makers, Members of the European Parliament, business stakeholders and independent regulators to discuss EU-US technology leadership and cooperation in SMRs.",
            "In his keynote speech, Miguel Arias Cañete, Member of the EC in charge of Climate Action and Energy said the event opened avenues for transatlantic cooperation in new, low-carbon and innovative nuclear technologies. On a global scale, there is now \"tangible progress\" with SMRs, he said, adding that SMRs are a \"promising technological solution\" for reducing carbon emissions but are also characterised by high cost efficiency and high levels of safety.",
            "The potential benefits of SMRs include their lower financial risks, enhanced safety including passive or inherent safety features, reduced risk of core damage and reduced core size, and greater siting flexibility than large-scale plants, Cañete said. However, the deployment of SMRs faces challenges from: the need for regulatory scrutiny of their safety and security features; the risk of physical protection for non-proliferation purposes; and a need for the deployment of SMR technology to be done in a \"safe and transparent\" way with cooperation and dialogue between industry, utilities, member states, civil society and the European Commission.",
            "International collaboration in the development of new and innovative nuclear technologies is necessary and should include areas such as licensing and safety, Cañete said. Joint US-EU actions on SMRs would be a good example of nuclear cooperation and could cover topics such as research and innovation, potential uses of SMRs for decarbonisation, and licensing, he added.",

            "How a NuScale SMR plant could look (Image: NuScale)",
            "NuScale's application for certification of its SMR design for use in the USA was submitted on 31 December, 2016 and was accepted by the NRC the following March. NRC said its completion of the technical review within its original 42-month schedule demonstrates its commitment to \"timely\" licensing of new, advanced reactor technology.",
            "\"This is a significant milestone not only for NuScale, but also for the entire US nuclear sector and the other advanced nuclear technologies that will follow. This clearly establishes the leadership of NuScale and the US in the race to bring SMRs to market,\" said NuScale Chairman and CEO John Hopkins. He also credited strong bipartisan support from US Congress for the project, which received cost-shared federal funding as it advanced through the NRC Design Certification process.",
            "NuScale said it had spent over USD500 million, with the backing of its majority investor Fluor, and over 2 million labour hours to develop the information needed to prepare its design certification application. The company also submitted 14 separate Topical Reports in addition to the application - itself over 12,000 pages long - and provided more than 2 million pages of supporting information for NRC audits.",
            "The NuScale design uses passive processes such as convection and gravity in its operating systems and safety features to produce about 600 MW of electricity. Twelve modules, each producing 50 MW, are submerged in a safety-related pool built below ground level. The NRC has concluded the design's passive features \"will ensure the nuclear power plant would shut down safely and remain safe under emergency conditions, if necessary\", it said. NuScale has also indicated to NRC it will apply for standard design approval of a version using 60 MW modules, the regulator said. This would require additional NRC review.",
            "Design certification means the NRC has, after thorough examination of compliance with safety requirements, approved a nuclear power plant design independent of an application to construct or operate a plant. Full certification allows a utility to reference the design when applying for a combined licence to build and operate a nuclear power plant anywhere in the USA, although site-specific licensing procedures must still be completed and a combined construction and operating licence obtained before construction can begin. Design certification is valid for 15 years from the date of issuance, but can be renewed for an additional 10 to 15 years.",

            "Small modular reactors (SMRs) will be an excellent fit in a carbon-free energy future which will require all energy sources to work together, but they must be cost-competitive with other forms of electricity generation, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy President and CEO Jay Wileman told participants in World Nuclear Association's",
            "Jay Wileman at the Strategic eForum (Image: World Nuclear Association)",
            "Speaking during a high-level panel on",
            "Maximising nuclear energy's socio-economic and environmental benefits",
            ", Wileman said the company had innovated to bring down the cost of its SMR through simplification of systems, advanced concrete solutions, and construction techniques, as well as leveraging its existing, proven supply chain and components, to target deployment by 2028.",
            "The carbon-free energy future is \"absolutely\" going to require all different types of energy sources to work together to provide a stable grid, with reliable operation and cost-optimised power prices, Wileman said.",
            "Nuclear has traditionally been seen as only a baseload operation, running 24/7 and producing reliable, carbon-free power, he said. \"That has been the mainstay of our message, and that's what we have been delivering. However, as we start to see the increase in penetration of renewables, you will need to acknowledge the ability for nuclear not to just be baseload, but to load-follow: something that is not typically thought of with a nuclear reactor.",
            "\"I think that, looking forward, small modular reactors are excellently fit for that purpose, and the ability to follow the output of renewables and load-follow on the grid,\" he said.",
            "Nuclear could be \"more than just zero-carbon, reliable, dispatchable power\" but must be at the right price, he said. The high capex and overnight costs of current nuclear builds make it very difficult for private companies to support such projects on their balance sheet, Wileman said.",
            "\"What if you could build a small modular reactor of 300 MW for USD1 billion or less?\" he asked. \"What if you could build a nuclear plant where the possibility of a large LOCA [loss of coolant accident] was totally eliminated? Imagine all the safety equipment in today's designs, that wouldn't be required for the safe operation of that plant. What if you could figure out how to take advantage of those and simplify a plant such that it requires 90% less safety-related concrete and 50% less concrete per MW?\"",
            "This is the approach GE-Hitachi has taken in designing the BWRX-300, which Wileman described as a \"design-to-cost\" exercise. BWRX-300 is based on the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission-certified 1,520 MWe Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) design.",
            "\"We're not stand-alone - we are in an ecosystem of electricity generation,\" he said. \"We've taken a lot of this work and we've simplified things - the advanced concrete and construction techniques - and we're also moving back away from nuclear-specific design and going to catalogue items, and leveraging a lot of the supply chain that we've already got instead of having to stand up a new one, as well as using already existing and operating fuel designs, which are already in use in over 70% of the BWRs around the world.\"",
            "According to material published by GE-Hitachi, the ESBWR has about 160,000 cubic metres of safety-related concrete while the BWRX-300 has only 15,500 cubic metres.  Most of the nuclear-related technology and components used in the plant either have had many years of proven operation experience or have undergone significant testing and licensing as part of the ESBWR programme, while advanced concrete solutions and innovative techniques incorporated in the design have been proved in the oil and gas, tunnelling and power industries.",
            "The flexibility of SMRs also means they will be able to support a variety of activities beyond electricity generation, providing cost-competitive and environmentally friendly power for uses such as hydrogen production, desalination, district heating and industrial use, Wileman said, highlighting GE-Hitachi's ongoing discussions with Polish manufacturer Synthos on using the BWRX-300 to meet that company's electricity needs.",
            "GE-Hitachi is on track to bring BWRX-300 to the market by 2028, Wileman said, adding: \"I really am excited about moving from 'What if?', to really getting it done\"",

            "In an interview for the World Nuclear News podcast NexGen Energy CEO and President Leigh Curyer set out the path ahead for what he calls their world-leading project in Canada, and gave his overview of the uranium sector's prospects.",
            "Here is an edited transcript of parts of the",
            "podcast, which you can also listen to via the embedded player below or",
            "We founded NexGen Energy in 2011 and acquired a number of exploration properties in the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan. The deposits in the Athabasca Basin are on average 100 times the grade of the current grade of world production so you're looking for very high grade deposits, but they're very difficult to find. We were very fortunate after looking at a 30-year history of exploration in the area and then applying some new geophysical surveys over the land package we targeted a number of zones in that southwestern side of the basin and on our 21st drill hole on the property, but the very first drill hole on this particular target, we hit mineralisation. It wasn't until mid-2014, about six months after that discovery hole, that we we then hit an intercept which at the time was about the fourth best hole in uranium exploration history from a width-times-grade perspective - that hole is no longer in the top 20, the other holes [which have superseded it] are all hosted by the Arrow discovery. At that time we knew we had something incredibly significant. We knew it was one of the world's best deposits, and it certainly has turned into the world's best deposit from a grade, size and also technical environmental setting.",
            "How long will it take to get to production?",
            "Mining does take many years and we have just hit the 10 year anniversary from that discovery. We received our Saskatchewan provincial environmental approval in November and we're confident that we will receive the federal permit in the very near future. The timeline on construction is estimated to be 42 months from that point in time. If we were to receive the federal permit in 2024, you would expect production at the end of 2027, early 2028. So from discovery through to production, you're looking around 14 or 15 years.",
            "Innovative approaches to the licensing and permitting side",
            "Our approach has been, first of all, understanding what is required to be permitted. So even before we submitted our original project description, we put a lot of work into understanding the permitting process in Canada, the level of validation required around the technical, the environmental and the social aspects of environmental approval. And we ran that process provincially in Saskatchewan, in parallel to the federal approval process in Canada. The fact is, the environmental impact study, is primarily the same document, both provincially and federally, and there's licensing as well as the environmental approval which we have run in parallel. We've had that benefit of having a well understood ore body, it's incredibly hard rock, so it's very easy to extract ... we don't have deleterious metals once we get the ore to the surface to then deal with, so it has been innovative in that sense that we've run a few a number of streams in parallel and have received validation around it with the granting of the provincial approval. And we're confident we're about to receive that federally as well.",
            "The uranium market and its impact on NexGen Energy",
            "Over the last year or two it has certainly been quite lively after a long dormant period. A lot of people have asked me how it feels to discover the world's best project in one of the world's worst markets. And from my perspective, and also the team's perspective at NexGen, that was OK with us because it actually allowed us to get on with developing the project to the stage that we have, without being distracted with all the market noise that happens with a rising uranium price. It's been 10 years since discovery and in that time, up until the last two years, the uranium market has been pretty quiet. Our confidence was that this market was always coming, with respect to demand increasing, yet mined supply is the most fragile it's ever been and the costs of producing from those current mines are going up substantially ... this has been building since 2011 and and you just can't turn on mined supply overnight - we've got one of the simplest projects technically on the planet, and yet it's still going to be a 15-year process from discovery through to actual production. We weren't the only ones to recognise it - uranium fund holders such as Yellow Cake in the UK and Sprott Uranium Trust in North America, they saw the Western world's leading producers buying spot pounds on the market because it was cheaper than those mines could produce it themselves - and when do you ever see that in a commodity, let alone an energy commodity, so they recognised the trade and started buying. They have also been correct. I think the fundamentals are now locked in for uranium for longer than they weren't. Our project, which will be the world's largest, at about 25% of the world's mined supply, is just replacing mined supply that is expected to come off between now and when we're in production. 30 million pounds is what our feasibility engineering study has scheduled and that's coming from a very tiny mine. We are moving the ore [equivalent to the volume] of about one double decker bus, one and a half double decker buses a day - that's a reflection of the incredible grade.",
            "How long will the supply last?",
            "As per the feasibility study, which only takes into account the measured and indicated resources, that's 10.7 years. We have another 80 million pounds in an inferred resource. And now it's inferred just through the drill density is at 50 metre spacing, to get it into the measured and indicated, you need to bring that down to 15 to 25 metres. Now that ore will convert as has the balance of the deposit. And then we also have a number of other mineralisation zones in and around Arrow and particularly under Arrow where we've hit more mineralisation but yet to define it because it's under Arrow and it's deep. We have permitted for an initial 24-year mine life. And that permit timeline reflects our confidence in the deposit just in and around Arrow. We discovered it with the first drill hole within a four and a half kilometre radius. We obviously knew what we were doing, no doubt about that. But did we find the only motherlode in the area? I don't think so. We know we have more mineralisation as well. And so we've just recently kicked off our 2024 exploration programme, where we are looking for new Arrow-type zones within an economic distance of the Arrow deposit. So all of that signifies our approach to getting a 24-year initial mine licence.",
            "We did experience as a company the demand for our ore going forward, the interest from utilities in the US, Europe, Japan, other parts of Asia increased substantially with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So I think from an ESG perspective, we're becoming even more preferable with respect to a safe, reliable and socially acceptable source of supply, given the environmental benignness of our mine, but also the location as well.",
            "How much of your proposed production have you already got customers for?",
            "We're currently fully levered to future prices, we have not locked in any pounds of production yet. Once we have visibility on the precise timing of production with the federal approval, we will then start entering into those contracts. But with utilities in the US, Europe, Asia, the Middle East as well ... we've been in dialogue for primarily the last three years and the frequency of those discussions have elevated even in the last three months.",
            "What about the wider outlook for the nuclear sector?",
            "Having been in the sector since 2002 I'm just really pleased that the European Union came out and officially designated nuclear as clean, green and safe relative to any baseload, carbon-emitting form of energy. You saw the UK government really invest heavily in the development of their nuclear programme, the US government have also done it with the Inflation Reduction Act. I think it just reflects that people who are sensible about energy policy have recognised that the merits of nuclear are now based on the scientific fact as opposed to some of the false political ideologies that have been generated around nuclear energy.",
            "What about the picture in Australia?",
            "Having lived in Australia, I think Australia is one of the toughest opinion markets in the world around nuclear energy. We're going to take delivery of nuclear-powered submarines through AUKUS, and I think you are going to see a small modular reactor developed in Australia probably in that 2030 decade, because the realisation around sensible energy policy, if you want carbon-free based low power, it has to be nuclear energy. The last public opinion poll I reviewed had more than half of the population supporting nuclear energy to be developed in Australia ... I think that reflects the scientific appreciation of nuclear as opposed to some of those false ideologies that were generated in the 1960s and 1970s.",
            "What is the latest NexGen Energy news?",
            "During the podcast interview, Curyer said exploration teams were working hard, and said there would be updates in the months ahead. And since the episode was published, NexGen Energy",
            "the discovery of new intense uranium mineralisation on its SW2 Property, 3.5 kilometres east of the Arrow Deposit. In a news release Curyer said \"this new intercept reflects the high potential of NexGen's extensive land package in the south-western section of the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, and is a testament to the strategic and disciplined approach to identifying new Arrow-type zones of mineralisation. Drilling activity is being fully dedicated to this new discovery area to advance our understanding of scope and scale of mineralisation\".",

This was the message of the country’s delegation to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s 60th General Conference being held this week in Vienna. The delegation included specialists in nuclear education, research, design, fuel, policy, law and finance.",
            "Greg Hands, minister of state for international trade in the British government, said in a statement for World Nuclear News: “The UK has one of the most dynamic nuclear markets in the world, with significant new build and waste and decommissioning programmes.  We are open for investment, as emphasised by our recent decision on the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, and are extremely well placed to continue taking on work internationally across the nuclear life cycle.”",
            "The UK delegation is being led by Robin Grimes, who is both chief scientific adviser to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and professor of materials physics at Imperial College.",
            "Grimes told WNN: “We have a long, 60-year history in nuclear and experience of all facets of the nuclear technologies. We are also one of the first nations to enter into the decommissioning process and because we had such a large reactor build early on, we are perhaps a little further along in that process. So we’re useful people to talk to. We are also very clear in our commitments to safety security and safeguards and that is helpful for sharing best practice.”",
            "In his statement to the IAEA General Conference on 28 September, Grimes included the scientific importance of research to the UK’s endeavours in nuclear. Grimes, who runs the Nuclear Academics Network - which is supported by the Research Councils UK Energy Programme - stressed the importance of continued collaboration with his European peers.",
            "“The UK's National Nuclear Laboratory is at the forefront of our nuclear programmes, providing strategic technical advice to government and working with Britain's nuclear sector to drive innovative technologies for the clean-up and decommissioning of the UK's nuclear legacy, perform vital post-irradiation examination to enable safe reactor operations, and undertake research with academics who are addressing advanced nuclear technologies.",
            "“The UK Atomic Energy Authority, a world leader in fusion research and development at its Culham site, operates the Joint European Torus (JET) for collective European experiments, contributing to ITER in many specialist areas, and undertaking the UK’s fusion science and technology research centred on the MAST Upgrade tokamak. Deploying expertise developed for JET, the Authority also contributes to fission and other markets with facilities and R&D for irradiated materials, remote handling and tritium. Our national laboratories are also supported by a strong university based nuclear academic community.",
            "“We also have the UK Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) who have built up considerable decommissioning expertise and skills as a result of our nuclear legacy and who demonstrate unique solutions to tackling the high hazards at the Sellafield site. The NDA works collaboratively with a number of international counterparts and remains committed to sharing our expertise and advice in this area.”",
            "The outcome of the EU Referendum has, however, created uncertainty - both in terms of opportunities for students and the work of UK academics on European nuclear research projects funded by Horizon 2020. This is the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme ever with nearly €80 billion of funding available between 2014 and 2020.",
            "John Roberts, nuclear fellow at The University of Manchester, told WNN: “The government has promised it will pay the funding up until the end of current projects, but nuclear is an international collaborative effort. We don’t know what the impact of the UK leaving the European Union on that collaboration will be.”",
            "Roberts is involved with a project that increases the mobility of nuclear students and lecturers throughout Europe - the European Nuclear Education Network. This allows students to earn credits in a nuclear discipline outside of their host country to gain the extra qualification of the European Master of Science in Nuclear Engineering.",
            "EU funding for nuclear-related subjects in UK universities is spread across education and research projects which develops partnerships with many EU universities and organisations, Roberts said. “Participation in these projects promotes our visibility within Europe and this continuity ensures we can be influential in determining nuclear research and education priorities.”",
            "For example, The University of Manchester helped outline the mission of the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNETP), which was launched in 2007, and Roberts has been chairing SNETP’s Education, Training and Knowledge Management committee for the last two years. “We’ve been involved since the start and therefore have a voice across major European policy for nuclear education,” he said.",
            "Roberts also works closely with the IAEA, which recently established the International Nuclear Management Academy. This promotes nuclear technology management education, a nuclear skill set that was “recognised to be in decline worldwide”, he said.",

            "“The consortium has been going since 2005 and the universities involved have developed other nuclear courses and recruited more nuclear-specific staff to meet demand for extra graduates. The NTEC courses are taught in a short-modular format and so are useful for both part-time students over three years or full-time study in one year, like a traditional Master’s,” he said.",
            "The British university sector would like to see the UK “back at the forefront” of nuclear technologies, he said.",
            "“At the recent UK Nuclear Academics Discussion Meeting, we discussed our current nuclear energy situation as like being first in the queue waiting for the shop to open, whereas we should be the shopkeeper waiting to open the shop.",
            "“The Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre aims to stimulate activity in the nuclear supply chain, but to have a massive reactor design and build programme would be fantastic.

            "Reilly told WNN: “Government support, whether through policy, regulation, law or financial support mechanisms, is key to any new build project moving ahead. The UK government’s recognition of nuclear as a low-carbon technology is leading the global market in this area.",
            "“British government policy to support new build nuclear projects is seen as ground-breaking and a number of countries are looking to the UK to learn and to follow its lead. The system of Contracts-for-Difference, together with a government guarantee to protect the debt financiers, is seen as key to developing nuclear and other low-carbon projects.",
            "“In addition, the professional service providers in the UK have been leading the way in supporting new build projects. Legal, financial and advisory professionals have long been seen as world leaders in the project financing of energy and infrastructure projects around the globe. Nuclear is no different with many new build projects looking to the UK for advice.”",

In addition to asking about our AP1000 plant construction projects - the first of which is currently in the hot functional test phase prior to fuel load - they always want to know about the progress of the three nuclear new build projects in the UK,” he said.",
            "Those projects involve EDF Energy/Areva’s European Pressurized Reactor, Hitachi’s Advanced Boiling Water Reactor and Westinghouse’s AP1000 designs.",
            "“The UK provides a tremendous reference market for counties considering nuclear new build and benchmarks can be taken from an efficient operating fleet, independent licensing of new nuclear technologies, electricity market reform to support clean energy projects, development of the supply chain for future construction projects, financing and many more. British companies working on nuclear new build will be well placed to take the experience gained on all phases of the UK projects, from planning to commissioning, and use this to help other nations develop their programmes.”",
            "Claire Harvey, senior commercial and nuclear lawyer at Prospect Law, noted that the UK’s energy policy is to expand its “low-carbon contribution”.",
            "Harvey told WNN: “Nuclear will play a key role in this and there are plans to build up to 16GW(e) of nuclear capacity over the coming years. Plans to develop the Hinkley Point reactor are well-advanced, and others are in development and going through the regulatory process. The UK recognises that such nuclear expansion can’t take place without the issue of the long-term management of its radioactive waste being adequately addressed, and it is actively seeking a solution to this. In addition, it is also looking at the future use of small modular reactor technology through a £250 million ($325 million) research programme sponsored by government.”",
            "She added: “The UK has a breadth of experience covering nuclear new build, and waste management and decommissioning of its older facilities. Underpinning this is a robust nuclear regulatory system based on sound laws and regulation derived from the IAEA’s Safety Fundamentals and Safety Requirements.",
            "“Specialist legal support is available to newcomer countries from experienced nuclear law firms such as Prospect Law, who can work with local law firms to develop nuclear laws and regulations specific for a particular country. And because the UK does not manufacture reactors we are more independent than most when it comes to providing regulatory and legal advice to newcomer countries.”",

            "“In other words, it seems that governments around the world are increasingly approaching the Association,” Komarov said, and international organisations too have shown they are increasingly keen to work with it. He highlighted new cooperation with the World Energy Congress and the UN Economic Commission for Europe.",
            "“Notwithstanding the fact that the larger organisations, of which these are part, have been traditionally reluctant to acknowledge the role of nuclear in addressing the climate and energy challenges, the Harmony programme opens up new opportunities for surging ahead together,” he said.",

We need deep decarbonisation and we need to use all today’s clean energy forms beyond their normal deployment for electricity generation. What happens when you make decarbonisation the goal? [A] UN supported study brings the answer: It is a large role for nuclear power,” Rising said.",

            "podcast, which you can also listen to via the embedded player below or",
            "On the general world situation and nuclear:",
            "\"I’m not sure I've seen as complicated a geopolitical situation as there is now around the world ... we were feeling tailwinds for nuclear even a couple years ago with the race to decarbonise and electrify and the race to net-zero. But then since February this year, with the Russians moving into Ukraine, the whole issue of energy security has really come to the fore, especially in Europe, but around the world.",
            "\"As far as Cameco goes, we went through a very difficult period I would say post-Fukushima, 10 years where there was too much uranium, too much nuclear fuel around. Things were looking not as good for nuclear, but they've really picked up now and and I could probably name you 20 countries that in the past 12 months have done a complete U-turn on nuclear and are now looking at expanding their fleets or bringing on reactors or SMRs perhaps. So it's a real positive story for nuclear and we have a big role to play in the energy security and clean air segments going forward.\"",
            "\"I think we've been very clear with our strategy for almost a decade now. It's a strategy of discipline that we will not produce uranium just to spray it into the spot market, because we saw how that worked. It doesn't work - it doesn't work for anyone. We lost some of our competitors over it, who were producing into a spot market that fell as low as USD17 per pound in 2017. We said we're only going to produce into the contracts we have and so that meant, for us, taking some really tough medicine. Back in 2016, we shut down our Rabbit Lake mine. We shut down Wyoming, Nebraska and then in 2017 we shut down the world’s largest high-grade mine and mill McArthur River/Key Lake because the world didn't need the uranium and no one else seemed to be stepping up, so we did that. We left over 100 million pounds in the ground at USD17 ... We maintained our supply discipline and today we have a better market. It's better, good enough that we can bring our big McArthur River/Key Lake production centre back into production at reduced levels that will match our sales, and so we'll continue with that as our sales grow, we'll bring on more production, but we will remain very, very disciplined from a production and a marketing point of view ... You'll see some production out of McArthur and Key Lake later this quarter. In the fourth quarter.”",
            "On the Cameco-Westinghouse deal",
            "\"We think the timing is really good. As I said, we've seen some real strong tailwinds coming for nuclear. We could see nuclear coming back as a tool in the toolkit for energy security around the world and so first we looked after our own operations. We made sure we were ready to go and we're restarting, as I say, McArthur River/Key Lake. Cigar Lake’s running well. Our Kazakh operations are running well. Our fuel services conversion in Ontario is really doing well, so we started looking for other things in our area. We're not straying outside of nuclear. Westinghouse was out there and we started looking at it with Brookfield, who was the owner and just a different entity of Brookfield - their Clean Energy Transition Fund - wanted to get involved and we said, 'well, that's brilliant'. Seeing nuclear as clean energy, them buying in, staying in, and then us coming along as a strategic partner and it just made perfect sense. So it took us about six months of due diligence and negotiations. And we think we found the right timing, the right partner and the right project. So we're super excited about the future of Westinghouse.”",
            "The news that Westinghouse was a successful bidder in Poland for its nuclear programme \"is just icing on the cake for us\".",
            "So what part of the Westinghouse deal is most exciting for Cameco?",
            "\"I'd say all of it is pretty exciting for us. Obviously the fuel business - our fuel businesses are very complementary. We provide fuel, we have the uranium conversion and then we actually provide the fuel for the CANDU reactor fleet here in Canada - Bruce Power, OPG, NB Power. Westinghouse takes over where we don't go. They’re in the light water reactor world and provide fuel there and then of course all the servicing and engineering and outages that they can work on. So that's all exciting stuff, that's their core business really and it's a very durable business. There is some excitement too with some of these new products that they're offering. Obviously the AP1000s that they're out selling. I think for Westinghouse, the e-Vinci,  a smaller unit ... I know here in Saskatchewan the government has been talking about perhaps buying and building one of the e-Vincis ... as Cameco we're looking at fuel for SMRs and whether we can play in that field, the HALEU field. We have the GLE global laser enrichment play in the US that we're moving along and moving along faster than we have because of the need for enrichment and so just a lot of areas for us to focus on now. We think there's a lot of room for growth in the nuclear business across the board, and Cameco wants to be there for that.\"",
            "What has been the impact of the war in Ukraine?",
            "\"Let me start with the impact on our countries, and here in Saskatchewan where our head office is located, I think 15 or 20% of our population here are of Ukrainian heritage, and so it's a really sad state of affairs. And our hearts go out to the people in Ukraine, including our customers at Energoatom. Petro Kotin, President and CEO of Energoatom, is a good friend of mine. We had dinner with him just before the end of last year at a big conference in Paris and then, this happened, so our hearts go out on that side first of all. What has it done for the nuclear industry? It has certainly caused a bit of a bifurcation now in the nuclear industry. Meaning there's those countries and companies that will continue to work with Russia - there are some - but there are a lot that won't anymore, and I think of all the Eastern European countries that have VVER technology in their countries and have relied heavily on the Russians for fuel and servicing and engineering and the things we talked about who are now looking for alternatives, and so we think Westinghouse will have a good opportunity in that market to pick up some business. And then Cameco - I was over there in the spring in the Czech Republic and meeting with some of those countries and so we think some of those will start looking West for alternative fuel supply and we'll be there to provide that, so it's really had a huge impact on the global nuclear industry and on Cameco’s business.\"",
            "What about the global situation for Cameco?",
            "\"We have customers in China and India - two countries that continue to grow, with China on a very fast path of growth and India, the same thing. And you see things changing - South Korea, a complete change - they were looking at phasing out some of their nuclear, now they've included it in their green taxonomy and plan to increase their nuclear presence. I mean, you can go to the UK, you can go to France and you can go to Japan and you can just see the momentum that nuclear is getting both from a clean energy perspective but from an energy security perspective as well. So we think there's great room for growth. I think the IEA came out last week and said if we have about 400 gigawatts today of nuclear, we need to double that. Double that in the next 20-25 years - and so for us that's not a long period of time. We need to get moving and get moving now and we're seeing it with Poland making their announcement, in the US - we're spending lots of time in the US where the Biden administration is very, very positive on nuclear with the Inflation Reduction Act, which has lots of support for nuclear. Here in Canada, our own government, the Ontario government and OPG building the first SMR are well on their way in Canada, the GE Hitachi model and so lots of excitement. Lots of things to do and lots of opportunities around the world.\"",
            "On technological developments in the nuclear energy sector",
            "\"Especially on the small modular reactor front I would say I think that the Canadian regulator has in front of them probably 11 or 12 different models of SMR right now, all competing to be the first out of the gate to get permitted, licenced and start construction and find a home and we need that because those first-of-a-kinds won't be easy. They never are. We've seen it in the larger reactor world and now in the SMR world we need to start building them - the Nth one will be super economic and then probably faster to build. The first one will be tough, and then we need to get the fuel ready for those. And you know, there's your question on Russia and Ukraine. I think we were all relying on many models, relying on the Russians for the HALEU fuel for the first SMRs. Now that door has been slammed shut. And so we're all looking around, scrambling maybe, but looking around for alternative ways we can get HALEU to fire up those first SMRs. So that's going on, but lots of great things going on even with the large fleet - such as accident tolerant fuel and passive safety systems. There's lots going on in nuclear and it's very exciting and very positive.\"",
            "How does the current positive outlook compare with previous optimistic eras?",
            "\"We've seen ebbs and flows before. I remember the period from about 2000 to March 2011. I mean there were too many new reactors to keep track of them. So many uranium companies. I think there were 400 uranium companies around. We got into a real exuberant period of time, probably over-the-top exuberance on nuclear. Everybody was building all the time and then we had Fukushima, so we need to be careful about that because after that we went into a 10 year period that wasn't so positive. But I think we're back again. The world is taking another look at nuclear and saying 'yes we can do it, we can do it safely and and cover for these large energy needs'. I mean, if we're turning to electricity for electric cars and electric everything, we're going to need massive amounts of electricity. And we're good at nuclear, we're very good. We've got a great track record over probably 60 years now and new technologies coming out. And so I'm very optimistic about this period. We need to do it right. We need to get financing for new build. We need to build them as much on time and on budget as we can. We've suffered from that blight a bit in the past, but if we do it right and we can do it right because we've done it in the past, the first one is difficult, but then after that you saw it in Sweden in the 1970s, you saw it in France, you saw it in the US, Canada. We can do it and so now is our opportunity, so we should take advantage of that.\"",
            "Does Brookfields Renewables’ involvement in Westinghouse deal show taxonomy’s importance?",
            "\"I think countries around the world are really recognising the clean energy benefits of nuclear power now and really grabbing on to it - I think there's 70 countries who have now made a net-zero commitment and you know, I think 80% of the energy in the world is fossil fuel fired so we need the path to get there. So you can't throw anything out of the toolbox and I think a lot of countries, as I mentioned earlier, are looking around and saying, what do we have - wind, yes, solar yes. Intermittent and right now they are five or six or maybe 10% of the world production of electricity. We need massive amounts more, and they're looking at nuclear again and saying ‘yeah, we need to keep that as an option’. And so it's very positive for countries looking to hit their net-zero commitments. We're seeing it. We'll see it at COP27 meetings where nuclear is at the table. I can tell you a few COPS ago, we weren't at the table and now we're front and centre at the table of countries looking to build nuclear. So I think nuclear is going to play a huge role in the climate change race to net-zero and decarbonisation electrification. And we as an industry must be ready.\"",
            "On new forms of investors in the nuclear industry",
            "\"We saw it here in Canada last week where the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which has traditionally not gone anywhere near nuclear, committed just under a CAD1 billion to the first SMR - OPG’s SMR. That's a big move. Our Minister of Natural Resources came out with very strong statements last week at the IAEA ministerial, as did many other countries on nuclear. You're seeing taxonomies change that are including nuclear in the clean energy discussion ... it's a complete change of lexicon, a change of thinking, and very positive for industry and now, as I say, we need to deliver.\"",
            "So what are the big challenges to fulfilling the potential?",
            "\"I think we have the technologies, now we've got to start building again. I think on the SMR front we need to get some of those built and up and running so that we can build the Nth one, not the first one. The order books are out there now. I think everyone’s going to be watching very closely in Canada as OPG and GE Hitachi build that first unit. The ground is broken so they're off to the races on that one. And I know in the US there's numerous other ones, we need to get those going. On the big units that are being built - the Chinese are very good at it, the Russians are very good and have a big order book. We in the West now need to show that we're back in the game and that we can take our share of the market. I think the announcement with Poland and Westinghouse was a huge announcement, it's going to be a big project. And I think there are more to come. And so we need to show the world that we can deliver our projects on time, on budget, that nuclear is going to be a critical part of the clean energy infrastructure going forward, and we on the fuel side have to be there to back it up with the fuel to run these things. And that’s not for a year or five years or even 10 years - for 50 years. When you're building a reactor today, you're worried about uranium in 2060 and 2080 and so that's what we're thinking about now. It's not just the next few years, it's decades.”",

            "Simon Bowen on UK's 24GW plan and SMR contest",
            "The key quotes from the Great British Nuclear (GBN) chairman's",
            "podcast interview covering future nuclear energy capacity in the UK.",
            "The six contenders in the small modular reactor contest (Image: Composite of each firm's visuals)",
            "The interview with GBN chairman Simon Bowen took place shortly after the UK government unveiled a roadmap to achieving 24GW of nuclear capacity by 2050, and as the six shortlisted companies (EDF, GE Hitachi, Holtec, NuScale, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse) await the next stage of the GBN-led selection process for the UK's small modular reactor programme. Here is an edited selection of key quotes:",
            "How significant is the UK government's roadmap for GBN?",
            "I think it's an overwhelmingly positive document, the next stage in the creation of the nuclear programme for the UK. It gives GBN three roles - it talks about GBN running the SMR selection process. It then talks about us taking on broader nuclear delivery, which means that if we do another gigawatt unit it is likely we'll run the selection process and then run the project and also, when advanced modular reactors (AMRs) come to fruition, it is highly likely that we would run that as well. The third role, which is really important, is that we advise government on the development of policy.",
            "What about the Roadmap more generally?",
            "The important thing is the reiteration of the target of up to 24GW with three to seven gigawatts every five years between 2030 and 2044, which I think is very important because it signals the range that we're aiming at. And then the reiteration that we are going to explore another gigawatt reactor after Sizewell, which for me is very, very important, because there is no way that we're going to get to 2050 and 24GW without the whole range and scales of reactors. Some big announcements on HALEU ... it also talks about the importance of regulation and skills and supply chains. Some people may say there's not a huge amount new in there - well there is, and there is the commitment of government to go on and deliver the programme. And it starts to spell out what the heart of that might be. It's a great step forward and a step in the right direction for forming the UK's new nuclear programme, which we will be accountable for delivering alongside our colleagues in Sizewell and Hinkley.",
            "The short-term focus of SMRs on the eight sites declared in the existing national policy statement is an important set of criteria that we are applying, but I think everybody recognises that if you're going to go after 24GW then those sites are simply not going to be enough, because we live on a small island and and we've got to have much more flexibility about the sites that we have access to. We have to allow the market to have access to the sites we are no longer looking at, or, the consultation is suggesting, that we should no longer be looking at the designation of sites, we should be looking at a criteria-based model which allows the developers to identify the sites and the usages they think they need, and then the criteria that they think should be applied, which should give an awful lot more flexibility to the market to deliver market-led projects. The second part is all about how you enable all of that and the whole role of planning, of environmental consenting, smarter regulation and the documentation - there's some really important consultation on those elements because if we don't get those more efficient, we will not be able to deliver on the target of 24GW. So a combination of more sites, simpler processes and more enabling regulation are really, really important.",
            "On prospects of new sites for nuclear in the UK",
            "We are looking at acquiring access to the existing sites for the SMR programme, sites like Oldbury, Wylfa, Heysham, Hartlepool and the others within the existing policy statement. Those are recognised nuclear sites which we can build on at scale - the SMR programme is all about scale and getting as quickly as we can to deliver on energy security and on the journey to net-zero. The views of the wider nuclear population are really important though, because when you look at AMRs, then if you get things like passive safety approved - walk-away safe - on a number of the AMR technologies, the sites that gives you access to is so much broader. And therefore things like the old industrial sites become more readily accessible because they will very likely be in a different regulatory regime, or modified regulatory regime, because the planning zones are going to be so much smaller. So a more flexible approach to allow the private sector to identify these sites where they know they've got the demand that will justify their business case, and a combination of that plus an enhanced regulatory regime, or a modified regulatory regime, for the different types of plants, all of that will start to open up more sites and therefore more output.",
            "Will GBN be involved in the private-sector led initiatives?",
            "When we did the scoping work for GBN, the very clear advice from all of the nuclear systems around the UK, around the world, was that you really do need a government programme, a government-led programme, an underwritten programme to rejuvenate the nuclear industry and get it started again. And that's exactly why GBN has been set up. What that doesn't do for one minute is preclude private developers developing their own projects, and we would want to encourage it. The only reason we haven't done that so far, is just bandwidth. Let's get set up on the journey to energy security and net-zero through the SMR programme, and now we're in a place where we want to really understand when developers tell us that they don't need any support from government, they don't need any money from the government, well tell us more about that, because we really want to understand it. Having market-led projects will absolutely allow the government to fulfill one of its aims, which is to get as much of this off the government balance sheet and out of the public finances as possible. So the sooner we can do that the better and therefore alternative routes to market and market-led projects are one of the major routes through which you'll deliver that. Our level of support would depend on the level of support they suggest - in the short term I think it is highly likely that we would be, as a very minimum, providing a supporting role.",
            "On the current state of the SMR contest",
            "I prefer to refer to it as a selection process because although they might be competing, we're selecting what we need. The first thing to say is that we're delighted that we got six highly credible technologies that have come forward and want to be part of our process, which is great. We are at the final stages now (11 January, 2024) of preparing and getting the approvals for the invitation to submit an initial tender document. This is the next stage where all six companies will engage with our contractual documentation in terms of how we think it should be structured. They'll submit the responses in their initial tender, we will then go through a process to down-select to around about four with the aim to be placing contracts later in the year. That process is ongoing, I think the main thing that we are very focused on is absolutely on pace, because we need to move quickly from an energy security point of view and from an international market point of view, but what I'm not prepared to do from the GBN board perspective, is trade pace for rigour. Because rigour in the procurement process can be very, very important. So we are in continual conversations at a board level to say, ‘right, ok, are we really ready to go, do we really have a good understanding of the documents, how they fit together’ because at a point where that's the case then we'll release them. I'm delighted about where we've got to, we've got a great team of people ... we’ve got the right people around the table in terms of the vendors and we have got a mass of stuff to do this year because once we've got the tenders out, we've then got to start pulling together what the development companies might look like.",
            "The tender is for the technology all the way through to completion of the regulatory process and final design and completion of design, with then the potential to place a contract. We need an entity that is going to develop the site, a development company, and because we're looking at hopefully more than one technology that we'll be developing, we will be highly likely to be having to pull together more than one development company who will characterise the site, apply for the the consent and the environmental permit, and the nuclear site licence, and then manage the construction and move into operation - and the scale of those is probably about the size of a FTSE 100 company, each one. So these are massive undertakings and we've got all of that to do. It is a hugely exciting time, but actually pretty daunting as well at the same time.",
            "How many of the contenders are likely to be selected?",
            "The initial down-select will be from six to around about four, depending on how things go, and then the documentation says between one and four will be awarded a contract. I think the optimum number is somewhere between two and three, but we will be retaining our optionality and there are some important conversations for us to have with government and the Treasury to determine what, in the policy space, they they are prepared to support.",
            "Will each one chosen be tied to a specific site",
            "At the point where we place the contracts, we will have identified and acquired access to the site. And we will match sites to technology and those sites will have the scale to be able to build multiple SMRs of that technology at that site. So the likelihood is it will be one, two or three in the first stage but then being very clear that if these are successful, as we hope they will be, and they can demonstrate that their costs are going to come down with the second, third and fourth units, and we can convince ourselves it's value for money, then we want to just continue building on those sites. As we've learned internationally, that is the right thing to do ... again subject to the final stages approval, our current view is that we will be placing contracts for more than one (reactor) because what we have to demonstrate is that modularisation works and therefore the investment that is required to build the modular factories.",
            "Will Wylfa be available for SMRs?",
            "I think there is a quite a big policy decision for us to make, which has not been yet made, which is, with the announcement that we are going to explore building another gigawatt scale plant after Sizewell, we've got to be clear about whether we are going to look to identify another site for that, or whether that site should be Wylfa. So there is a debate about whether Wylfa is used for SMRs or gigawatt. Therefore that will drive when we look to acquire access to it.",
            "Is Final Investment Decision still targeted for 2029?",
            "Yes, at the latest 2029. If we could do it before that, then, of course we will.",
            "There's an election coming in the UK, will politics derail plans?",
            "I am very confident that the UK political parties are committed to nuclear being a critical part of baseload power, because every nation that has nuclear capabilities worldwide thinks the same. And the COP28 declaration where 20+ countries have said we’ll triple nuclear by 2050 is massively important for us, so from a macro sense, I think we are in great shape. We've never been in better shape for nuclear, cross-party, I don't think that we will skip a beat in intent. Of course, when there is a change of party, then there is bound to be a little bit of a hiatus as the new team get their feet under the desk and determine how they want to apply their fiscal priorities. Therefore I think the risk is more of scale and pace than whether we do or don't have a nuclear programme. If I was asked to bet money on it I would say that we'll continue with the scale and the pace that we've set out so far, because actually there is no alternative.",
            "General global outlook for nuclear",
            "I think it mirrors what I've just said about the UK - that COP28 declaration was a very important moment in the international nuclear industry and it is one industry, you know, this is not a  national industry where you can draw boundaries. Everything we do is international. Now what does that mean? Well, it's a good news/bad news story.The brilliant news is that we will, as an industry, have the opportunity to grow multiple technologies at multiple scales. And all learn from each other. Having moved out of the nuclear industry and come back into it, the thing I love about the industry is everybody wants to learn from everybody else. I've never seen an industry where people have the thirst for learning off each other and are prepared to share. It is almost unique in that sense, so the opportunity to learn and therefore all accelerate and therefore all contribute to combating climate change and net-zero is just hugely compelling and a great opportunity. So on one hand, I'm just very, very proud to be part of that because I think it's got huge potential. The bad side is there's a global demand for capability. And everywhere you look, we all want very similar skills, so although, the nuclear specialist skills are somewhere between 10 and 20% of what we need, the 70/80/90% of the skills we need are skills that can be employed in infrastructure, in carbon capture usage and storage, hydrogen and petrochem. It is a massive market that we're competing with and it’s a global market. So that's the challenge. It is hugely compelling and with massive opportunities, we have really got to get our act together in terms of skills and capability to understand how we're going to deliver on our ambitions globally, and critically, nationally.",
            "What industry can do to help with nuclear's expansion plans",
            "I think the first thing is we've got to act as one industry - unless we share skills and we find mechanisms for sharing skills across the nuclear sector, both in defence and civil and across the boundaries then it's going to be very, very difficult to succeed. I think the other thing is that the private sector, and I can say this because I'm still part of it, we have got as many signals as we need now to invest. We've got to get on with raising the cash to invest in the infrastructure and the skills and the capability that are required. So waiting for a starting gun any longer isn't going to work. That starting gun's been fired. And these announcements are part of that, so, I think we've all just got to trust in the fact that absolutely, this is going to happen, it's got to happen, and we need to be prepared with the right capability and the right capacity ... it's now up to us to deliver.",

This year's competition invites entrants to write a 5000-word essay on 'Why SMR? The unique role that small modular reactor deployment could play in the future challenges of global energy supply'. The winners will be announced at the European Nuclear Young Generation Forum (ENYGF) to be held on 15 June in Manchester.",
            "Spark! Contest president and co-founder Nicholas Morris told",

Morris is a project engineer at Assystem, which is a co-sponsor of this year's competition. Other sponsors are EY (formerly Ernst & Young) and Costain, while the International Youth Nuclear Congress and Franco-British Connections are partners.",
            "\"We had 50 submissions and had to narrow those down to 15 teams of between one and three people, who are students or graduates in Great Britain or in France. During the workshop, the panellists gave the teams critical feedback on the ideas for their essays. They will then have the very tough task of deciding who will be accepted as a laureate and a final prize winner,\" Morris said.",

            "French ambassador to the UK",
            "The theme of SMRs for this year's contest \"worked out perfectly as the right topic at the right time\", Morris said, in view of the British government's launch in March 2016 of the initial phase of its SMR competition.",
            "That launch followed publication by the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL), in December 2014, of a feasibility study into the potential use of SMR technology in the UK. The work considered four designs in detail to inform the technical, financial, market, innovation and commercial assessments that make up the study, namely: ACP100+ (designed by CNNC); mPower (B&W and Bechtel); Westinghouse SMR (Westinghouse); and NuScale (Fluor).",

            "Michel Dubarry, president of Rolls-Royce International, Europe and North Africa, described how the competition had been inspired by the USAIRE student award, created for the aerospace and defence sector 12 years ago. Dubarry also highlighted Rolls-Royce's role in the STEM sector and the fact that two young engineers from the company - Jonathan Hart and Brett Longstaffe - had won the Spark! Contest last year. Hart is a research and technology leader at Rolls-Royce in Manchester, and Longstaffe is a fluid systems engineer with Rolls-Royce in Derby.",
            "The 2016 contest looked at 'the nuclear fuel cycle in 2040', including existing technology and also the so-called Generation IV reactors. The workshop last year was held at the British embassy in Paris.",
            "Jean Llewellyn, chief executive of the UK's National Skills Academy for Nuclear and a Spark! Contest panellist, told",
            ", \"One of the interesting challenges to me is how the contestants can actually make their papers unique and different. Last year they were all on different topics so they were naturally very distinct, but this time because they're all focused on SMRs, it's going to be quite interesting to see what each team comes up with that's a unique approach to take.\" She added: \"It's great to see Spark! is growing, and the fact they're getting the support of the embassies is a very positive factor; it gives the whole event real kudos and profile.\"",
            "Sylvie-Agnès Bermann, the French ambassador to the UK, told the workshop's delegates: \"For both our industries to remain successful we need to work together, create together and innovate together. The Spark! Contest provides another link between us, one that makes our education and industry stronger, reminding us of the importance of [collaboration] in these uncertain times.\"",
            "Robert Fletcher, president of nuclear services and projects at Rolls-Royce, said: \"I don't need to say how important cooperation in energy and especially in nuclear energy is going to be. The relationship between the stakeholders, and particularly between the governments and industries of our two countries, is going to be absolutely key and we need to continue to explore future bilateral relationships. Building such ties is a necessity now more than ever. This cooperative spirit is exactly what the Spark! Contest is there to achieve.\"",
            ": \"Spark! sets the finalists up nicely for the future to think how they develop their career, how they're going to get involved in things. It's giving them great access to people in the industry and also - as a result of Spark! - they will get an opportunity to go and work in different organisations. That's a great opportunity at a young age to be able to get that exposure.\"",

            "Asked about the role of the regulator in inspiring young talent, Kelbie said: \"ONR is well-networked and does a lot to give discretionary coaching and mentoring because we want all of these people to think about safety and security right from the beginning of their career, just as we do with Women in Nuclear and the Nuclear Institute Young Generation Network.\"",

This is based on the International Energy Agency's 2-degree scenario, which aims to avoid the most damaging consequences of climate change and requires a large increase in nuclear energy. Harmony aims at nuclear energy providing 25% of electricity in 2050, requiring roughly 1000 GWe of new nuclear capacity to be constructed.",

            "In January, Rolls-Royce named the companies it is working with to bring an SMR design to market in the UK - Amec Foster Wheeler, Nuvia and Arup - with other names to emerge in due course. Last October, Rolls-Royce said a UK SMR design could provide a £100 billion ($127 billion) boost to the UK economy between 2030 and 2050 because the companies involved are either UK-owned or have a strong UK presence. It anticipates creating up to 40,000 high-value British jobs and intellectual property, and opening up a £400 billion export market.",
            "John Molyneaux, director of engineering and technology for civil nuclear at Rolls-Royce, outlined the SMR sector to the workshop's delegates. \"The challenge here is to think beyond what you see in the normal literature. It's that innovation, that spark that all the finalists can bring that's really important, because when you've been in the industry for 30 years, as I have, you tend to think in a conforming way with the industry around you. So, thinking in an innovative way is critical because we can't move forward without it.\"",
            "SMR is a \"very broad church\", he said, with a number of designs around the world. \"You can't lose track of the fact that anyone developing an SMR, probably wants to dominate their home market and could quite easily be supported by their own government. That means when we talk about the overall international marketplace we need to think about accessibility. There is no chance that any individual nation will have a market sufficient to warrant the development and then deployment of multiple sites to the extent of getting a good return on the investment,\" he said.",
            "Referring to the light water, high-temperature gas-cooled and liquid metal SMR designs, he said: \"At the outset, I would encourage you to think hard about the origins of plant designs in submitting your papers because that often tells the fundamental advantages and drivers which led to the initial part of the design.\" He added: \"And the time to market for the SMR technology is really important.\"",
            "Asked about Rolls-Royce's progress with its SMR consortium, Molyneaux told",
            ": \"You don't see reactors being built without the help and support from government, so we're still really waiting for the [UK] government to draw a conclusion to the expression of interest they set out at the start of last year. If they support our thoughts on the consortium, then we'll be able to make more announcements.\"",
            "Bermann underscored the role of Franco-British collaboration through EDF Energy, which with its partner China General Nuclear is building two Areva-designed European pressurised water reactors (EPRs) at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Rolls-Royce has preferred bidder status for Hinkley Point C contracts.",
            "The ambassador said: \"Although EDF is a French company, EDF Energy is a British one and it operates all the nuclear power plants here. The partnership between France and the UK was strengthened even further with the signature of the Hinkley Point C project in September. This is exactly the kind of project the company wanted to be a leader in the European energy sector.",
            "\"Nuclear energy may be difficult to finance, but it is essential to meet the Paris Agreement targets and decarbonise Europe. This is why we must join forces to make such projects successful so that our industries can stand up to the very competitive global energy market and export our cutting-edge technology.\"",
            "Morris added: \"Both France and the UK have their own strengths, technologically and culturally speaking, as we've seen with the Hinkley Point C project. Britain hasn't built a reactor in close to 30 years and therefore we have France to help bring their knowledge of the continuing use, construction and design of nuclear reactors in the last years, particularly with regards to Flamanville, to bring that through into the UK as part of a French design context. But, similarly, the ONR and British nuclear history and expertise are also something that's invaluable and it's a benchmark that feeds back through to France.\"",
            "The EPR being built as unit 3 of the Flamanville nuclear power plant in Normandy is scheduled to start up at the end of next year.",
            "Manus O'Donnell, head of technical at EDF Energy Generation, said the company is \"interested in the opportunity around being the potential future owner and operator of future nuclear technologies, of which SMRs could be part\".",
            "Asked how the choice between SMR designs should be made, O'Donnell told",
            ": \"We can't do it alone. We've got to do it in collaboration with regulators, with governments, both here in the UK and elsewhere. It's about making decisions about what it is you want to get out of the opportunity. So, if it's speed to market, that helps with your decision-making on what technology to zone in on, and once you've done that you can align and drive forward. Equally, if it's more of the future innovative skills development approach that you want, then you will be interested in a different technology set. So, it's about understanding the different technologies and we're in a good position to be able to do that and to help advise people on what it is they want to get out of an SMR future adventure.\"",
            "The company operates the UK's seven advanced gas reactors (AGRs), which are scheduled to close between 2023 and 2030, and one pressurised water reactor, which will close in 2035.",
            "O'Donnell said EDF Energy is \"exploring the opportunity for making the best value\" of its existing nuclear power plant sites. \"I wouldn't definitively say whether it is or isn't going to be an SMR, but they are nuclear friendly areas, so looking at future nuclear technologies and the potential for deployment of them is absolutely something that we'd be interested in.",
            "\"As an owner and operator, we have a real opportunity to help the developers of technology to suite spot and work collaboratively with both the UK and potentially French regulatory systems, or even the US regulatory system, because we understand the kind of technologies and how to deploy them and work properly with the regulator. It's important to see a strong regulator and we can work carefully with some of the developers to help with international licensing,\" he said.",
            "On attracting new personnel, he said: \"There's healthy interest in people wanting to work with EDF Energy and there is a need to focus on future skills development. So, it's a range of things, from an apprenticeship type of approach balanced with the high-end skills needs, in order to get the right mix of people needed for operating the reactors of today and the reactors of tomorrow.\"",

            "in Paris with a VIP pass. Here I was thrilled to learn that Brett and I had won. We were presented our award by Jean-Bernard Lévy, CEO of EDF. In addition to the great experience up to that point, our prize was the opportunity to complete shadowing with a number of senior members of the nuclear industry. Personally, I have spent time at the ONR, EY, NNL and am in the process of organising opportunities at Rolls-Royce and EDF Energy. This has been a great experience, offering really varied learning and contacts.\"",
            "The main piece of advice he would give this year's finalists is \"to make the most of the process, instead of purely focusing on the final prize\".

The first is a forecast for the near-term global deployment of SMRs and the third is a look at the long-term benefits of an established SMR market complementary to current large-scale nuclear power. The second is what we think makes our paper unique and is an examination of what changes are required in terms of the safety, regulatory and financial environments to make that future a reality and how SMRs represent a fantastic opportunity to address these areas.",

I've been involved with developing advanced manufacturing techniques and building process modelling capability within the business. It's a project with a lot of high-level visibility and I've been given a huge amount of responsibility with driving it forward.

            "Nuclear Energy and its Future",
            "conference on 11 January said. These challenges include: the notion nuclear is an out-dated technology; the cost of finance; market design; political changes; perceived competition with renewable energy; and the public's misconceptions about radioactive waste.",
            "\"Whether you look at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and their famous 1.5 degree report, or you look at the International Energy Agency and their scenarios, if you want to have a prayer to get anywhere close to the Paris climate targets of constraining the temperature rise to 2 degrees Centigrade over pre-industrial levels, then you need probably to at least double the contribution of nuclear,\" said Dan Poneman, president and CEO of Centrus Energy Corp.",
            "\"And if you think, as in the IPCC report, that 2 degrees is not enough, and if you want to get to 1.5 degrees, then the case [for nuclear] is that much stronger. And, to be clear, that assumes absolutely maximum deployment of solar and wind and battery storage. You just don’t close the gap without a lot of new nuclear.\"",
            "The idea that nuclear energy is on the way out is erroneous, said Sama Bilbao y León, director general of World Nuclear Association.",
            "Nuclear power is the second largest source of low-carbon electricity in the world and the first among OECD countries. At the end of 2020, there were 441 operable reactors in 31 nations, more than 50 new reactors under construction (including seven new construction starts), and five new units came online in Belarus, China, Russia and the UAE. Notably, Belarus, Turkey and the UAE are newcomers to nuclear energy. About 600 MWe of nuclear capacity will be added this year and, in the US alone, almost 200 MWe of nuclear capacity has been added to the grid because of uprates, meaning improvements to the way existing nuclear plants operate. The 15 new reactors that are coming online this year include new technologies - a fast neutron reactor and a small modular reactor, both in China.",
            "\"There are a few countries, including Germany, Belgium and Spain, that are contemplating the permanent shutdown of their existing fleet but on the other hand we have a very large number of countries, not only in Europe but all over the world, that are actually trying to expand [nuclear], for example, eastern European countries, and some of them for the first time, such as Poland. Also, the UK, France, Finland and the Netherlands are putting a strong focus on continuing nuclear,\" Bilbao y León said.",
            "Jay Wileman, president and CEO of GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, said the future of nuclear really depends on \"building on today's nuclear\", the operating fleets that are generating 11% of the world's electricity, and nearly 20% of all the electricity and almost 60% of the clean energy in the USA.",
            "\"By keeping them operating and working with our customers is really critical. We learned a lot last year from COVID. My business was thinking about how our factory workers do the PPE [personal protective equipment] checks, as other businesses are doing, but also about enabling our engineers to collaborate whilst working from their offices, their dining rooms, wherever, and keeping them safe. The third area I think about is supporting our customers with outages; how do we work with them to have their protocols in place and be safe for our teams as they're engaging in a 2-3 week outage. It's a new way of working that we're getting used to and we just have to figure out how to keep supporting our customers so they can keep that 24/7 reliable carbon-free nuclear plant running.\"",
            "GE Hitachi is also part of the new wave of small modular reactors, with its BWRX-300 design. Asked whether such technologies are going to replace large-scale nuclear plants, Wileman said: \"If you're going to be net zero, nuclear is going to have a place, but you're not guaranteed a seat at the table unless you can be cost competitive with other forms of generation. It's great to be small and modular, but you still have to compete with those others as well, so I think about it with my team as a series of 'What ifs?'",
            "\"These are: What if you could have an SMR that is cost competitive with combined cycle gas, solar and wind? What if the total cost of that plant isn't double-digit billions like some of the large builds are, but is actually a billion or under? What if you can simplify a reactor to get the cost down? What if you can use the existing supply chain? What if you can have SMRs address other things, like process heat, hydrogen generation, district heating, that really increase the value of that asset? What if you can get that out to the grid by 2028?\"",
            "Poneman said there are Generation III and Generation III+ units under construction, including the Vogtle plant in the USA, but noted the attention SMRs are attracting.",
            "\"There are both conventional lightwater reactors of the small variety, like GE's design, and there are also fourth generation reactors that don’t use water coolants; they use gas, liquid metal or sodium, etc. All of these have a tremendous amount of excitement and in the United States the government is investing heavily and is now watching what's called the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, in which they have already funded two of these advanced designs for a 50-50 cost share to be deployed and have given a number of additional grants to other reactors to be developed,\" he said.",
            "\"We need to do two things - get the costs down and have regulatory reform. But we have to get smarter, better, faster, cheaper manufacturing methods, artificial intelligence designs etc. The other thing is we have to restore public confidence in places like Germany, Belgium and Japan where you still have aftershocks, politically speaking, with respect to Fukushima. I think the way to regain public confidence is to show that we have faster, better, cheaper designs that can bring tremendous amounts of clean energy, and without which we are going to face continued rising sea levels and lost polar ice caps and devastated coral reefs etc.",
            "\"It would be remiss if I did not say one thing more, which is all of these great designs won’t do very much if we don’t have fuel for them and so we in our company are focused very much on developing this new form of highly concentrated fuel from high-assay, low-enriched uranium. A problem that the vast number of developers in the United States have said keeps them awake at night is access to this new type of fuel. So if we can get all of these things working, then it's very promising for all of us and for the planet.\"",
            "Bilbao y León said that approaches to regulation need to be harmonised and markets need to reflect the true value of nuclear energy as low-carbon baseload power.",
            "\"There is a need for a level playing field in all aspects, including at the policy and the market levels. We need a new paradigm that really focuses on genuine public wellbeing, our health, the environmental impacts and the socio-economic impacts of all energy sources, and truly looks at them in the same context to make a fair comparison. When that is done, it will be much easier to see how nuclear can positively contribute to the economy and the decarbonistion of electricity systems,\" she said.",
            "\"Current energy markets fail to recognise the full cost and the full benefits of all the sources of electricity generation. Even if we have carbon pricing, it doesn't really include all climate change costs or pollution costs. No system [currently] takes into account the value of system costs, or the value of the reliability or 24/7 operation, such as are provided by nuclear energy. Another thing that will have a huge impact when developing new nuclear is having access to financing that is also equitable with other low-carbon electricity sources.",
            "\"Another necessary aspect is the harmonisation of regulatory processes. There is a need for more international consistency, efficiency and predictability in the way that new reactors are licensed.\"",
            "George Borovas, head of nuclear at Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, said the approaches to financing clean energy projects are growing.",
            "\"Over the past few years we've seen solutions coming up around the world. A lot of countries are looking at new nuclear, finding financial solutions and employing different models, from using export credit agencies as well as sovereign finance models, so there is a better understanding of the risks that go along with the construction of new nuclear,\" he said.",
            "\"We have different technologies now. The Gen III reactors that were designed and built over the past 20 years are now operating. And something the nuclear industry has shown is that, once you have a nuclear reactor, the costs go down, the standardisation increases, and so you can replicate what you've done before and with success. Now we also have small modular reactors that are slowly being developed and which are promising to be cheaper, safer, better, and that's going to provide more discreet financial solutions for [units] that are going to be built in series.",
            "\"In general over the past few years, I've seen tremendous excitement return to the nuclear industry, and it reminds me of the technological revolution that we saw in the 1980s in other technologies. Nuclear is going to play a vital role in the development of safe and reliable power for the future of the world.\"",
            "The falling cost of solar and wind power is often interpreted as a threat to nuclear, which is a false connection, the panellists said.",
            "\"This is not an either/or. We have a huge challenge ahead of us and if we want to achieve decarbonisation and at the same time the Sustainable Development Goals, we are going to need everything. There is also the typical understanding that nuclear has always been expensive, or the economics of nuclear are not as good as they need to be,\" Bilbao y León said.",
            "She noted that a joint report by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Energy Agency, published in December, states that the lowest cost energy sources of all types is the lifetime extension of nuclear plants. \"The cheapest way, hands-down, to ensure low-carbon generation for the next 20 years is lifetime extension of the current nuclear power plants,\" she said.",
            "Another conclusion of the report was that new nuclear projects for the next five years are actually competitive with all other forms of electricity generation, including wind and solar.",
            "\"What we are seeing is that the nuclear industry has actually achieved a lot of learning from recent projects that have not been as on budget and schedule as we would have liked them to be, but the expectation is that future projects are going to become much more competitive,\" Bilbao y León said.",
            "She stressed that 70% of the levelised cost of nuclear is the cost of finance. \"This means that if nuclear can have access to competitive financial resources comparable with those that other energy sources do, then the cost will come down even more. That's why it's important to have a level playing field that looks at all energy sources in the same way, and that establishes criteria that are technology neutral and that are based on the actual accomplishments of the technology,\" she said. \"I truly think that new nuclear projects are going to become much more competitive than they are. Small modular reactors are going to make nuclear much more affordable and that means nuclear will expand to markets which perhaps haven't considered having nuclear before.\"",
            "Poneman said renewables need to be understood not only in terms of their benefits but also their limitations.",
            "\"On the connection between renewables and nuclear, we need all of it, but if you want to max out intermittent sources, then you need to back it up. The battery technology is not cheap enough or widespread enough at grid-scale to be able to do that job. So, if you want to maximise solar, you need dispatchable power that's either coal, gas or nuclear, and obviously nuclear is the carbon-free version of that,\" he said.",
            "Taming the Sun, Innovations to Harness Solar Energy and Power the Planet",
            ", by Varun Sivaram, Poneman said, \"It's faster, better, cheaper to do that if you have the backup of dispatchable power, of which nuclear is a good case in point.\"",
            "He noted the Natrium concept launched by GE Hitachi and Bill Gates' TerraPower, which features a sodium fast reactor combined with a molten salt energy storage system that will allow over five hours of energy storage.",
            "\"They use the heat all the time generated by the nuclear reaction to heat molten salt, so that molten salt can serve the same way as a battery to backstop the additional use of solar power. So, the either/or proposition between nuclear and solar and wind is a false dichotomy and it's destructive to our overall energy and climate goals,\" Poneman said.",
            "Borovas said nuclear is the natural clean energy partner for renewables.",
            "\"Nuclear and renewables complement each other because nuclear is the baseload energy that helps you run your industry and makes sure that the lights are on at all times, and then, with renewables, you can have a combination of low-carbon sources. What we've seen happen in some countries is that renewables have been displacing nuclear, which doesn’t make sense,\" he said.",
            "\"Having renewables backed up with gas-fired plants or sometimes even coal-fired plants doesn’t make sense if climate change is your number one priority, and I think there is universal consensus that that is our number one priority. Having nuclear and renewables together working at full capacity is the only solution that we have for climate change today.\"",
            "Bilbao y León also addressed the false claim that nuclear units are inflexible.",
            "\"Although it is true that nuclear reactors don’t like to be turned on and off, they are much more flexible than is commonly known. We have many countries, including France, Germany and the US, where nuclear reactors actually do follow the load,\" she said.",
            "\"Moving forward towards Generation IV reactors, their flexibility and ability to load follow are going to be even more possible. And don’t forget that nuclear energy is the only low-carbon energy source that can produce electricity and heat at the same time, which will be very important to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors, such as transportation and industry.\"",
            "Asked how political changes, such as the new US administration, are affecting the nuclear industry, Borovas said: \"In the United States over the past few years we've seen an increased competitiveness in attention to the US nuclear industry and its exports. What we've seen from the new Biden administration is there's going to be a continuation of that policy.\"",
            "There is consensus among lawmakers in the USA that nuclear energy is a geopolitical matter and that there is competition from Russia and China. This means there is an understanding that the US nuclear industry and its exports are going to be vital for that country's national security and commercial interests, he said.",
            "\"You can't be an exporter of technology without first taking care of your domestic industry, so the United States needs to keep its existing fleet, start building new nuclear power plants and then the world market will listen and say it's going to buy its product. If you say, 'We're not going to be building it back home because we have cheap gas, but buy my product because it's a great one', then that's not going to be very convincing. Slowly the United States is beginning to understand that,\" he said.",
            "Wileman said he had felt \"very encouraged\" over the last few years by the bipartisan and bicameral support in the USA for the nuclear industry.",
            "\"You see the number of bills that have come out, including the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, because of which the Natrium project was able to move forward. That's a great way to accelerate technology coming to market,\" he said. \"I think we do have the incoming administration's support; it's in their platform, and obviously climate is key. In the US, we're going to continue to seek momentum. It will be all about getting online, getting traction and getting those reactors under way.\"",
            "Poneman picked up on Borovas' comment that a nuclear industry \"needs to be strong at home to be strong internationally\".",
            "He said: \"Let's not forget non-proliferation because the United States was at the cornerstone with President Eisenhower and ever since in setting up a whole global network of non-proliferation controls and restrictions that have made nuclear power safe, not only in terms of physical safety, but in terms of national security safety. So, the United States has to get out there. Obviously China and Russia have been very aggressive in promoting nuclear exports, and if the United States wants to continue to be a global leader, in terms of both safety standards and non-proliferation standards, then this commitment is present in the new administration. It was in the climate plan published by then candidate and vice-president, and now president-elect, Biden, who has advocated for advanced nuclear.\"",
            "This represents a great opportunity for the USA \"to get our groove back\", he said. \"The fact that we have strong bicameral support - both the House and the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, the Congress and the White House - is a very auspicious circumstance for the future.\"",
            "The long-term management of used nuclear fuel and nuclear waste is an issue often raised by sceptics of nuclear energy but, the fact is, the nuclear industry \"has done a fabulous job throughout its entire history\", to the point that it is well know where this material is, and how it is being managed, isolated and separated from the environment and from humans, Bilbao y León said. Notably there has been work on deep geological disposal and on recycling fuel in reactors.",
            "\"Obviously the choice of policies for managing used fuel and nuclear waste rests with individual countries but the technologies for this do exist,\" she said. \"In Finland, a deep geological repository is under construction and will start operations in a couple of years, and so we will have a functioning example of how this can be done. The long-term management of used fuel and nuclear waste is one of those issues that is important for the energy community to look at the entire picture, and in fact we will see how nuclear waste is really not a big problem and is being well-managed by the industry.\"",
            "Wileman added: \"Always, when I'm on a panel, I hear the term nuclear 'waste' and I'm glad Sama corrected it; she said 'used' nuclear fuel. I would go a little further and call it 'slightly used' nuclear fuel because, of the typical fuel that we have today, we've only extracted a few percent of its potential energy. So, I have always been a proponent of closing the fuel cycle and really getting all the energy out of there. The Gen IV fast reactors are well-suited for that, so as we move through the different generations of design, I think we'll have the opportunity to elegantly address that topic.\"",
            "Poneman said the management of nuclear waste is \"a much bigger political problem than it is a physical problem\".",
            "\"All of the nuclear waste generated in the United States of America since the beginning of the nuclear era would fill one football field seven yards deep. Closing the fuel cycle is one way, but we know for a fact the scientifically geologic storage formations that work. What we need is to have the same as they have in Finland, which is a consent-based process, so that the public will have confidence in the solution that is found. With the options we've described - both geologic long-term disposal and recycling - the solutions are well in-hand,\" he said.",
            "Asked what they would say to those who oppose nuclear energy, regardless of the facts, Wileman said: \"If you care about the environment and if you have questions, learn, go and be inquisitive, find the truth rather than what's in a headline. Look at what nuclear energy has been doing and what it can do in the future. Educating, which the World Nuclear Association works on, and the Nuclear Energy Institute in the US, is a key part that we have to keep in mind as we go forward and bring people on board supporting nuclear.\"",
            "Poneman added: \"By 2050, if we don't max out on getting to net zero, we will lose 99% of the world's coral reefs, all of the polar ice caps, and God knows what's going to happen to the coastal areas of most of the world, and you will have devastation of a catastrophic planetary dimension. Nuclear power is safe. In terms of deaths per watt generated, it is among the safest in the world. If you care about saving the planet, let's get nuclear right; let's not throw it out the window.\"",
            "Bilbao y León repeated that the choice to use nuclear energy must remain a decision for every individual country, but it would be \"irresponsible\" to deprive future generations of that choice. \"We can't close the door to this technology just because we have the opinions we have right now.\"",
            "Borovas said: \"The key to sustainable development is energy and electricity. As we try to get people all over the world out of poverty and into the middle class, then having abundant and clean electricity that does not affect the environment is key. Nuclear has to be part of that.\"",

            "Large infrastructure projects require a range of key features and sufficient risk management to attract financing, but a new nuclear project has to go further still to draw in potential backers, delegates at a recent conference in London heard.",
            "New nuclear programs similarly need to align with associated infrastructure, such as grid and transport networks, as well as develop a supply chain, receive planning consents and engage with national and local government, along with the businesses, education establishments and communities in the area the project is based. They also need to have their reactor design scrutinised by national regulators, a process that in the UK can take as long as five years. In addition, the project needs to have a fuel supply, operations, maintenance and decommissioning strategy, looking as much as 80 years ahead.",
            "Representatives of the three planned UK projects - led by EDF Energy, Horizon Nuclear Power and NuGeneration - told Marketforce's",
            "on 20 April that, although they are each taking a different approach to finance, they all have the same focus - to demonstrate their plans are \"investible\". Other infrastructure experts, from AECOM, National Grid and Crossrail, offered additional insight.",
            "From left to right, Evans, Devlin, Knee and Brister at the Marketforce event (Image: WNN)",
            "The three projects are not competing to justify the benefits they bring to the UK electricity sector - since the start of the decade 26 of the country's power stations have closed and together they accounted for around 20% of its electricity generation capacity. By the end of 2030, a further 35% of that capacity is likely to have gone. The need therefore for new and reliable low-carbon power is even more important than ever here in the UK, delegates at the conference heard. Where the new build consortia",
            "competing, potentially, is for additional investors to carry their respective projects beyond a final investment decision (FID).",
            "\"It takes millions to establish one of these programs and billions to deliver them,\" said Jay Brister, vice president of business development at AECOM, a US-based construction, engineering and professional services firm. \"Delivery of a new nuclear project involves a complex set of high risk, high impact activities over ten to 15 years with huge financial implications. Risk and risk mitigation is a key component of financing, whether it's political, geographical or completion risk. Coming up with the right financing structure is one of the biggest challenges that you face in one of these programs.\"",
            "Brister added that implementing a successful nuclear power program requires the positive support of international and bilateral agreements; a stable, independent and reliable nuclear regulator; technical skills and infrastructure development; a proven delivery program and partners; positive electricity market regulation; a decommissioning strategy; as well as fuel cycle and back end management. Above all, the role of government is the key to success, he said.",
            "EDF Energy has state backing for its Hinkley Point C (HPC) project in Somerset - the majority owner of its parent company, EDF Group, is the French government, and its Chinese partner is state-owned.",
            "Consisting of two European Pressurised Reactors (EPRs), HPC will be the first new nuclear power station to be built in the UK in almost 20 years and will provide about 7% of the country's electricity.",
            "Under a deal agreed last October, China General Nuclear (CGN) will take a 33.5% stake in EDF Energy's £18 billion ($28 billion) project to construct HPC. In addition, the two companies will develop projects to build new plants at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex, the latter using Chinese reactor technology. EDF's share in the project stands at 66.5%, but the company said it intends to offer other investors stakes in the project whilst retaining at least a 50% share itself.",
            "Humphrey Cadoux-Hudson, managing director of nuclear new build at EDF Energy, told delegates: \"We now have the right framework in place, developed and delivered under a sequence of governments to make this investment possible. That's why EDF Group and our Chinese partner CGN, together with the UK and French governments, are absolutely committed to this project going ahead.\"",
            "Since 2012 EDF Energy has received its nuclear site licence and generic design assessment (GDA) for the UK EPR design, as well as planning permission from the Secretary of State, following a year-long examination by the Planning Inspectorate. In 2013, it reached agreement with the UK government on the key terms of the proposed contract-for-difference (CfD) and with Infrastructure UK it guaranteed the project debt. A year later, following examination by the European Commission, it received state aid approval for these agreements, which include the price, contract length, inflation indexation and fiscal risk protection.",
            "EDF Energy has so far spent £2.4 billion on the project, but has yet to make a FID, which had been expected by the end of last year. The group's chairman and CEO, Jean-Bernard Lévy, said in March that EDF is negotiating with the French government to obtain further financial support for HPC.",
            "Cadoux-Hudson told the conference: \"Investment of this scale - £18 billion through construction to operation of Hinkley Point C - clearly needs to be made with careful thought.\" Difficult wholesale power market conditions, plus the wide range of investments that EDF is looking to make to deliver low-carbon power for its customers, mean a FID on Hinkley requires time, he said. But the company is confident, he said, that a FID will be taken soon and that plans for commissioning of the first reactor in 2025 will go ahead.",
            "Referring to schedule and cost overruns of the EPRs under construction at Olkiluoto and Flamanville, Cadoux-Hudson said, \"The challenges of the EPR design in Finland and France relate to the need to put in place the highest standards of project management, to integrate the supply chain into the design process and to ensure that we will only start in earnest when we are sure that we won't have to stop. It's an easy thing to say but requires an enormous amount of planning.\"",
            "EDF is \"seeing great progress\" at the two EPRs under construction by CGN in Taishan in China, where testing is already under way on the primary circuit, with the first unit expected to be in operation next year. \"The experience of construction in Taishan has helped us to prepare even better for construction at Hinkley,\" he said. \"Above all the need for an integrated robust schedule and cost estimates and a stable design from the start are essential.\"",
            "EDF Energy has spent more than 4.7 million hours on engineering to finalise the reference design for the UK EPR, and it is working through construction via 4-D digital models of the plant covering the site layout, through the arrangements of the internals of the building, down to the detail of individual reinforcement bars, he said. Major preparation work on the site itself has been completed.",
            "Nigel Knee, EDF Energy's head of nuclear policy, said that HPC is \"already an investible project\". He told",
            ": \"How have we got there? It's about having political support, regulatory and political stability. Then, when you look at the individual parts of the project, it's about being able to present to potential investors and to say that you have correctly identified the risks and allocated them to the parties that are best able to take them. We're prepared to take on the construction risk. For revenue risk we needed some support from the government in order to secure the contract-for-difference to provide a measure of revenue certainty over a 35-year period. Then you put together the business case which leads to a competition in the world market for capital. You need to be able to demonstrate that investing in the project will bring a competitive rate of return.\" The CfD for the Hinkley project \"is not a guaranteed income stream\", he stressed. “We still need to sell all the power in the market. We may well be paying back if fossil fuel prices are very low.\"",
            "Tried and tested technology",
            "Carl Devlin, program director at Horizon Nuclear Power, said bringing a technology that is tried and tested is a \"fundamental part of our proposition\". The advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR) has been built and operated four times in Japan, he said, and \"sitting behind that is a long legacy of nuclear power projects inside Hitachi\". Horizon is \"working to ensure the transfer of expertise from Japan into the UK to support our schedule as well as delivering it on cost,\" he said.",
            "Established in 2009 and acquired by Hitachi in November 2012, Horizon aims to provide at least 5.4 GWe of new capacity across two sites by deploying Hitachi-GE UK ABWRs. It expects the first unit at Wylfa to be operating in the first half of the 2020s. The project represents a £20 billion investment in the UK energy sector.",
            "The project is to be carried out as a single engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract joint venture. \"We will be bringing on a management partner and a project delivery partner,\" Devlin said. \"Our number one priority is to make this an investible project.\"",
            "Devlin, who joined Horizon last year, has worked on industrial projects in other sectors, including Heathrow's Terminal 5 and the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. For such large-scale projects to be a successful investment, he said, \"you have to make sure all the components are clear and ready before you start. Changes are expensive and that's when you get into cost overruns.\"",
            "He added: \"It's crucial that we create and develop a project that is investible and get the commercial and financial arrangements right to ensure it attracts the additional investment that will be required. We look forward to making real and demonstrable progress in our discussions with Her Majesty's Government so that we can complete on track with the current schedule.\" The project will require a CfD, a \"Treasury guarantee\", future power sales and additional investors, he said.",
            "Completing the GDA process and obtaining all the planning and environmental consents and permits that are required are \"fundamental enablers for giving confidence to investors that we are able to achieve the project\", he said. Horizon is working towards making its site licence application and it has a number of work streams on site, he added. The company expects to have all consents and permits required for the project by mid-2018 and to make a FID in early 2019.",
            "Recent progress with the project includes the second round of public consultation in North Wales; opening a new Gloucester headquarters and expanding its Anglesey site office; launching graduate and apprenticeship schemes; appointing Lloyds Register as independent third party inspection agents; and establishing Hitachi Nuclear Energy Europe.",
            "Like Horizon, NuGen will deliver its project by securing finance from \"internal and external sources\". That means working with its shareholders and relevant governmental finance sources to get to a FID and delivering debt and equity into the structure. They aim to deliver their project within the existing policy framework which provides a CfD and access to UK government guarantees.",
            "A joint venture between Toshiba and Engie, NuGen plans to build a nuclear power plant of up to 3.8 GWe gross capacity at Moorside in West Cumbria. NuGen says it combines the strengths of its two globally-recognised parent companies, with proven operating and engineering experience, and AP1000 nuclear reactor technology provided by Westinghouse Electric Company, a group company of Toshiba.",
            "Alastair Evans, head of government affairs at NuGen, told",
            ", \"NuGen is confident of timescale deliveries. Westinghouse is delivering AP1000s in China and the US and this gives certainty to the market what we are aiming to deliver at our Moorside project.\"",
            "Sanmen 1 in China's Zhejiang province is expected to be the first Westinghouse AP1000 to begin operating. Four AP1000 reactors are being built in the USA - two each at Vogtle and Summer - while three AP1000s are also proposed for the Moorside site.",
            "reported in March that the integrated head package had been installed on top of the reactor pressure vessel of Sanmen 1 and that the unit is expected to start operations in September.",
            "Both Toshiba and Engie have said they are fully committed to the project all the way up to FID, Evans said, which NuGen expects to make by the end of 2018.",
            "Managed by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the Environment Agency, the GDA process has its origins in the UK government's White Paper on Nuclear Power of January 2008.",
            "Alan McGoff, policy lead for nuclear new build at the Environment Agency, told delegates it could not be predicted then that GDA \"would be quite the success or attract quite the overseas interest which it has\".",
            "McGoff noted that GDA is a voluntary process - \"policy rather than law\" - but is a \"government expectation\" that is \"certainly recognised as a significant contribution\" to a project.",
            "\"Good regulation is key to good investment decisions - it's able to identify the key issues associated with any design and to resolve them before you start construction; because once you start building that's when the big money is going in,\" he said. \"It can have an early influence and it's much easier to change a design before you've poured concrete.\"",
            "The ultimate positive outcome of the GDA process is issuance of a Design Acceptance Confirmation (DAC) from the ONR and a Statements of Design Acceptability (SoDA) from the Environment Agency. Before this, an interim DAC and an interim SoDA are issued.",
            "\"One of Hitachi's key objectives is to avoid that step,\" McDoff said. They want to move straight to DAC and SoDA, not as happened with the UK EPR or the AP1000.\"",
            "The UK EPR design received a DAC and SoDA in December 2012. The UK ABWR began the GDA process in January 2014 and \"remains on target for completion\", McDoff said, at the end of 2017. The AP1000 reached the iDAC and iSoDA stage in Dec 2011, but then Westinghouse paused the process until its owner Toshiba bought a stake in NuGen. It restarted the process in January 2015. The indicative completion date for the AP1000 has been revised to March 2017, McGoff said.",
            "The ONR and Environment Agency are \"principles-based regulators\", he said, and do not follow a \"rule ticking approach\". \"Regulation by principles is very powerful regulation,\" he said. \"It requires the vendor to understand what it is they're trying to achieve and to prove to themselves that that can be achieved before they demonstrate it to us. It makes it a much more intelligent level of regulation.\"",
            "And before a nuclear site licence is granted, the ONR \"needs to be satisfied that the applicant's choice of site is suitable, that it understands the hazards and risks of its activities that it proposes to carry out, and there is a suitable schedule of safety submissions moving through to the pre-construction safety case,\" he said. Before environmental permits would be issued, \"we must be satisfied that the site specific proposals are acceptable and meet best available techniques required,\" he said.",
            "Investment decisions can and do affect the regulators in terms of allocation of resources, he said. \"It's worth reflecting that the FID decision [by EDF] isn't just about Hinkley Point C. It's about four significant packages of work associated with the construction of that plant, the development of Sizewell C and Bradwell B, and the GDA for the Hualong One - the Chinese designed reactor,\" he said. The regulators are also working with the Department of Energy and Climate Change on a future small modular reactor program.",
            "\"Both the ONR and the Environment Agency are fully resourced for the work we're doing now,\" he said. \"Within the Environment Agency, we've always treated new build as an extremely high priority. However, going forward, it is going to become more difficult. We are making moves to grow our own talent and also looking at ways to train regulators with experience of other industries to give them nuclear skills.\"",
            "Completing the UK regulatory process lends international appeal to a project, McGoff told",
            ", by \"adding value to your design and giving greater levels of confidence\". He added: \"The UK regulatory system is recognised as one of the best in the world and I think it does give the opportunity to take that [expertise] outside. And I think that's part of the reason why we've seen such interest in GDA.\"",
            "Asked if a Requesting Party with a reactor design that is already in operation has an advantage in the GDA process, McGoff said: \"I believe they do, the reason being that they will know much more of the evidence to support their design and that makes producing submissions that demonstrate the design can achieve the safety, security and environmental claims that are required so much easier because the evidence should be there.\" He added: \"But even then, the UK will ask more questions to illustrate if somebody said, 'We have a rule in our [national] regulatory regime which means that we have achieved this tick in the box', we will say, 'That’s really interesting, but is that rule correct?' We're not saying it's wrong; it's not for us to challenge other regulators, but is that rule right? You need to convince yourself that the rule is OK. And that helps to produce a much more intelligent dialogue than simple compliance with a rule.\"",
            "National Grid is also waiting for EDF to reach a FID, said its head of major infrastructure development, Sue Adam. EDF Energy was granted a Development Consent Order for a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point early this year.",
            "\"People want to know when construction will start [at HPC],\" Adam told delegates.\"We're currently at low-level engagement. Until we get the news of EDF's FID we're staying quite quiet. Once we've got EDF's FID, we know what our program is and we'll align it and then we’ll be able to go out and start re-engaging with the community in order to explain what our construction activities are going to look like.",
            "\"Construction of this connection isn't going to happen all at the same time. We'll interact with Western Power Distribution. We have a sequential nature to the works, so therefore we'll be able to make our activities in the shorter term, while other activities will not happen for a number of years.\"",
            "The Hinkley Connection project will involve a National Grid 400kV network, consisting of: a 56km connection (49km overhead and 8km underground); two substations and a sealing end compound; upgrading and re-configuring Western Power Distribution's 132kV network; removing 67km of overhead line; laying 10km underground; and making modifications to the existing network. The project will introduce the new T-pylon design to the grid, she said, adding that HPC will require 116 T-pylons.",
            "For the other two new build plans, she said proposals are being developed for formal consultation for the North Wales Connection project, connecting Wylfa Newydd - including a 40km connection beneath Menai Strait, and the North West Coast Connections project, connecting Moorside - including a 142km connection with a 22km tunnel under Morecambe Bay.",
            "All three of the new nuclear build project owners aim to develop a supply chain that enables 60% of the construction value to be delivered by UK companies. EDF Energy has selected preferred bidders for work on HPC, which include, for example, Balfour Beatty Bailey, Laing O'Rourke, Premier Interlink WACO UK Ltd, ABB UK, Schneider Electric and Clyde Union.",
            "Hitachi Nuclear Energy Europe, which began operations as Hitachi's UK arm on 1 April, is \"managing the knowledge transfer of Hitachi's experience from 23 BWR projects and combining this with UK expertise\", said Shunsuke Utena, managing director of the subsidiary. Since 2012, Hitachi-GE has supported Horizon under a front end engineering design, or FEED, contract. Utena told the conference Horizon will soon enter into a Tier-1 joint venture, \"forming a world class delivery team\", with the first strategic Tier-2s likely to be selected soon afterwards. It expects to hold a supplier event this autumn.",
            "Terry Morgan, chairman of the new high-frequency, high-capacity railway for London and the South East, Crossrail, said: \"I can't tell you just how important community engagement is. Ignore that detail at your peril.\"",
            "The £14.8 billion project consists of a new railway 118 km in length and 40 (ten new) stations to deliver 24 trains per hour, making 200 million journeys per year. It will be \"leaving a skills legacy\", Morgan said. As of April this year, the project included 16,543 apprentices, 14,000 people employed on the project and 4398 jobs for local people. Some 63% of spending on the project will go to small- and medium-sized businesses outside London, he added.",
            "EDF Energy has invested more than £11 million in the local area around Hinkley, including training and education.",
            "David Eccles, head of communications for the HPC project, told delegates the consultation process - which started in October 2008 - had \"gone on for longer than any of us would have wanted, but one of the advantages of this long engagement is that those people with whom we were talking during the consultation phase are now the people we are working with to deliver the project in a local sense\". He added: \"Local stakeholders, whether they are business organisations, businesses themselves, local authorities, we've been working with them over the duration of this consultation, getting their thoughts and feedback, adjusting our plans, and, in the light of that feedback, continuing to work with them.\"",
            "The company also \"talks to its neighbours\" immediately adjacent to the site, Eccles said, \"about the issues that concern them - traffic, noise, dust, light - and we talk to the broader community about the implications of the project on their lives and the way that they are going to be necessarily disrupted.\" He added: \"But equally there are lots of opportunities for them and we discuss those in what we call community forums, to which bodies like Stop Hinkley and others are also invited.\"",
            "\"The face-to-face stuff is really important\", he said. \"You can do a huge amount by social media and through our website, but it's actually getting out there, living in the community, having our team based in the community, and engaging with them on a day-to-day basis, not just in a HPC context, but in the broader context of being members of that community from a social, leisure and every other point of view. By doing that, and embedding ourselves, and using these mechanisms, we keep the communication going.\"",
            "Proof of this, he said, is a national survey that asked, 'To what extent do you think that nuclear should be part of the energy mix in the future and nationally?'. \"The answer to that question is about 55%. Immediately around Hinkley and up to about 12-15 miles away, the response is 65%. That demonstrates that local people understand the opportunities presented in terms of skills and employment and business because of this engagement.\"",
            "One of the biggest potential benefits of the HPC project, he said, lies with the supply chain. \"We're working very closely with our Tier 1s to involve UK business and in particular those in the South West. At the end of last year we announced £225 million of contracts at the preferred bidder stage for local companies. In addition, we have a direct contractual relationship with a number of Tier 3 providers.\"",
            "Local companies supporting the HPC site itself include, for example, Somerset Larder, which provides catering services using locally produced food and drink. This is a local joint venture that the project was \"the catalyst to create\", Eccles said. Similarly, the project requires 600,000 steel embedment plates to fix all the reinforcement steel bars. \"We've gone to the steel fabricators in and around Somerset, they've got together to form a joint venture and they are bidding for a portion of that steel fabrication contract.\" He added: \"When people see this is touching their lives and bringing benefits to them, then they are naturally predisposed towards the project.\"",
            "HPC will require, he said, \"160 Tier 1 contractors, all the subsidiary activity beneath that and then all the logistics supply chain beneath that\". EDF Energy is working with Somerset Chamber of Commerce and other business organisations to support companies \"to enable them to get to the standard, whether by entering the South West area's Fit for Nuclear program, or other schemes, so that they can compete effectively for contracts\". The company is also working with central government \"to be able to provide the funds whereby business support is in place in order to maximise the opportunity\".",
            "The level of unemployment in Somerset is less than 2%, he said. \"So the challenge now is how do we engage local skills providers, local businesses who are inevitably going to lose staff to the Hinkley project as they get sucked into its vortex?\" One of the company's solutions for this is its Inspire program through which it engages with education establishments. The program has had more than 100,000 \"student engagements\" in the last four years - to stimulate interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM subjects).",
            "\"Four years ago Bridgewater College had 75 engineering apprentices. This academic year they have 520. That's not entirely down to us, but a large part of it is stimulated by giving young people this focus on the STEM subjects,\" Eccles said. \"The idea of a Silicon Valley may be fanciful, but nonetheless our legacy should be a real culture and a capacity within the local area whereby young people can move into these skills which will in turn attract businesses to come or to remain in the South West because they know the workforce is available for them. That's our real legacy and our real ambition.\""
