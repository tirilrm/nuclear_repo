            "Bishkek says it is in serious need of ‘alternative sources of revenue’",
            "Kyrgyzstan, which is considering construction of its first nuclear power plant, has lifted a ban on uranium extraction to boost the economy with lawmakers overturning a 2019 law banning the research, exploration and development of uranium reserves, the Kyrgyz parliament said in a statement. ",
            "The government has said it is lifting the ban because of a “serious need for alternative sources of revenue”. ",
            "Populist president Sadyr Japarov has long called for state-led production in the extractive industries, a policy that he first championed more than a decade ago as an opposition politician.",
            "Addressing locals earlier this year in his native Issyk-Kul Province about plans to develop Kyzyl-Ompol – a uranium deposit licensed to a private investor at the time the ban was enforced – Japarov said the site would now be “100%” developed by the state.",
            "The lifting of the ban comes as Kyrgyzstan is considering the possibility of deploying a small modular reactor power plant supplied by Russia’s state-owned nuclear corporation Rosatom, according to the central Asian country’s energy minister.",
            "Russian official news agency Tass reported minister Taalaibek Ibraev as telling Kyrgyzstan’s parliament that Kyrgyzstan is “studying the options” for building two 55-MW SMR units.",
            "In November 2022, the central Asian country signed an agreement with Rosatom to cooperate on nuclear energy, including SMR plants and nuclear infrastructure.",
            "AP reported that Kyrgyzstan’s economy suffered during the Covid-19 pandemic. It has also been hit more recently indirectly by Western sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine invasion. ",
            "It said Kyrgyzstan still has millions of cubic metres of toxic and radioactive waste left over from Soviet times and the uranium ban was introduced following anti-nuclear protests.",
            "Central Asia served as an important source of uranium in the former Soviet Union. According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), large amount of radioactively contaminated material was placed in mining waste dumps and tailing sites. ",
            "The EBRD said contaminated material is a threat to the environment and the health of the population. The hazards include the possible pollution of ground and surface water in a key agricultural centre of the region.",
            "A dedicated environmental remediation account, managed by the EBRD, was established in 2015 at the initiative of the European Union to deal with the legacy of Soviet-era uranium mining in Central Asia. ",
            "The EU is the fund’s biggest donor, while contributions have also been made by Belgium, Lithuania, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the US."

            "Greens across Europe appear to have been one of the main casualties, predicted to lose around 18 seats in the new European Parliament.",
            "Most EU countries where the EPP won have plans to expand or build new nuclear units for the first time, including advanced reactors and small modular reactors. Those countries include Poland, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden and Finland. In other EU nuclear countries such as the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, the EPP has come second."

            "Belgium, which is phasing out its nuclear power plants, will not meet European targets for renewable energy and greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030, even if the key policy measures are implemented, the independent Federal Planning Bureau has warned.",
            "The European target is to increase the share of renewable energy in Belgium to at least 32% by 2030, but Belgium’s current policies predict this share will only reach 24%.",
            "Additionally, Belgium will fall short of the goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 47% compared to 2005 levels. Some sectors, such as residential and services, will make significant progress, achieving reductions of 54% and 62%, respectively. However, the transport sector will only see a modest reduction of 11%, partly due to the slow transition from fossil fuels in this sector. ",
            "In the longer term, Belgium’s emissions will decline more slowly, partially due to the delayed phaseout of carbon-based energy in industry and electricity production. ",
            "“By 2050, these sectors would still be significantly using fossil fuels. This indicates the need for either stringent pricing in the emissions trading system or an incentive-based policy focused on emission-free technologies,” the planning bureau said.",
            "Belgium plans to revise its energy mix, relying more on wind, solar, and gas. Nuclear energy and bioenergy are set to be phased out according to current legislation.",
            "This is despite prime minister Alexander De Croo’s recently support of nuclear energy. In March, he hosted the first Nuclear Energy Summit in Brussels, emphasising the importance of nuclear power for achieving energy security and climate goals. ",
            "However, the phaseout legislation has been championed by his party for over two decades and the plan to gradually reduce nuclear energy production remains, with the last two nuclear power plants scheduled to shut down by 2035. Nuclear production will primarily be replaced by wind power. ",
            "",

            "Canadian power utility SaskPower said it has made significant progress in its search for a potential host site for the province’s first small modular reactor (SMR) facility, identifying two “high-potential” sites.",
            "The company said in a statement on 31 May that the that have been identified for further study are on the Boundary Dam Reservoir and the Rafferty Reservoir, both in the Estevan area, just north of the US-Canada border. ",
            "This comes following analysis of the Estevan study area, coupled with public feedback and Indigenous engagement which SaskPower will continue throughout the project. Another area, around Elbow, a village about 140 km south of the provincial capital Saskatoon, had also been under consideration.",
            "“In addition to the technical suitability of the sites, the Estevan region offers many benefits, including proximity to the City of Estevan to access existing services, a skilled workforce, accommodations and emergency services, as well as infrastructure, roads and transmission,” said SaskPower president and chief executive officer Rupen Pandya. ",
            "“Selecting a site for the first SMR facility will allow us to proceed with the many regulatory processes which are site-specific and critical to the project moving forward.”",
            "SaskPower said it will now begin detailed site assessment of each potential site throughout 2024, leading to a final site selection in 2025. The company hopes to make a final investment decision in 2029.",
            "Over the coming months, the utility will begin additional studies to collect ground water and geotechnical details, while also conducting detailed land and water analyses.",
            "",
            "SaskPower anticipates construction of its first SMR could begin as early as 2030, with a targeted in-service date of 2034. Additional facilities could begin construction as early as 2034.",
            "The government said up to CAD50m (€33m, $36m) for the project has been committed to SaskPower from a CAD250m programme to support pre-development activities of clean electricity projects of national significance.",
            "Additionally, over CAD24m has been committed to the government of Saskatchewan from the environment department’s future electricity fund.

            "Clear signals would help ensure delivery of enrichment services as governments move away from Russia, boss tells NucNet",
            "Enrichment services provider Urenco “needs to see action” behind ambitious plans and announcements by western governments on increasing installed nuclear capacity, according to the company’s chief executive Boris Schucht.",
            "Schucht told a meeting with journalists in Brussels that “clear signals” to the industry on what the demand scenarios might be would help facilitate enrichment services delivery.",
            "Future demand for nuclear fuel and related enrichment services could come from two sources – new-build deployment, with proposed conventional or advanced reactors across Europe and North America coming online in the 2030s, and a strategic supply shift away from Russian fuel imports for existing and future fleets.",
            "“Some governments are already working on this,” Schucht said. “We see a clear will to shift away from Russian enrichment supplies in the US.”",
            "“Although there are no sanctions in place, we see countries and companies in the EU also moving away from Russian supply, there is just not complete consensus at a member state level,” he said.",
            "Earlier this month, US president Joe Biden signed legislation banning the import of Russian enriched uranium, starting a 90-day countdown until limits on shipments take effect.",
            "The legislation also unlocked some $2.7bn (€2.5bn) in spending, previously approved by Congress to build up domestic uranium supplies for US nuclear plants.",
            "In Europe, although some member states have called for sanctions on Russia’s nuclear industry, a consensus has not been reached in Brussels. Hungary has been opposed to nuclear sanctions on Moscow, but other countries, reportedly including Bulgaria, Slovakia, Finland and France have remained ambiguous on the matter.",
            "Data in the latest annual report of the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA), the body responsible for the supervision of uranium supply and demand in the EU, has shown that despite the fall in natural uranium deliveries from Russia in 2022, utilities operating Russian-designed nuclear plants had been increasing their fuel stocks until alternative fuel is available and licensed.",
            "This has led to an increase in the conversion and enrichment services delivered from Russia by 30% and 22% respectively year on year.",
            "However, 62% of enrichment services to EU utilities originated from two EU-based companies, Urenco, operating facilities in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK, and France’s Orano.",
            "In the US, according to the US Energy Information Administration, Russia has been supplying about 24% of enriched uranium with 12% from Germany and 11% from the UK. The US itself supplies 27%.",
            "",
            "Western enrichers, including Urenco, have enough capacity to meet western demand for enrichment services, according to Schucht.",
            "Uranium conversion is a “potential bottleneck” in the supply chain, he said, but Urenco “has enough stock” to feeds its centrifuge facilities.",
            "However, investment decisions for the opening of future conversion facilities should be taken within two years, Schucht warned.",
            "There is a “momentum” in how nuclear power is perceived by the public that “I have not seen for the last 30 years”, said Schucht. ",
            "“Public opinion is more positive at the possibility of more energy provision via nuclear. I believe energy security concerns in the light of the Ukraine conflict and the need for the decarbonisation of economies to meet net zero have been the drivers behind this.”",
            "Urenco has embarked on a capital investment programme to build more of the long and mid-term enrichment capacity across all its sites in the US, Netherlands, UK, and Germany.",
            "In July 2023, Urenco approved an investment to refurbish and extend uranium enrichment capacity at its US site in New Mexico, known as UUSA – a move sparked largely by new commitments from US customers for non-Russian reactor fuel.",
            "In December 2023, the company said it will refurbish and extend the production capacity of its existing plant in Almelo, the Netherlands, while capacity modernisation efforts are ongoing at the Gronau facility in Germany. ",
            "Earlier in May 2024, the UK government announced it will provide £196m (€227m, $244m) to Urenco to build a dedicated high essay low enriched uranium (Haleu) enrichment facility at its existing site in Capenhurst, northern England.",
            "The facility will have the capacity to produce up to 10 metric tonnes of Haleu per year by 2031.",
            "",
            "Russia is currently the only commercial source of Haleu fuels in the US and Europe.",
            "Haleu is an essential nuclear fuel required for the development of most next-generation small modular and advanced reactor (SMR/AMR) designs in the western world and production of irradiation targets and fuel for research reactors.",
            "According to Schucht, regarding the deployment of SMRs and AMRs “there is a chicken and egg problem” because pilot reactors have not been deployed, but fuel needs to be available around the time investment decisions are made.",
            "To solve it, “clearer signals” are needed on first-of-a-kind projects when it comes to SMR and AMR pilot deployment, Schucht said.",
            "He welcomed open commitments by the UK, US, and EU governments on the SMR front and said Urenco is “in discussions with the UK and US government on advanced fuels.”",
            "Schucht said Urenco does not need government funding for its regular enrichment capacity projects as those can attract private investment but would welcome state support for the advanced fuels market “to get it kick-started because it is a nascent market where customer contracts cannot at the moment underwrite any investment.”",
            "At the Cop28 climate conference in Dubai in late 2023, leaders from the US, Canada, France, Japan and the UK – a group of G7 nations informally known as the Sapporo 5 – announced plans to mobilise $4.2bn in government-led investments to develop “a secure, reliable global” nuclear energy supply chain in an effort to reduce Russian dominance in the sector."

            "Starmer, who according to polls is expected to be UK’s next prime minister, said the company will resemble large energy companies in Europe such as France’s EDF and Sweden’s Vattenfall and will oversee and fulfil Labour’s green energy policy giving a priority to nuclear power and renewables. ",
            "Speaking in Scotland on 31 May as part of his campaign ahead of the 4 July election, Starmer also launched an energy policy that sees Britain producing 100% of its electricity from green energy by 2030 from the current level of just over 50%, producing home-grown energy and reducing bills.  ",
            "Starmer said Great British Energy, to be based in Scotland, will be funded by a windfall tax on oil companies, but added he would have to scale back his earlier projection to spend £28bn (€32bn, $35bn) on green energy, although still spending more than the Conservative Party did, according to Sky News.  ",
            "According to the BBC, the Labour Party has said that although Great British Energy will not be an energy retail company, it will generate power in its own right, as well as owning, managing and operating clean power projects alongside private firms. Details are expected to be in Labour’s manifesto, which is being published in the coming weeks.",
            "",
            "To coincide with Starmer’s Great British Energy policy launch, the UK’s Nuclear Industry Association (NIA) published on 31 May its own “once in a generation” manifesto. ",
            "The manifesto lists a pipeline of projects for the industry and sets five key actions for MPs elected on 4 July to support during the next parliament to ensure momentum within the nuclear sector is sustained.",
            "The actions include progressing the Sizewell C nuclear power station project leading to a final investment decision by autumn 2024 and extending the life of UK’s current power stations, as well as building a fleet of small modular reactors (SMRs) across the country. ",
            "The manifesto calls for the construction of a third large-scale station at Wylfa on Anglesey.",
            "It says the UK should aim to become the best place to develop and deploy advanced nuclear reactors and maximising the UK’s fuel manufacturing capability and completing the selecting of a suitable site in a supportive and willing community for a geological disposal facility. ",
            "“Delivering new nuclear projects from Sizewell C and Wylfa to SMRs and nuclear fuel, will bring huge investment to communities and reliable, clean energy for a very long time,” NIA’s chief executive Tom Greatrex said.",
            "“I welcome Labour’s commitment to progress vital new nuclear projects as part of its Great British energy plan. Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C will be cornerstones of the UK’s clean energy revolution, providing reliable zero-carbon power for 12 million people for over 80 years, creating thousands of good, green jobs.

            "The European Union should support the domestic production of clean hydrogen with a range of measures that include recognising the potential of all net-zero technologies and developing policies for the industry’s growth, the Brussels-based nuclear industry group nucleareurope has said.",
            "The group said in a position paper that the EU should encourage a diversified approach to clean hydrogen production while pushing for investments in infrastructure that support domestic production, storage, and distribution.",
            "In the position paper, nucleareurope calls on legislators to allocate resources for research and development into improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of hydrogen production technologies, including nuclear-based methods.",
            "The paper says EU-based hydrogen production is the key to energy sovereignty and industrial competitiveness, but notes that “for the time being, the European Commission’s focus is primarily on hydrogen produced exclusively from renewables, with a significant share of this hydrogen being imported from third countries, notably from the global south”.",
            "“This will result in an important increase in energy demand due to transportation and losses while potentially exploiting countries where energy poverty is high and affecting Europe’s energy sovereignty by creating a dependency on imported renewable hydrogen,” the paper says. ",
            "It says these plans are expected to lead to an increase in the downstream costs relating to compression, storage, and transport. “Enhanced quality assurance in terms of environmental impact and chemical purity of the imported hydrogen will also increase costs.”",
            "According to nucleareurope, the EU’s REPowerEU plan to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels and speed up the green transition foresaw 10 million tonnes (Mt) of domestic hydrogen production complemented with 6-10 Mt of imported hydrogen by 2030. But this was later downsized to 3 Mt, perhaps to align it with the realistic forecasts of domestic production via renewables, nucleareurope said. ",
            "“This is where other low-carbon energy sources, such as nuclear, could fill the gap and help meet the original ambitions, as the main target remains unchanged: net zero by 2050.”",
            "According to the position paper, in their recent energy plans, countries such as France and Belgium have included the goal of becoming a leader in clean hydrogen production and building a national hydrogen industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from energy intensive sectors such as industry and transport. ",
            "“Domestic production of hydrogen can help solve some of the challenges which the EU is facing in terms of energy security, environmental sustainability, and economic competitiveness,” said nucleareurope director-general Yves Desbazeille. ",
            "“Reimagining how hydrogen, a versatile and clean energy carrier, can play an important leading role in transforming the energy system is key in this respect.”",
            "Clean hydrogen, also known as green hydrogen, is produced by transmitting electricity produced by a nuclear plant – or another low-carbon energy facility such as solar – to electrolysers. It can be used for industry, transport and home heating, at the sites where the hydrogen is needed.",
            "The International Energy Agency has said there are encouraging signs that clean hydrogen technology is on the cusp of significant cost declines and widespread global growth. It said clean hydrogen could play a major role in energy systems and serve all sectors of the economy, replacing fossil fuels and helping mitigate global warming.",
            "Nuclear reactors can viably produce clean, or green hydrogen by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. Methods are being explored to use nuclear energy to produce hydrogen from water by electrolysis, thermochemical, and hybrid processes. ",
            "According to the International Energy Agency, annual global dedicated hydrogen production stands at around 70 million tonnes. The US Department of Energy says a single 1,000-MW nuclear reactor could produce more than 200,000 tonnes of hydrogen each year.",

            "The banking sector has started to warm up to the idea of financing new nuclear projects, but challenges remain to be addressed including how projects are structured, according to Ximena Vásquez-Maignan, Counsel at the Paris office of international law firm White & Case. ",
            "Vásquez-Maignan, a project finance lawyer who specialises in nuclear law and liability, told NucNet that banks are “really looking at nuclear power”, but need “to understand the sector and associated risks”, while they also “need to discuss with the nuclear sector on how to structure nuclear projects”.",
            "She said banks have been traditionally reluctant to finance new large nuclear power plants because construction has been exposed to cost and schedule overruns. However, some banks have provided loans or green bonds for the lifetime extension or maintenance of large reactors, notably in Canada, France and Brazil.",
            "“One very important aspect is structuring the project,” said Vásquez-Maignan. “Who is going to be the borrower: the operator or the owner of the nuclear power plant? Sometimes the operator and owner are separate entities, and in other instances it is one single entity.”",
            "Another issue could be the application of nuclear liability regimes.",
            "Vásquez-Maignan said: “For the banks, the question is always about allocating the risks and especially what happens in the case of a nuclear accident. Does nuclear liability, which is a special regime that provides for the exclusive and absolute liability of the nuclear operator, apply? Are the banks going to get sued if there is an accident? Who bears the brunt of the cost?”",
            "The inability to exercise usual stepping rights, or rights for a third-party funder to take over a project if its owner becomes insolvent, because of the regulatory framework applicable to the nuclear sector could be another barrier to the large-scale involvement of commercial banks in nuclear power projects.",
            "“Nuclear operators require to have the technical knowhow, relevant experience and financial capacity, and on top of that they need regulatory authorisation,” Vásquez-Maignan said. ",
            "In March, a spokesperson for the European Investment Bank, the EU’s multilateral tasked with development support, told NucNet that any project which the bank is to finance must be “bankable”, meaning that strict economic assessment criteria apply to selection.",
            "The key criteria for bankability vary across financiers but may include the probability of meeting the project’s financial, environmental and social goals, sufficient estimated cash flows to cover costs and produce returns that meet investor expectations.",
            "According to Vásquez-Maignan, banks also care about financial visibility around projects, which is the ability to attain accurate and relevant information in order to optimise decision making.",
            "“They want to have a business model they know they can rely on, that they can run the numbers on,” she said.  “Now the big thing is that a large nuclear power plant can generate a lot of energy, so a lot of revenue, for at least 60 years.”",
            "Experts and industry have called in recent years for renewed government support for a revival of nuclear power.",
            "Mark Muldowney, managing director for energy, resources and infrastructure at banking group BNP Paribas, told a nuclear conference in France last year that the best way of approaching the financing of new nuclear power plants is a model which involves risk sharing, including forms of state support.",
            "Muldowney said that the investment of “staggering amounts” in nuclear capacity deployment would require risk that can only be taken by two parties – governments and final consumers. Investors will not be inclined to put many billions into large-scale nuclear projects, if they are not confident of risk guarantees.",
            "France’s president Emmanuel Macron told a nuclear energy summit in Brussels in March that if France is to achieve a ramp-up of its nuclear power programme “we need to attract a lot of private investment to nuclear energy, which could be a huge source of industrial development and job creation”.",
            "The ministerial declaration from the inaugural Nuclear Energy Summit  in Brussels, in which 37 countries took part, addressed the need for a level-playing field in financing nuclear power.",
            "The same event saw a ministerial declaration calling for “concrete measures in support of nuclear energy, including tools such as direct public financing, guarantees to debt and equity providers and schemes to share revenue and pricing risks”.",
            "",
            "The declaration invited multinational development banks, international financial institutions and regional bodies to consider strengthening their support for financing nuclear energy projects and to “support the establishment of a financial level playing field for all zero emission sources of energy generation”.",
            "Asked about the emergence of small modular reactors (SMRs) and options to finance them, Vásquez-Maignan said that “from the financial perspective, this will be a whole new market depending on the type and size of the SMR”.",
            "“We are really starting the discussion now. We're going to see how it’s going to evolve, for example in some cases the SMR vendor itself is going to be the owner and the operator of the reactor.”",
            "She said some banking concerns that apply to large-scale reactor projects will still mostly apply to SMRs, an area where “support by the government is extremely important for the financial sector”. ",
            "According to Muldowney, SMRs might be different because the investment involved is “relatively small” compared to large reactors and this could “make the whole structure more financeable in ways that large corporate players can support”.",
            "“We need to find the right structure to provide debt and equity for SMR projects. It is still a challenge, but an achievable one,” he said.",

            "IEA report points to ‘opportunities for a nuclear comeback’",
            "US domestic production of uranium remained at historically low levels in 2023 and it is too early to tell if high prices and supply initiatives will be enough to encourage Western suppliers to expand production, the International Energy Agency said in its Global Critical Minerals Outlook 2024. ",
            "The agency said several governments have recently announced moves to reduce dependence on Russia. ",
            "In January 2023, the US Department of Energy announced awards to the conversion industry to develop its strategic uranium reserve. In April 2023, Canada, France, Japan, the UK and the US announced an agreement to support the stable supply of nuclear fuel and “undermine Russia’s grip” on nuclear fuel supply chains. ",
            "Since then, the UK and the US have announced moves to encourage the development of highly enriched reactor fuel known as Haleu that is needed for a new breed of advanced nuclear reactors that are under development. ",
            "The US has also passed legislation banning imports of enriched uranium from Russia, which provides about a quarter of the reactor fuel in the US, making it the country’s top supplier.",
            "After a decade of slow deployment, a changing policy landscape is creating opportunities for a nuclear comeback, the IEA noted.",
            "Nuclear power capacity could increase from 420 GW in 2023 to 500 GW by 2030 and 770 GW by 2050, with growth mainly in China and other developing economies, while advanced economies carry out lifetime extensions and look to build new projects to offset retirements. ",
            "Large-scale reactors remain the dominant form, but growing interest in small modular reactors increases the potential for nuclear power in the long run.",
            "The IEA said that while it is too early to tell if high prices and supply supports seen in 2023 will be encourage Western suppliers to expand production, some producers including Cameco in Canada and Uranium Energy Corp in the US have announced that they will restart production in 2024 at previously mothballed facilities."

            "Three or more advanced reactor applications expected within 12 months, but investment needed in new capacity",
            "Nuclear energy remains the key to unlocking a cleaner, more secure future, but investment is needed in new capacity along with incentives, grants and support for next-generation reactors and the current fleet, Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) president and chief executive officer Maria Korsnick has said.",
            "“At every level of society – across borders and aisles and industries and sectors – support for nuclear has materialised into demand,” Korsnick said during an annual state of the industry address on 15 May. “And the race to realise its potential is officially underway.”",
            "She said: “One thing Vogtle has taught us: with every new unit, we learn something new,” Korsnick said during an annual state of the industry address on 14 May, referring to the two recently completed AP1000 reactor units in the US state of Georgia. ",
            "“The construction gets more efficient, the costs get more reasonable. The risks decrease, the benefits increase,” she said. “We need to ensure that early movers go forward and therefore incentives and grants are needed,” she said. ",
            "“So, we work with [the US] Congress to reduce the cost of first-of-a- kind. The US, the Congress, has approved tax credits, also hydrogen tax credits, so that we get a robust hydrogen economy. So, we need national leaders to continue this process,” Korsnick said.",
            "A recent study by Washington-based power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies predicts the grid will need to add 38 GW, or more, of new electricity capacity during the next five years, driven by advanced computing, artificial intelligence, and the electrification of the manufacturing and transportation sectors, Korsnick said.",
            "",
            "Over the next 12 months, three or more applications for advanced modular reactors are expected to be submitted to the US nuclear Regulatory Commission and two or more advanced reactor projects are expected to begin construction, according to Korsnick",
            "Additionally, the “Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is likely to approve the construction permit for the GE-Hitachi BWRX-300 at Ontario's Darlington site,” she said.",
            "In addition to 12 submittals for 20-year licence renewals, one more plant will be added to this list and will submit a licence renewal application to the NRC this year, Korsnick also said.",
            "“Several utilities are preparing numerous power uprates, with a cumulative capacity increase of approximately 2.5 GW of new carbon-free generation, the equivalent of more than two large light-water-reactors,” Korsnick said.",
            "“Utilities are now extending the lives of some plants to 80 years and taking steps to restart others, like Holtec’s Palisades plant in Michigan, while in California, the Department of Energy reached an agreement with PG&E to support extending operations of Diablo Canyon,” Korsnick noted, saying that “since her last speech [in 2023] , we have seen significant progress in the industry”.",
            "Korsnick said that over the last 12 months the industry has advanced more applications through the regulatory process, including applications from Kairos Power, NuScale and the Bill Gates-founded TerraPower, which submitted a construction permit application for its Kemmerer, Wyoming Natrium plant and plans to break ground “just a few weeks from now”.",
            "The “NEI is also working with Houston-based Shepherd Power to significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to licence microreactors, from an average of five years per application to just four months. “A shift in [the licensing] paradigm will have benefits for small modular reactors and large reactors too,” she said. ",
            "",
            "“While Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much, they agree that nuclear is the key to both national security and global competitiveness, Korsnick said. ",
            "She said other nations need nuclear energy and “they want to do business with us”.",
            "The NEI hosted meetings last year with more than 20 countries interested in cooperating on nuclear with the US.",
            "The Philippines is starting a nuclear power programme, has already signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the US and is taking significant steps towards deployment by 2032.",
            "At the first US-Africa Nuclear Energy Summit, Ghana announced it will choose nuclear vendors by the end of the year.",
            "On the need for a secure supply of nuclear fuel, Korsnick said “we cannot continue to power our country – let alone the world – on the back of Russian uranium”.",
            "She said “re-shoring” fuel production to American soil is imperative and after lawmakers recently approved $2.72bn (€2.5bn) in funding to support a domestic fuel supply “we are one step closer to making this long-held goal a reality”.",
            "As a condition of this funding, the US Congress passed a ban on Russian uranium fuel imports and president Biden signed it into law on 13 May, Korsnick noted.",
            "“To that end, we are focused on two things: Work with the Department of Energy to ensure this funding builds a competitive domestic supply chain and revitalises US capabilities to convert and enrich uranium,” she said.",
            "The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act bars imports from Russia, but allows for temporary waivers until January 2028 if “no alternative viable source of low-enriched uranium is available to sustain the continued operation of a nuclear reactor or a United States nuclear energy company” or if the imports are determined to be in the national interest. Korsnick called for the waiver process to be “predictable and efficient”.",
            "She said advanced fuel technologies will be deployed over the next few years with enhanced accident tolerant features, increased enrichment and higher fuel efficiencies, enabling power upgrades and longer fuel cycles.",
            "She listed recent progress in advanced fuel development including Urenco’s approval of its first expansion project last year at its plant in New Mexico, Orano’s approval of a $1.8bn investment to increase enrichment capacity and the announcement that ConverDyn, the only converter in the US, had restarted its plant last year.",
            "“And Centrus started production of high assay low-enriched uranium [Haleu] in October 2023 – becoming the first new US-owned uranium enrichment plant to begin production since 1954,” Korsnick added.",
            "“The reason behind this race toward nuclear is simple,” she said. “The world needs more power, and we need it sooner than projected.”"

            "‘Scientific and business case for government’s policy has been subject to sustained challenge’",
            "There remains a “lack of certainty” around the future role of small modular reactors in the UK’s energy mix with current plans lacking clarity despite the government’s plans to pledge £215m (€251m, $269m) towards developing the new nuclear technology, the chair of the parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee said.",
            "In an earlier letter to energy secretary Clare Coutinho Philip Dunne said the committee had heard concerns from experts that “no commercial order for an SMR design has yet been placed worldwide”, raising questions about the commercial feasibility of plans to deploy units in the UK.",
            "“The scientific and business case for the government’s policy on SMRs has been subject to sustained challenge, reflected in some of the written evidence we have received,” Dunne wrote.",
            "He said evidence to the committee suggested that achieving net zero in the UK by 2050 would be hard to achieve without some form of nuclear power, whether that be gigawatt-scale nuclear reactors or SMRs.",
            "But he noted that Great British Nuclear (GBN), the government body set up to oversee SMR deployment, told the committee that the government’s target of producing “up to” 24 GW of nuclear power was not sufficient to give industry confidence about the scale of investment that would be required, and suggested that a specific programme would be required to facilitate this.",
            "In a reply dated 27 March and made public on 3 May, Coutinho said SMRs are expected to play an important part of the UK’s nuclear renaissance and GBN had launched a process with the aim of identifying those SMR technologies best able to reach a project final investment decision in the next parliament and deliver projects in the mid-2030s, “potentially releasing billions of pounds of private and public investment”.",
            "“Our aim is to deliver the fastest competition of its kind in the world,” Coutinho wrote.",
            "",
            "Coutinho said in her letter the government would “maintain flexibility” over the specific technologies it would pursue, to ensure value for money. She said the government would offer more clarity on the “optimal mix” of nuclear technologies as the programme develops. Until SMRs were deployed commercially, it would not be possible to quantify the potential savings they could offer, she wrote.",
            "In a 3 May statement Dunne said: “I thank the secretary of state for this response, though at this stage of technology development it is perhaps not surprising that it leaves several important questions unanswered. ",
            "“Will small modular reactors play a substantial role in decarbonising the UK’s energy supply? What would that cost the taxpayer and the electricity consumer? These are questions we still don’t know the answers to.",
            "“The committee cannot gain a clear picture of the cost savings SMRs could deliver, as well as the likely investment needed to enable the first SMR projects to begin generating power, until such time as the design competition has concluded and the successful bids been evaluated.",
            "“The government’s past experience with complex and often expensive nuclear projects makes its caution understandable,” Dunne said. ",
            "He said it will be down to the new parliament – due after a planned general election expected by January 2025 – to gain much greater clarity from the government on the role to be played by SMRs in decarbonising the country’s energy mix, and the resulting risks to be borne by taxpayers and electricity consumers."

            "Reactors will be first in country to use US-based Westinghouse AP1000 technology",
            "The first section of concrete has been laid as part of a ceremony to mark the official start of construction of Units 5 and 6 at the Khmelnitski nuclear power station in northwest Ukraine.",
            "State nuclear operator Energoatom said in a statement that the two units would be the first to be built in the country using US-based Westinghouse’s AP1000 pressurised water reactor (PWR) nuclear plant technology.",
            "In August 2021 Energoatom and Westinghouse signed a memorandum on the construction of five power units in Ukraine using AP1000 technology.",
            "In June 2022 they signed further agreements related to increasing the number of units from five to nine, although not all would be at Khmelnitski.",
            "Khmelnitski has two Russia-supplied PWR plants in commercial operation. Two more units, Khmelnitski-3 and -4 officially remain under construction, but both units were to be supplied by Russia and their status is unclear.

            "This suggests that nine out of Ukraine’s 15 reactors have been loaded or are being loaded with Westinghouse fuel, although the exact status of fuel loads is unclear. ",
            "With regards to Rivne, for example, which has four units, Westinghouse suggested in a September 2023 statement that one core had been loaded with its fuel, but did not give details of fuel loads for other units at the site.",
            "However, Westinghouse president and chief executive officer Patrick Fragman told the Khmelnitski ceremony that “all Ukrainian power units have gotten rid of dependence on the Russian Federation and can operate on American fuel”.",

            "There are clear opportunities for international cooperation to support resilient nuclear fuel supply chains for the production of advanced fuels such as high-assay low-enriched uranium (Haleu), Urenco’s EU government affairs director told a European Parliament panel.",
            "Hidde Baars told the Panel for the Future of Science and Technology that the size of the market to supply advanced nuclear reactors will help determine the requirement for fuel provision.",

            "Baars said Urenco has begun a significant capital investment programme to expand capacity across all its four sites in the Netherlands, the UK, Germany and the US. There are also plans for a dedicated Haleu facility in the UK.",
            "“Russia is the only commercial supplier [of HEU] and this is a serious risk,” he said. “Europe also needs HEU for medical radioisotope production. We will need new Haleu facilities within the EU within 10 years.”",
            "HEU can be downblended to produce Haleu. The other way to produce it is to enrich uranium. Traditionally, the nuclear energy industry has operated with commercial enrichments for its nuclear fuel of 5%, but Haleu is enriched from 5% to 19.75%.",
            "The panel was meeting to discuss the future of nuclear energy in the EU and a briefing paper that highlighted the importance of Haleu for advanced reactors and the EU’s dependency on Russia. ",

            "Several countries – including the US, UK, Brazil, China – have launched programmes to have a domestic source of Haleu, but Russia remains the only major supplier.",
            "Some of most promising advanced designs use Haleu, the briefing paper said. ",
            "“Haleu is said to be the future of nuclear reactors mainly because it has more fissile material compared to LEU and can therefore potentially make reactors more efficient, produce more energy, increase time between refuelling and reduce costs in the long run,” the paper said.",

            "Calls growing to end ‘senseless’ moratorium on reactor construction",
            "Serbia needs to start work on ending its moratorium on nuclear energy as it faces rising electricity consumption which can only be tackled by the construction of large and small nuclear power plants, president Aleksandar Vucic said.",
            "Vucic called for work to start on changing regulations related to new nuclear plants and to end the moratorium, which has been in force since 1989.",
            "“I just want you to know that by 2050 we will be consuming four times more electricity than today,” Vucic was quoted as saying at a government session on 4 April.",
            "“No matter what we do, no matter how we do it, we don’t stand a chance if we don’t start addressing that problem quickly. ",
            "“And solving that problem is only possible by building large and small nuclear power plants,” Vucic said, according to local press reports.",
            "At the inaugural Nuclear Energy Summit in Brussels last month Vucic said Serbia was interested in building “at least four small modular reactors (SMRs) that can replace 1,200 megawatts of capacity”.",
            "But he said Serbia does not know how to finance such a project, which he said could cost up to €8bn ($8.6bn).",
            "“We will be prepared for significant participation, but we need some kind of support from the leading countries of the European Union,” Vucic said.",
            "Vucic’s comments come as Serbia’s mining and energy ministry said it is planning to sign a memorandum of understanding on nuclear energy within a month as the government aims to develop the sector and potentially build the nation’s first commercial reactors.",
            "State secretary in the ministry Veljko Kovacevic said the MOU would be signed with “all competent institutions, agencies and organisations” active in the nuclear energy field. ",
            "“They will start analysing how to develop the sector in Serbia, he said.",
            "",
            "His comments came as the general manager of Serbia’s state-owned electric power utility Elektromreza Srbije called a moratorium on nuclear energy “senseless” and said projects are needed to develop nuclear energy in the east European country.",
            "Jelena Matejic was quoted in Balkan Green Energy News as saying nuclear energy was a part of the energy mix in Yugoslavia and the Krško nuclear power station in Slovenia, which was built and is operated jointly with neighbouring Croatia, has operated successfully since 1981.",
            "As a result of the 1986 Chernobyl accident Serbia passed a law in 1989 prohibiting the construction of nuclear power plants. It has one decommissioned research reactor and another research reactor that has been temporarily shut down.",
            "In 2022 the director of Beogradske Elektrane said Serbia should begin efforts to build first commercial nuclear power station by establishing a national nuclear energy company and holding a public hearing in parliament with the participation of “prominent nuclear energy experts”.",
            "Rade Basta said a nuclear plant would ensure a stable electricity supply and reduce the country’s use of coal. Serbia produces 70% of its electricity from coal.",
            "He said Serbia could either build a large-scale plant of about 1,000 MW or use small modular reactor technology of about 350 MW. SMRs can be integrated with renewables, gas and hydrogen units, he said."

            "“The industry has been moving towards international markets in all areas, not just nuclear decommissioning, which itself has grown in importance and now is by far the most important [nuclear power] business within Germany,” Seipolt said.",
            "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also pointed to the significance of the nuclear decommissioning market. As many nuclear plants near the end of their life cycle, a new industry based around decommissioning nuclear facilities is emerging. ",
            "In addition to nuclear plants themselves, many other facilities involved in the nuclear fuel cycle, such as research centres and facilities for reprocessing spent fuel or for waste treatment, will need to be decommissioned. ",
            "In total, it is likely that several hundred billion dollars will be spent on decommissioning worldwide between now and 2050, and businesses and investors are already securing their positions, the IAEA said.",
            "There are 420 nuclear power reactors in operation around the world, according to the IAEA. Around 200 are expected to begin the decommissioning process by 2050. ",

            "KernD spokesperson Nicolas Wendler said the industry has been “reorienting towards international markets”. ",
            "KernD admits Germany is often perceived as synonymous with criticism of nuclear energy. What is often overlooked is that it has built up a portfolio of expertise in nuclear energy and nuclear technology that is largely still available today. Nuclear research began in Germany in the 1950s and until March 2011 it generated one-quarter of its electricity from nuclear energy with 17 reactors.",
            "According to KernD, Germany’s expertise in decommissioning has expanded in recent years with key players able to handle the entire portfolio of dismantling and decontamination services. Major companies such as Framatome, Westinghouse and Gesellschaft für Nuklear-Service (GNS) are supported by numerous specialist companies that offer radiation protection, the operation of waste processing centres and documentation services. ",
            "“The fact that most European countries that use nuclear energy have abandoned phaseout policies and are continuing to extend the lifetimes of nuclear power plants means that this business area can continue to exist for quite a long time,” KernD said. ",
            "Almost one year ago, in April 2023, Germany took its last three nuclear reactors offline  in a decision that critics warned would only lead to more fossil fuels being burned to generate electricity. ",
            "Since the shutdowns, three political parties have called for a reversal of the anti-nuclear policy with leading members of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) alliance and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) saying they want to restart decommissioned reactors and build new ones. ",
            "",
            "CDU leader Friedrich Merz has said that shutting down the last reactors was a “black day for Germany”. The parties also say that old reactors should be reconnected to the grid. Merz says that the country should restart the last three power plants that were shut down — citing climate protection, as well as rising oil and gas prices.",
            "Germany’s nuclear industry also stands ready to make a significant contribution in the market for services related to new build. ",
            "“The major challenge for the western nuclear industry is to build [nuclear plants] on time and on budget,” Wendler said. “Streamlining construction, tightening quality control and having a reliable and precise supply chain is what the German industry should develop.",
            "Wendler noted that Framatome and Westinghouse subsidiaries in Germany have been involved in new build projects. The Olkiluoto-3 construction project in Finland was in effect run from Germany with Areva NP and Siemens as the main contractors, he said.",
            "Anglo-German-Dutch uranium enricher Urenco operates a plant in Gronau, northwest Germany, which accounts for about 17% of Europe’s uranium enrichment capacity. This places Germany among the few countries that have centrifuge technology, a fundamental pillar of the nuclear industry supply chain.",
            "One of the strengths of German industry is that it has a tight-knit network of companies and research institutions that can bring knowhow to all sorts of engineering and manufacturing problems.",
            "“The industry has been moving towards international markets in all areas, not just nuclear decommissioning, which itself has grown in importance and now is by far the most important {nuclear power} business within Germany,” Wendler said.",
            "“Many companies are seeking people to hire for a buildup in engineering and manufacturing capacities. This is due to a growing international market that has been energised by both the drive for political climate action and the geopolitical upheaval in consequence of the war in Ukraine.”",
            "",
            "In principle, said Wendler, there is a place for Germany in the development of new nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors, although “this will depend on which SMRs we are talking about”. ",
            "Traditional light-water reactor designs based on the general type that have operated in Germany for decades could be supplied and supported by German supply chains. This means German industry could potentially work well for the Westinghouse AP300 SMR, GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 and the SMR being developed by Rolls-Royce in the UK.",
            "“As for advanced reactors it is difficult to tell,” Wendler said. “I know that there are component manufacturers already developing parts or sub-systems for advanced reactors and the analytical and development capabilities available in Germany can be useful in this area.” ",
            "There are hopeful signals for the continuation of federal R&D funding for nuclear fusion. Earlier this month, Germany said it wants to build a “nuclear fusion ecosystem” made up of industry, startups and science so that a fusion power plant in the country becomes a reality as quickly as possible with a target of having a reactor in operation by 2040 – potentially making it among the first in Europe.",
            "“There is still room for improvement by broadening the range of government funded research topics,” Wendler said. “The German nuclear industry is prepared for this.”",
            "The cautiously bullish mood is helped by public opinion. Despite sometimes being against domestic large-scale nuclear, it always has been in favour of German owned or Germany-based companies developing and exporting nuclear technology, Wendler said.",

            "“Multilateral financing has not yet been used for national projects, so we as legislators need to be clear of the objectives and what methodology to use for it,” De Croo said. “The European Investment Bank (EIB) has to be technology agnostic,” he added.",
            "His remarks  about the EIB follow recent comments that the bank could be ready to finance nuclear construction if the circumstances are right.",
            "“Multilateral banks are effective when they provide leverage for private financing,” De Croo said.",
            "He added that “the more technically diverse you are the more stable you are”.",
            "“We need to adapt [small modular reactor] supply chains and balance things,” De Croo said.",
            "“We have the technology information to help SMRs, giving countries the necessary capacity for infrastructure, which is commercially neutral.”",
            "The Europeans want to continue to be open to the world and Egypt and Saudi Arabia are here, but it is not correct that the Arab world at large is not attending, De Croo said at NES. “Countries make their own energy choices,” he said.",
            "Pro-nuclear Hungary is the next EU presidency holder, said De Croo speaking on behalf of the current EU presiding country, Belgium. “I see respectfully choices that countries make.”",
            "So, “currently we are setting the agenda for the next [European] Commission to keep the heavy industry in Europe as it is moving away where the rules are less strict, but access to clean energy is the main factor,” according to De Croo.",
            "“We need a good [clean energy] mix, including nuclear,” he said.",
            "",
            "The IAEA is the global platform for nuclear and we need to make sure have a level playing field,” said Rafael Grossi, the agency’s director-general.",
            "“Cop28 was a watershed in that every country agreed that nuclear energy is part of the solution,” according to Grossi. ",
            "“However, we need to have a basic consensus around the idea that those who want nuclear should be helped in doing so.”",
            "He said the “US has done a bigger investment in nuclear fuel production to reduce dependence from Russian imports, Europe less, but let us not use this politically, as these are long-term infrastructure projects”.",
            "“We need to bear in mind that new builds are coming without any fuel from Russia,” he said.",
            "Grossi’s comments came in response to questions in the global nuclear power sector regrading a sufficient supply of nuclear fuel, following Cop28 commitments to triple nuclear power by 2050 from 400 GW to 1,200 GW.",
            "Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, which will follow Belgium as the next EU president, said during the summit that the continuation of political support for the industry in Europe was important, adding that “only nuclear can satisfy the requirements of generating big quantities of electricity cheaply and safely, and in an environmentally friendly manner”."

            "Urenco, the Anglo-German-Dutch provider of uranium enrichment services, has signed a new contract for the long-term supply of enrichment services with the operator of South Korea’s nuclear power plants.",
            "The company said in a statement that the agreement with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power company (KHNP) would help to provide a “secure, diverse and reliable supply” of nuclear fuel to South Korea, which has 26 nuclear plants in commercial operation and two under construction. ",
            "“The agreement with the KHNP, with whom Urenco has worked since 1993, will see us remain a major supplier for them well into the next decade,” Urenco said.",
            "KHNP’s president and chief executive officer Jooho Wang said KHNP is aiming to build a number of new nuclear power plants at home and abroad, and cooperation with reliable partners such as Urenco will be “very important as demand for nuclear power increases internationally”.",
            "In December 2023, Urenco approved an investment aimed at expanding the production capacity of its existing plant in Almelo, the Netherlands.",
            "According to Urenco, the expansion is a response to an expected long-term increase in customer demand as more countries and utilities turn to nuclear power for the first time or seek to extend and diversify fuel supplies for existing nuclear reactor fleets.",
            "The expansion marked the third investment under Urenco's capacity programme.",

            "European Commission president calls for discipline from sector and outlines key tasks ahead",
            "The future of the nuclear power industry is “hardly assured” and key tasks lie ahead if the sector is to make a substantial contribution to climate neutrality objectives, including the main one of securing new investments, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has said.",
            "In a speech to the inaugural Nuclear Energy Summit in Brussels in which she backed nuclear and outlined the role in can play in the energy transition, Von der Leyen said the reality today in most markets is “a slow but steady decline in nuclear’s market share”. ",
            "She said nuclear accounts for 9% of the world’s electricity mix, down from 18% in 1988. ",
            "In the EU, nuclear power is still the largest single source of electricity generation with a 22% share, she said, but that share is substantially below the levels reached in the 1990s, when nuclear power generated one-third of Europe's electricity. ",
            "“Key tasks lie ahead if nuclear is to make a substantial contribution to climate neutrality objectives,” Von der Leyen told the summit, co-hosted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Belgian prime minister Alexander de Croo,. ",
            "“The main one is to secure new investments. Support is needed from governments to ensure that financing is available and that nuclear’s contribution to electricity security is properly valued and remunerated.”",
            "Her comments came as world leaders at the summit adopted a declaration that promised efforts to unlock the full potential of nuclear energy including access to competitive financing for lifetime extensions, new nuclear plants and the early deployment of advanced reactors, including small modular reactors (SMRs) worldwide.",
            "",
            "IAEA director-general Rafael Grossi told NucNet at the 21 March summit that there is “a lot of work to do” with markets on financing.",
            "“We need to facilitate access to nuclear energy for those lagging behind, we have a lot of work to do on financing internationally and nationally,” he said.",
            "The IAEA has said that although they have relatively low and stable operating costs, nuclear power plant projects can be a challenge, considering that capital costs are high and usually combined with very large project sizes. This means that the scale of financing required for even a single project is substantial.",
            "The IAEA said the financing of nuclear power projects has become more challenging in the last three decades with nuclear operators exposed to price and demand risk, which increases the overall risk of new projects and the difficulty of obtaining financing. ",
            "“To encourage nuclear development despite these difficulties, innovative approaches to financing and support policies are being pursued, including partial investment or loan guarantees from the government,” the IAEA said.",
            "Von der Leyen called for discipline from the nuclear power industry, saying the future of nuclear depends on its ability to deliver on time and on budget. ",
            "“Far too often, the realisation of nuclear power plants has resulted in significant additional costs and overruns,” she said. ",
            "Another task is to look at new opportunities for nuclear such as providing decarbonised heat or clean hydrogen. These can help cut emissions from industry, which will be critical to reaching climate goals. ",
            "Von der Leyen backed life extensions for existing nuclear plants. She said countries need to consider their options carefully before they forego a readily available source of low emission electricity. ",
            "“The final task is to innovate,” Von der Leyen said. “Innovation in nuclear technologies is a very dynamic space, particularly for nuclear power technologies such as small modular reactors.”",
            "She said: “Small modular reactors are a promising technology and there is a race underway. The race is among leading countries and companies to prove this technology and bring it to the market.”",
            "",
            "According to Von der Leyen, more than 80 SMR projects around the world are moving forward and several EU member states have expressed a strong interest in SMRs. “So, let's go for it,” she said.",
            "Voon der Leyen told the summit “I am here because I believe that in countries that are open to the technology, nuclear technology can play an important role in the clean energy transition”. ",
            "She said that after the global energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, many countries are looking again at the potential role that nuclear might play. ",
            "This is because nuclear power worldwide is the second largest source of low-emission electricity after hydropower and to safeguard energy security, countries are looking to reduce their dependence on imported fossil fuels. ",
            "Nuclear also helps ensure competitiveness, Von der Leyen said. “Nuclear power can provide a reliable anchor for electricity prices.”",
            "This renewed interest comes at a pivotal moment. “Most pathways to net zero keep a place open for nuclear power,” she said. “And if I look at the International Energy Agency’s 2050 scenario, for example, nuclear power, nuclear capacity has more than to double till 2050, while renewables, of course, take the most of the work of decarbonising global electricity supply.”",
            "She said European Commission projections show that renewable energy sources complemented by nuclear energy will be the backbone of the EU power production by 2050.",

            "There is no alternative to deploying nuclear power for Poland’s future energy mix and to help secure baseload generation against intermittent renewables, Milosz Motyka undersecretary of state in the ministry of climate and the environment, told a panel discussion on Monday 18 March.",
            "“If not nuclear, then what? Not coal, there is no alternative,” Motyka told the Baltic Nuclear Energy Forum in the city of Gdansk, about 100 km southeast of Poland’s proposed first nuclear station at Lubiatowo-Kopalino on the Baltic coast.",
            "The cost of basing the Polish economy on coal-fired generation will be increasingly higher in the coming years and “it’s not worth it” for the economy and the environment, he said.  ",
            "Asked about renewable energy sources, Motyka said nuclear will secure the baseload of power generation and the stability of the energy system against the intermittent nature of wind and solar.",
            "“There is no alternative to the stability of the system like nuclear energy,” Motyka said.",
            "He said the government wants to update a 2020 nuclear energy programme by the end of this year – an update that will “strengthen the position of nuclear”, according to Motyka. The update is also expected to include progress on small modular reactors, according to earlier reports.",
            "In November 2022, Warsaw chose Westinghouse to supply its AP1000 pressurised water reactor technology for the country’s first nuclear power station, a three-unit facility at Lubiatowo-Kopalino in Pomerania, northern Poland.",

            "According to Bogdan Pilch, director of the Polish Chamber of Power Industry and Environmental Protection, equity financing may be a “wrong” option because it is “always the most expensive method” of financing.",
            "Pilch added that another related issue may be the loss of full control over the project, which better remain under the ownership of a single Polish company. Currently, this is project company Polskie Elektrownie Jadrowe, owned by the Polish state.",

            "A lot of EU funds cannot be used for nuclear, for instance the Just Transition Fund, which supports territories most affected by the transition towards climate neutrality and which could have acted like the US Project Phoenix fund, according to Desbazeille. Project Phoenix was launched in November 2022 to help coal reliant countries reduce the impact of climate change.",

The aim of the initiative is to provide standardised, pre-licensed designs supported by automated project development and design tools to enable customers to be ready to start construction on their SMR projects in the late 2020s.",
            "“We never saw such energy transition in society [to date]. We need many shifts in the system, so nuclear energy has to become a product”, Batra said.",

            "Project developer says first unit could be operating by 2030",
            "Canada-based Prodigy Clean Energy and Des Nëdhé Group have announced a memorandum of understanding to develop opportunities to power remote mines and off-grid communities in Canada using Prodigy microreactor transportable nuclear power plants (TNPPs).",
            "Under the MOU, project developer Prodigy and Des Nëdhé, an indigenous economic development corporation, will explore potential TNPP projects using microreactors including Westinghouse’s eVinci, a 5 MW unit that Westinghouse has said is the ideal technology for TNPPs.",
            "Earlier this year Prodigy said the first unit could be operating by in Canada by 2030.",
            "The Prodigy TNPP, which can integrate different types of microreactors, would be manufactured, outfitted, and partially commissioned in a shipyard, then transported to site for installation either on land or in a marine, shoreside setting. ",
            "The facility would require minimal site preparation when compared to a site-constructed small modular reactor (SMR). Since the TNPP would arrive at site more ready for final commissioning, power generation could begin in a matter of weeks. At the end of project life, the TNPP would be removed for decommissioning, eliminating legacy waste.",
            "Off-grid diesel replacement in Canada is a large opportunity, with most remote communities each requiring up to 5 MW, and remote mines from 15-45 MW. ",
            "Prodigy TNPPs would enable the deployment of microreactors safely and economically, even in hard-to-access locations such as those in the north of the country. ",
            "“Power generated would facilitate infrastructure improvements across the north, drive increased production of critical minerals, including those needed for transportation electrification, and increase opportunities for the long-term economic reconciliation of Indigenous Peoples,” a statement said.",
            "Prodigy is collaborating with Westinghouse to develop a TNPP outfitted with the Westinghouse eVinci microreactor, that would be suitable for these applications.",
            "Westinghouse and Prodigy signed an agreement in 2022 and have completed milestones for conceptual engineering and regulatory studies.",
            "Westinghouse said the next steps for the project include completing the TNPP design for the eVinci microreactor, completing development of a nuclear oversight model for TNPP manufacturing, outfitting and transport, and progressing licensing and site assessments to support a first project.",
            "Prodigy and Des Nëdhé also said they planned to engage with Indigenous Peoples across Canada to identify ways they could have ownership in TNPP new builds, and how an Indigenous workforce could take a leading role in TNPP commercialisation and infrastructure development.",

            "The Autoridad Regulatoria Nuclear (ARN) said the new licence would take Atucha-2, a 693-MW pressurised heavy water reactor (PHWR) unit that began commercial operation in May 2016, up to the end of its first 10 years of operation, a decade which has seen a number of licence extensions.",
            "In December 2015 ARN granted a conditional operating licence for Atucha-2, about 100 km northwest of Buenos Aires, until May 2016. It issued its initial five-year licence on 26 May 2016 following the completion of a programme of testing and training. ",
            "The first, two-year extension was granted in May 2021, but the unit was shut down from October 2022 for repairs after the discovery that one of the four internal supports of the reactor had detached.",
            "During a routine inspection, the plant’s warning system detected an obstruction in one of the fuel channels and it was discovered that one of the reactor’s four metal internal supports had fallen inside, together with its bolt. It was 14 meters deep, at the bottom of the reactor, the Buenos Aires Herald reported.",
            "The incident led to ARN issuing a second short-term extension to 26 May 2024, so Nucleoelectrica could resolve the problem. ARN authorised the unit’s restart in August 2023 following a 10-month shutdown.",

            "Global SMR project pipeline expands to 22 GW, increasing more than 65% since 2021 ",
            "Ahead of the first Nuclear Energy Summit (NES) in Brussels later this month, experts have looked at the challenges facing the commercialisation of small modular reactors in Europe and how to make new projects more competitive.",
            "“NES is a big and well attended event, so I am expecting that it will create political momentum and a lot of money will have to be mobilised,” said Yves Desbazeilles, director-general of the Brussels-based nucleareurope industry group at a webinar organised by the New Nuclear Watch Institute (NNWI) in London on 12 March.",
            "“The event wants to create momentum beyond Europe”, he said. “Building the equivalent of 100 GW to 120 GW of new installed nuclear capacity is required in Europe, and SMRs will take a significant share of that.”",
            "NES, on 21 March, will be co-chaired by the prime minister of Belgium Alexander De Croo and the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi. The IAEA said the summit will be the highest-level meeting to date exclusively focused on the topic of nuclear energy.",
            "NNWI chairman Tim Yeo told NucNet: “NES should aim to set a clear timetable for the expansion of nuclear energy capacity and commit to working to remove regulatory barriers to closer cooperation as quickly as possible.” ",
            "However, this global effort also demonstrates that Europe’s nuclear power industry and SMR deployment need to be better prepared for global competition.   ",
            "“The lack of available sites and project financing for first-of-a-kind are challenging, though their effects vary from one country to another as the UK, for example, has unwisely started a consultation about possible new sites for nuclear plants,” Yeo added.",
            "",
            "He said the consultation was a mistake because it will take years to reach a conclusion and the UK already has enough sites which are approved for nuclear construction.",
            "“Inviting proposals for new sites will make it much harder to develop the existing approved ones because objectors will argue that until all the possible alternative sites have been fully explored, none of the existing ones should be developed,” he said.",
            "The consequence of this unnecessary consultation is that no new SMRs will be built in the UK before at least half a dozen have been built elsewhere in Europe, according to Yeo.",
            "“Other countries are likely to avoid falling into this trap,” he added.",
            "“In those countries, a lack of project finance for first-of-a-kind SMRs may present a bigger challenge,” he said, noting that there is a real risk that the first SMR in Europe will not be deployed in the UK. Yeo cited as evidence comments to this effect by Rolls-Royce executives.",
            "Companies like France’s state utility and nuclear operator EDF have repeatedly called for SMRs to be developed as European rather than country specific projects, given the ongoing supply chain collaborations between Italy and France and beyond.",
            "“The creation of the European Industrial Alliance on SMRs opens up this possibility and it should be strongly encouraged,” said Yeo.",
            "“Potential supply chain companies may realise that Europe desperately needs to exploit first mover advantage to catch up with Russia, China and North America and see more benefits from cooperation than competition,” Yeo said.",
            "“It is essential that streamlining of the regulatory regime for new European SMR projects is in place as soon as possible to support deployment, thus helping to achieve [the EU’s and global] net zero targets,” according to Yeo.",
            "“The EIB’s [European Investment Bank] recent announcement to invest in nuclear power is very welcome and reflects a significant change of tack from the policy adopted by the outgoing EIB president”, Yeo said. “Active support for investment in nuclear will encourage private investors.”",
            "The NES should aim to set a clear timetable for the expansion of nuclear capacity and commit to working to remove regulatory barriers to closer cooperation as quickly as possible.",
            "",
            "A recent report by UK-based consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, SMR nuclear market update 2024, illustrates the scale of the effort needed for new investment as “the global nuclear SMR project pipeline expands to 22 GW, increasing more than 65% since 2021”.",
            "This expansion requires investment equivalent to $176bn (€160bn), while the uranium supply remains a challenge along with policy support, which is crucial to accelerating projects to final investment decisions, said the report.",
            "“While the sector has faced a range of challenges over the last 12 months, especially the cancellation of NuScale’s clean power project, multiple markets across the world are expanding their focus on nuclear SMRs,” said David Brown, director, energy transition service at Wood Mackenzie.",
            "Five countries, including the US, Poland, Canada, the UK and South Korea drive 58% of the risked project pipeline, according to the report.",
            "Some countries have introduced new policies that have spurred current activity, including the US, the UK and Japan, according to the report."

            "The Bulgarian government’s choice of South Korea’s Hyundai Engineering & Construction\r\n(Hyundai E&C) to build the proposed Kozloduy-7 and -8 AP1000 units is a well-thought-out decision, but a 15 April deadline imposed by the Bulgarian National Assembly on 26 February for starting negotiations on the contract seems too close, a nuclear power expert has said.     ",
            "“Hyundai E&C signed a partnership agreement with Westinghouse Electric Company in May 2022 and are looking to expand their cooperation in Europe,” said Milko Kovachev, Bulgaria’s energy minister from 2001-2005, and a former head of department at the International Atomic Energy Agency, speaking to NucNet on 28 February.",
            "Over the last 10 years, the South Koreans have been looking at opportunities to work in Europe in compliance with EU regulation, he said.  This means the choice made by the Bulgarian government to choose Hyundai E&C cannot come as a surprise. ",
            "“I personally look at it as a continuation of the previous relations between WEC [Westinghouse] and Hyundai E&C,” Kovachev said. “In addition, South Korean companies have a good record for project completion on time and on budget.”",
            "The invitation for expressions of interest for construction was specifically related to the construction of Kozloduy-7, as the first priority in new nuclear construction in the country, Rumen Radev, the Bulgarian energy minister, said in a statement 22 January. ",
            "“Bechtel [which unsuccessfully bid for the project] is WEC’s partner in countries like Poland, but US companies do agreements with no lump sum, fixed price contracts, while the Bulgarian authorities have specified that they want the Kozloduy-7 AP1000 to be completed in 60 months, and Kozloduy-8 in 54 months at a fixed price, a parameter that a US company does not normally sign,” Kovachev said. ",
            "“Meanwhile, South Korean companies offer this type of contractual commitment,” he said.  ",
            "In May 2022, Hyundai signed an agreement with Westinghouse to jointly participate in global AP1000 plant opportunities. The company was also part of a South Korean consortium that built four nuclear reactor units at the Barakah nuclear power station in the United Arab Emirates using South Korea’s APR1400 technology.",
            "Kovachev said that in this case, the Bulgarian client, Kozloduy New Build wants to ensure predictability and security, as the user’s point of view is to sell electricity at a competitive price. ",
            "In addition, last year the Bulgarian government has said that the price per block cannot exceed €6-6.5bn ($6.5-7bn).  ",
            "",
            "The financing of the construction of Kozloduy-7 is set to be primarily sourced from a few commercial banks, covering 70% of the project, with the Bulgarian government contributing the remaining 30%, according to Valentin Nikolov, the chief executive of the Kozloduy nuclear power station. ",
            "Following press reports earlier this week about the possibility of the European Investment Bank (EIB) backing nuclear power, an EIB spokesperson confirmed to NucNet on 28 February that “according to existing EIB rules, nuclear energy projects are eligible for EIB financing”.",
            "“In fact, we just supported a nuclear project in December last year with €145 million to facilitate the construction of Europe’s first tritium removal facility in Romania, thereby reducing radioactive waste and greatly enhancing health and safety,” the EIB spokesperson added. ",
            "Historically, the EIB has had a lending policy which is supportive to nuclear power, but it did not invest in it, as its shareholders, countries like Germany and France, have opposite opinions, Kovachev noted.",
            "“In recent press reports, the EIB spoke about funding SMRs [small modular reactors] only for now, but Bulgaria, Romania and the Czech Republic are interested to get financing for their NPPs, regardless of their reactor type choice,” said Kovachev.",
            "Kozloduy is Bulgaria’s only commercial nuclear power station. There are two 1,000-MW Russia-designed VVER units already in operation at the site and four older VVER units that have been permanently shut down. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Kozloduy’s two operating units provide about a third of the Bulgaria’s electricity generation."

            "South Korea wants to diversify its supply of enriched uranium",
            "South Korean nuclear power company Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and Centrus Energy Corp, a US-based nuclear fuel and services supplier, signed on 26 February a letter of intent in Washington DC to “to ensure stable nuclear fuel supply,” the two companies said in a statement.",
            "The letter of intent, “based on the memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed last April 2023” by the two companies “outlines substantive business objectives to enhance uranium resource security and nuclear cooperation between KHNP and Centrus”,the two companies said in the statement.",
            "Through the letter of intent, KHNP “aims to diversify the supply of enriched uranium used as nuclear fuel to enhance fuel supply stability. ",
            "Additionally, KHNP expects to strengthen nuclear cooperation between South Korea and the US by establishing strategic relationships with Centrus, which is working to re-establish a robust uranium enrichment capacity in the United States, the two companies added.",
            "Centrus noted in the statement that it is the only company in the US to have obtained a production licence from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission for high-assay low-enriched uranium (Haleu), which is used as fuel for many advanced reactors and small modular reactors (SMRs).",
            "In November 2023, Centrus succeeded in the initial production of 20 kg of Haleu at its facility in Piketon, Ohio, “demonstrating its technological and production capabilities for the US Department of Energy. ",
            "As a result of cooperation with Centrus, KHNP has opened the possibility of securing fuel for future reactors as well as for existing commercial reactors”, the two companies added in the statement.",
            "Through the signing of the letter of intent, the two companies will also “engage in concrete discussions regarding stable nuclear fuel supply and plan to continue exploring business opportunities in the nuclear sector by expanding the future nuclear fuel supply chain”, they also said in the statement."

            "Ministers says consenting and licensing of reactors must be speeded up",
            "The UK government exploring the potential for reducing regulatory burdens for the construction of new nuclear power stations as it pushes ahead with its ambition to deploy up to 24 GW of nuclear power by 2050. ",
            "Minister for nuclear Andrew Bowie told MPs on 27 February that the government wants to speed up the consenting and licensing of new nuclear power stations without impacting safety, security or environmental protections.",
            "“We are also looking to introduce a range of other streamlining measures, including the action plan for reform, which sets out reforms to the nationally significant infrastructure projects regime,” Bowie told a debate on new nuclear in parliament’s lower house, the House of Commons.",
            "Bowie was asked to confirm that land next to the Sellafield nuclear site in northwest England will be made available for new nuclear. Conservative MP Trudy Harrison, who represents the Sellafield area, said: “More specifically, will enough land be made available to accommodate two 470 MW Rolls-Royce power stations and their ancillary buildings and spaces?”",
            "In response, Bowie confirmed that the land, near Sellafield at Moorside, “is indeed a candidate for new nuclear” and it is one of a number of potential sites for hosting civil nuclear projects. ",
            "“Great British Nuclear is currently running a competitive process to select those small modular reactor technologies best able to facilitate operational projects in the 2030s. ",
            "“That said, the project needs to run its course, and I know [you] will understand that no decision on sites has yet been made.”",
            "Bowie also confirmed that the Oldbury nuclear site in southwest England is a candidate for new nuclear, and one of a number of potential sites that could host civil nuclear projects. ",
            "Bowie said economies of scale offered by SMRs are “one of the huge benefits, along with many others”. He said the government is running a selection programme and supporting exports from the UK and across the world so that other countries can “join us on our nuclear journey, investing in small modular, advanced modular and gigawatt-scale projects over the next few years”.",
            "In January the government announced what it called the biggest expansion of nuclear power for 70 years, with a nuclear roadmap setting out how the UK will quadruple nuclear power generation to up to 24 GW by 2050, up from about 5.8 GW today."

            "DESNZ expects to receive bids this month into SMR tender from shortlisted companies   ",
            "The UK government is planning to play a larger role in the country’s nuclear power industry in order to offset uncertainties in the energy market, Chris Heffer, the director of nuclear power at the country’s department of energy security and net zero (DESNZ), said at an industry event on 23 February.",
            "Heffer cited as evidence of this commitment the government’s investment of around €4.10bn (£3.50bn, $4.45bn) in the planned 3,260-MW Sizewell C nuclear plant in eastern England, the ongoing competition organized by DESNZ to select at least one small modular reactor (SMR) design for deployment in the UK by the early 2030s and investment through the government’s future nuclear enabling fund (FNEF) in enhancing fuel fabrication and uranium conversion capacity in the UK.",
            "Sizewell C is currently 51% owned by the UK government and 49% owned by French state nuclear power company EDF. The plant will comprise two 1.6-GW French EPR reactors and be built on a site adjacent to the existing 1,250-MW Sizewell B pressurised water reactor (PWR), the only PWR in the UK.  ",
            "Heffer said that “We expect a Final Investment Decision (FID) on Sizewell C by the end of this year,” adding that the country already had a “fuel manufacturing and production site in Springfields” outside Preston in northern England, owned by Westinghouse, where the government had already invested €15, 2 million (£13 million) from the FNEF to help develop uranium conversion capacity at the Springfields facility.",
            "Heffer added that the creation of the Great British Nuclear (GBN) government-owned entity to oversee the SMR competition and the government’s investment in Sizewell C demonstrate “a stronger role for the government in the UK nuclear sector. Energy security is also security for the UK.”",
            "He also said that “building a coherent system is the UK government approach [to the nuclear energy industry] rather than bits here and there.”",
            "He implied that currently the UK has got a system with bits here and there unlike the French one, but this is now changing. ",
            "Heffer also noted that high assay low enriched uranium (Haleu) would be an “important addition to the market and that there are some [important] commercial or technological decisions” to soon be made on Haleu.",
            "",
            "Speaking during the same event on 23 February, Guy Esnouf, GBN’s director of communications, said that GBN has a “role on the planning, regulations and siting” of SMRs in the UK, through its oversight of the SMR competition. ",
            "Esnouf also said that GBN was “putting the contract together” to select at least one SMR design for deployment in the UK, and that GBN would also “set up development companies” to establish and construct SMRs in the UK, using the designs selected in the competition. ",
            "He added that the UK government and GBN hoped that an FID would be made on the first SMR to be deployed in the UK by 2029. ",
            "“The key timeline is FID by the end of 2029, that is really important, this is urgent,” Esnouf said. ",
            "GBN is working on SMR siting “during the first half of 2024, we will look to find and purchase sites or the reactor developers will develop their own sites. We are looking at sites and are focused on areas with nuclear experience,” Esnouf noted. ",
            "GBN would “look to place at least one or two SMRs at sites” that it selected for deployment, but GBN and the UK government really “want to build a fleet of SMRs” according to Esnouf. ",
            "“We need to take advantage of modularity to get quicker and more reliable development” of SMRs, Esnouf also said. ",
            "“We need to learn how to build a fleet and need to go beyond one or two sites,” he added. ",
            "In the second half of last year, the UK government has selected six SMR companies to continue to the next phase of a competition to design and build small modular reactors.",
            "These companies include EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec Britain, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK. ",
            "The next bid expected, but not confirmed, as early as end of this month will secure the second round of the pre-selection process. ",
            "The DESNZ had said at the first selection round that the designs were “the most able to deliver operational SMRs by the mid-2030s”."

The technology is also under consideration at multiple other sites in Central and Eastern Europe, the United Kingdom, India and North America, Westinghouse said.",
            "In December 2022 the Dutch government chose the Borssele site as its preferred location for the proposed construction of two new nuclear power reactor units.",
            "The government said the units should be deployed by 2035, each have a capacity of between 1,000 MW and 1,650 MW, and use Generation III+ reactor technology.",
            "Energy minister Rob Jetten said in June the Netherlands was talking to “three potential and interested suppliers” to build two new nuclear power plants, according to Dutch news agency ANP.",
            "Reports in the Netherlands said the three were Westinghouse, the French state-owned company EDF and South Korea’s Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP).

            "The Spanish government’s plan to close all of the country’s seven nuclear reactors, starting with the closure of four units between 2027 and 2030, remains in place, but Ignacio Araluce, the president of Foro Nuclear, the country’s nuclear power association, told NucNet on 14 February that he would like to see the lives of the existing units extended to at least 50 years of operations.",
            "“We want to extend the existing seven units to 50 years as they all have level 1 WANO [World Association of Nuclear Operators] certification due to their excellent technology, meeting post-Fukushima standards”, he said.",
            "“The existing plants could work for another 30 years without much investment as every unit has been investing €30 million a year,” Araluce added. ",
            "This means that “by spending €200 million a year, all seven plants can continue for another 20-30 years and this is the cheapest option for Spain to sustain the country’s energy security, while reducing carbon emissions.”  ",
            "In 2023, Spanish reactors generated over 20% of the country’s electricity consumption, and managed to prevent around 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, according to Foro Nuclear data from January. ",
            "Thus, the Spanish reactors in operation have once again proven that they are essential to guarantee electricity supply by operating in a constant and stable manner, practically 90% of the hours of the year, Foro Nuclear said",

            "This is “difficult to continue, so we have had a battle on that with consecutive governments to reduce these taxes. And those taxes were on the top of the costs of the war In Ukraine”.",
            "The estimated cost of dismantling the seven reactors and managing long-term waste has risen to €20.2bn, from a 2022 estimate of €19.2bn.",

            "‘We are almost at the stage where a decision is to be taken,’ head of project company tells NucNet",
            "Ghana is aiming to choose a technology provider for a proposed first nuclear power station in 2024 and is already carrying out a series of studies at a preferred site, although financing remains a “major challenge”, Stephen Yamoah, executive director of the state-owned project company, told NucNet.",
            "Yamoah said Nuclear Power Ghana’s (NPG) preferred location for the West African country’s first nuclear plant is Atuapim/Nsuban, in the Western Region of the country, while a backup location is Obotan, in Central Region. NPG was set up in 2018 to be responsible for Ghana’s ambitious nuclear new-build project.",
            "Yamoah said preliminary studies have been carried out leading to the identification of the preferred and backup sites. However, detailed site studies are yet to carried out at Nsuban, a coastal location, including an environmental impact assessment, ecological studies, seismic studies, and geotechnical studies.",
            "In July 2022, the country’s president Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo approved the inclusion of nuclear technology in the country’s power generation mix and the country’s nuclear power programme.",
            "In 2021, Ghana issued a request for information (RFFI) to five reactor technology countries: US, Russia, South Korea, France, and China and received 15 responses comprising of six large reactor technology and nine SMR technology for the first new-build project.",
            "According to Yamoah, in 2023 Ghana issued a follow-up request for further information to five reactor technology vendors among the fifteen and invited them to Ghana for discussions and a tour of the preferred site.",
            "“All that was very fruitful. We are almost at the stage where a decision is to be taken,” said Yamoah.",
            "But he said financing for Ghana’s first nuclear plant remains a “major challenge”. ",
            "“If we are unable to find a way around the financing, then that is what is going to prolong the project.”",
            "Yamoah said Ghana is considering a number of financing methods. ",
            "Yamoah confirmed that initial offers received from “almost all” technology vendors included proposals on the financial aspects of the new-build project. ",
            "“Almost all of them [vendors] are proposing ‘EPC plus F’ [engineering, procurement, construction and financing] indicating what they can provide in the form of a loan, for example covering up to 85% of the project cost with Ghana providing the remaining 15%.”",
            "“A key influencer with respect to the final decision is going to be that of financing,” he said.",
            "Yamoah said Ghana is considering an alternative financing method using a public-private partnership with large industrial clients which would potentially consume electric power generated by the facility. Those industries include bauxite mining and aluminum processing. Nuclear could also be used for desalination and the production of clean hydrogen.",
            "A 2015 nuclear roadmap gave 2030 as a target date for deploying a pilot nuclear power station. Yamoah said a new target date is likely to be decided on after a technology vendor is chosen and initial planning work carried out.",
            "“Having a strategic partner is very critical for moving forward, and therefore, the longer it takes us to reach that decision, the further the project will go beyond 2030,” Yamoah said.",
            "Asked about the potential role of small modular reactors in Ghana, Yamoah said large units of 1,000 MW and above might bring challenges for Ghana’s grid.",
            "",
            " “We did an initial study with respect to our transmission system, and we need roughly about $800m to improve it in order for it to pick up a large reactor,” said Yamoah.",
            "There are over 80 SMRs designs under development, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Proponents say smaller reactor units could be more suited to frail African electricity grids.",
            "Political, geopolitical and bilateral relationship factors will also have an impact on a final decision, Yamoah said.",
            "He said the country should not drag its feet on taking a decision because the training of a specialised workforce will depend on the technology to be deployed. ",
            "“In terms of human capital capacity, there is a need to train more people. We have engineering universities, we have a research reactor, we have a postgraduate programmer in nuclear science and physics,” he said.",
            "“But the real training will depend on the technology that we’re going for. The moment we settle on the technology, there’s going to be a lot of mass training. For me, that is one of the reasons why a final decision must be taken fast.”",
            "Ghana wants nuclear power as a carbon-free, cost-effective and sustainable electricity source. The country currently relies mainly on hydro sources and natural gas, with some crude oil. It occasionally exports electricity to neighbouring countries.",
            "Reports have said that according to Ghana’s 2023 energy transition plan, nuclear is going to play a significant role in the country’s energy mix with close to a 40% of electric power in 2070."

Fermi Energia, which is developing and will operate the proposed plants, has said 2035 is a possible operational date after earlier saying it could be 2031.",
            "“We will need €73 million to create a [nuclear power] regulator, in addition to other ongoing costs,” according to Tooming. “Although the public and the political debate on nuclear has already started this year, the parliament will make a choice on whether to move on with the [nuclear] programme or not,” he added.",
            "“The next step would be the creation of a regulator if it gets parliamentary approval,” Tooming said.",
            "“In addition, we need to decide where the [SMR] technology will be placed and the regulator will then decide the circumstances as well as how technologies will fit into existing grid system,” said Tooming.",

            "The study selected deep geologic repository disposal as the best waste solution, but Estonia might also look at reprocessing, according to Tooming. The “polluter pays” principle will apply to the waste disposal programme and Estonia is looking at potential repository sites, he said.",
            "In terms of a safety regulator, “we already have an environmental agency with a safety department in Estonia, but need to develop this, while also passing a legislative act on nuclear energy [a nuclear law],” according to Tooming. "

            "Kallemets said “we need more construction coming into the nuclear space, not management consultants billing us, so we get advisory on construction, not on finance,” which will reduce the risks in funding first-of-a-kind SMRs.”",

            "She said the financial risk goes into being a first mover, so multiple users will have to come together to share the risk, but at a higher cost than we expected.”",
            "A US programme for high assay low enriched uranium, or Haleu, is available for advanced and modular reactor technologies, according to Caponity, so in the future the industry can safely make the leap to SMR deployment through efficient planning and maintaining investors trust. ",
            "Haleu uranium is enriched to between 5% and 20%, and is “required for most US advanced reactors to achieve smaller designs that get more power per unit of volume,” according to the US Department of Energy’s website.",
            "“Utilising expertise from decades before with advanced reactors is also a factor [in achieving successful SMR deployment globally], together with the launch of a €289 billion [$300 bn] loan facility within the [US] Department [of Energy] to help finance new nuclear power,” Caponity said.",
            "",
            "“For the first time we have incentives for new nuclear, as we do not have a clean energy [supply] requirement, but we do have a large number of customers and states that generate carbon free energy,” said John Kotek, senior vice-president of policy development and public affairs, at the Nuclear Energy Institute, speaking at the same Reuters event. ",
            "“Namely, 85% of utilities are served by customers, who want close to net zero energy,” Kotek added. ",
            "“That demand is showing up into the plans then they submit to the regulators of what their portfolios will look like”, he said. But added that US Congressional approval is “needed for nuclear exports.",

            "Lack of cost competitiveness ‘will have implications’ exports",
            " Countries in the preliminary stages of planning nuclear power projects will be likely to “double down their scrutiny” of small modular reactor offers following the cancellation of NuScale’s agreement with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (Uamps) for a Voygr SMR project in Idaho.",
            "Writing in his Neutron Bytes blog, nuclear energy analyst Dan Yurman said the lack of cost competitiveness of the NuScale Uamps project will have implications for US-based NuScale’s export opportunities for its Voygr technology in Romania, Poland, and Indonesia. ",
            "All three countries are price sensitive and are likely to closely assess offerings from NuScale and for every other developer of SMRs, for both light-water reactor and advanced designs, seeking export sales, Yurman wrote.",
            "“Other countries, like Estonia and the Philippines, which are in the preliminary stages of planning nuclear power projects, will also likely be doubling down their scrutiny of SMR offers. ",
            "“The key competition in all of these countries will come from the price of natural gas used to generate electricity and time to deliver a gas plant v. building an SMR.”",
            "Yurman said the Uamps project was heavily subsidised by the US government in the form of $1.35bn (€1.24bn) in cash to make the first-of-a-kind new build affordable. ",
            "“However, until global inflationary pressures abate, no commercial customer in the Philippines, Poland, or anywhere else is likely to commit to multi-billion-dollar capital expenditures for multiple SMRs without the host domestic government providing financial and rate guarantees for the project,” the blog said.",
            "He said unless the US commits to major levels of export financing for SMRs, like the levels of commitment South Korea and Japan have shown over the years for full size reactors, all US SMR developers will be at a financial disadvantage to Russia and China when they eventually bring their SMRs to market. ",

            "“NuScale should have sought as its first customer a utility with an operating nuclear reactor that would have a management team with the know-how to handle a new nuclear project.",
            "This “onsite strategy” would accrue significant cost savings with a switchyard and grid connection in place with a well-defined service area facing growing demand for power. Local and regional transportation networks, including rail, would have been available. Recruitment of skilled trades to build the plant and access to supply chains would be easier.",
            "Several other SMR developers are mindful of this issue. GE-Hitachi has plans to build multiple units of its BWRX-300 SMR at TVA’s Clinch River site in Tennessee and at OPG’s Darlington nuclear site in Canada. X-Energy announced its first advanced small modular reactor site near the Columbia nuclear power station in Washington state.",
            "NuScale, the first company with US approval for an SMR design, cancelled the Uamps project in November 2023. A statement at the time said it was unlikely the project would have enough subscription from power purchasers to continue towards deployment."

            "According to Vakkilainen, one of the strengths of the Finnish energy supply system is that electricity can be produced at relatively low cost – thanks to nuclear power. In 2022, the price of electricity was about half of the price level in countries such as Germany and Italy, he said.",

            "The nuclear power industry is seeing growing demand for a strategic European approach, including in the UK, to enable SMR projects at different stages of development to get off the ground.  ",
            "Anne Falchi, head of strategy, nuclear new build, at EDF said: “I believe in a European SMR, as Europe has the ambition of having 150 GW of capacity by 2050, so effectively we will need to build 120 GW of nuclear capacity in Europe by 2050.” ",
            "“EDF knows well the UK’s capabilities, therefore we will need to identify new UK sites, so these activities can be localised”, she added.  ",
            "“Great British Nuclear [GBN] is looking in the right direction in relation to UK SMR deployment, and EDF has the experience of working with around 100 UK companies,” according to Falchi. “Namely, GBN has a very clear roadmap within Europe for its SMRs,” she said. ",
            "",
            "“We need a lot of large nuclear reactors. I do not believe in a UK or a French supply chain, but a European supply chain, so the UK needs to figure out what it is best at”, she added. ",
            "“We have EU partners to bring together the best capabilities, so we are trying not to localise the supply chain. ",
            "EDF’s Nuward SMR subsidiary is looking to develop the Nuward SMR, consisting of two 170-MW SMRs combined to form a 340-MW SMR plant using two pressurised water reactors (PWRs). The Nuward design has been developed using France's extensive experience in PWRs. ",
            "Falchi said “EDF is looking forward to see an overall roadmap for nuclear power in the UK, so that the country can reach serial production of the same reactor.” Such a roadmap should also include information on the potential location of new units in the country, she added. ",
            "Realising the promise of SMRs is a priority, including the delivery, cost and use of UK made nuclear fuel, said Rory O'Neil, director of government affairs, Westinghouse UK. He added that “there will be a global supply chain” for SMRs.  ",

",
            "She said that maximising the ability to put nuclear power on the grid is key, as well as the need to work with a future system operator. A further priority is “the use of regulation and creation of a system for modularisation”, of new nuclear units, she added. “The nuclear roadmap, which is expected in January 2024, is built on specific points,” she said.

            "Renaud Crassous, Nuward’s president, has said in a press interview that the aim of the Nuward reactor design is to “fully integrate catalysts for success” of this SMR design, such as innovation, modularisation, standardisation and series production, thus speeding the start of the construction of the first SMR. ",
            "The French nuclear safety regulator, as well as the Czech and Finnish regulators, are now collaborating for a pilot European early joint regulatory review of the Nuward design. EDF is cooperating with Italian companies on SMR development to achieve a standard for the European market.  ",
            "EDF, which holds the majority ownership of the Italian energy company Edison, signed a letter of intent earlier this year with Italy's Ansaldo Energia, Ansaldo Nucleare and Edison to assess potential industrial cooperation for the development of nuclear power in Europe, especially SMRs.",
            "According to the French SMR roadmap, the detailed design and formal application for a first SMR is scheduled to begin in 2026, while the construction of the first unit is expected to take around three years after first concrete is laid in 2030. ",

            "State wants to use ‘amazing advancements in new nuclear energy technology’",
            "Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker has signed legislation lifting a three-decade moratorium on development of nuclear reactors in the state.",
            "Small modular reactors – usually defined as those producing less than 300 MW of power – will be allowed from the beginning January 2026.",
            "Sue Rezin, a Republic senator representing the 38th district in north-central Illinois and the proposal’s sponsor, argued that nuclear power is a critical part of the state’s renewable energy portfolio.",
            "“Illinois has a long, successful and safe history of nuclear energy generation,” Rezin said in a statement after the Democratic governor’s action, which she said “will ensure that our state can remain a leader in the energy sector by offering us the ability to utilise the amazing advancements in new nuclear energy technology”.",
            "A similar bill was vetoed by Pritzker in August, with the governor later explaining that while he supported the goal behind the legislation, the language used was “too vague” and would be used to construct conventional large-scale nuclear plants instead of being focused on SMRs.",
            "The new version of the bill includes other provisions to satisfy the governor, including assigning oversight of any new SMRs to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency in addition to the required federal controls.",
            "In 2021, Pritzker signed a law requiring Illinois to use only carbon-free electricity by 2045. The new legislation allowing the deployment of SMRs is part of the state’s strategy to meet those goals while accommodating expected increases in overall demand.",
            "“With the proliferation of EVs and other energy-consuming manufacturing processes we’re just going to be short on energy and we need to find a way to be able to procure it, but also make it carbon free,” said Illinois Representative Lance Yednock, the bill’s main House sponsor.",
            "Illinois has 11 reactors – more than any other state – at six nuclear power stations: Braidwood, Byron, Clinton, Dresden, LaSalle and Quad Cities.",
            "Last year, West Virginia’s governor signed into law legislation repealing that state’s nuclear construction ban, leaving only 12 out of 50 states with similar restrictions on the books, including Illinois.",
            "The 11 states with bans on nuclear are California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont."

            "Company seeing more longer-term contracting with parties seeking ‘reliable and sustainable’ partners",
            "The global climate crisis, the West’s renewed energy security needs in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the advancement of new nuclear technologies have been three main drivers behind “an increased momentum” to the enrichment market over the last 18 months, according to Sarah Forman, head of global strategy and corporate development at Urenco, a global enrichment services provider.",
            "Forman told an event organised by the European Nuclear Society and the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) in Brussels that a “renewed emphasis” on supply security has led to more “longer-term contracting with parties that are seen as reliable and sustainable”. In the past, Russian state-owned enterprises had been offering enrichment at prices that “were simply unsustainable in a Western context”, she said.",
            "In 2023, Urenco signed contracts in Ukraine and Bulgaria to provide enrichment services as part of the fuel manufacturing process for the Russia-designed reactor fleets of the two countries as part of efforts to support these countries to diversify their fuel supplies. ",
            "“And we’re expecting that to continue as countries are looking to increase energy security and independence and are relying more heavily on Western suppliers like ourselves,” Forman said.",
            "Forman said Urenco has been able to optimise how it uses its assets to generate more separative work from the same machines and in the future can re-optimise again to make up for a lack of conversion capacity in the fuel cycle to meet the upcoming requirements of the enrichment market.",
            "Urenco has also embarked on a significant capital investment programme to build more of the long and mid-term enrichment capacity across all of its sites that will be needed to support the industry in the medium and the long term, Forman said.",
            "Forman said: “We started engineering, design and other foundational work to be able to deliver whatever the market requires of us. We’ve begun an ambitious hiring programme and we have made new contracts with our centrifuge supplier.”",
            "",
            "In July, Urenco approved an investment to expand uranium enrichment capacity at its US site in New Mexico, known as UUSA – a move sparked largely by new commitments from US customers for non-Russian reactor fuel.",
            "The investment will allow an additional capacity of around 700 tonnes of SWU [separative work units] per year, a 15% increase at UUSA, with the first new cascades expected online in 2025 and the whole facility online in 2027.",
            "Forman said the company has the option on its license to expand its enrichment site in Almelo, the Netherlands, from last year’s 5.1 million SWU up to 6.2 million SWU in the future.",
            "According to Forman, Urenco is also supporting the evolution of the nuclear fuel cycle to supply the next generation of reactor technology, including advanced, micro, and small modular designs.",
            "In March, the company signed a contract to provide enriched uranium products for the US-based Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC) and its project to manufacture tri-structural isotropic (Triso) fuel particles in a planned joint venture with Framatome.",
            "Forman said the enriched uranium will be in the form of high-assay low-enriched uranium (Haleu), up to about 20%, or “low-enriched uranium plus”, which is about 5 to 10% enrichment level.",
            "Urenco is also planning a new facility to produce Haleu for the newest reactor designs, said Forman and added that efforts are focused on “developing a commercial scope of the new plant”, including questions around location and capacity and how it connects into existing infrastructure. ",
            "The 2022 annual report released by ESA last month found that 62% of enrichment services to EU utilities came from two EU-based companies, France’s Orano and Urenco, which is jointly owned by the British and Dutch Governments and two German utilities RWE and E.ON, and operates facilities in the Netherlands, Germany, the US, and the UK. The remaining services were provided by non-EU sources. Deliveries of separative work from Russia to EU utilities accounted for 30% of total deliveries.",
            "In the US, Biden administration officials have repeatedly expressed concerns about the country’s reliance on Russia-procured enrichment services which is claimed to have posed a “critical threat” to national security and % climate goals.",
            "At the Cop28 climate conference in Dubai this week, leaders from the US, Canada, France, Japan and the UK – a group of G7 nations informally known as the Sapporo 5 – announced plans to mobilise $4.2bn (€3.9bn) in government-led investments to develop a secure, reliable global nuclear energy supply chain.",
            "The investments will increase uranium enrichment and conversion capacity over the next three years and establish a resilient global uranium supply market free from Russian influence.",
            "The announcement follows this week’s pledge by 22 countries to triple nuclear energy capacity globally by 2050."

            "The findings come as 22 countries signed a pledge at Cop28 in Dubai to triple nuclear generation capacity by 2050 from a base year of 2020 at the UN’s Climate Change Conference in Dubai. This will involve inviting shareholders of international financial institutions to encourage the inclusion of nuclear energy in lending policies.",
            "Appleyard Lees partner and patent attorney, Richard Bray said that while patent filings for nuclear fusion and fission peaked in the 1970s and 80s – falling significantly through the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s – data from 2021 shows the start of a potential upward trend in filing activity not seen since 2000-2001.",
            "“It will be interesting to see if this trend continues… and which companies are leading this renewed period of innovation and patent filing. It is an exciting time for the nuclear industry as a whole.”",
            "According to the Fusion Industry Association, investment in the fusion sector has now reached over $6bn globally, with at least $4.2bn (€3.8bn) invested in the last two years. The single, largest investment in fusion energy was $1.8bn to US-based fusion reactor developer Commonwealth Fusion Systems, in 2022. Commonwealth Fusion Systems now has total declared funding of more than $2bn. ",
            "Appleyard Lees said many companies receiving recent investment are targeting fusion power to grid by 2030. ",
            "It said the stand-out area of fusion innovation, as shown by the patent data, is in magnets and magnetic properties, essential components in existing fusion reactor designs. Since 2018, there has been an increase in new patent filings for high temperature superconductors – potentially seen as game changing for numerous industries. Prime movers include UK-based Tokamak Energy, with two-thirds of its patent applications covering this type of technology, and the Korean Electrotechnology Research Institute, which tops the list with 11 patent filings in 2021. ",
            "Innovation in nuclear fission is most visible in small modular reactors. Patent filings relating to this technology jumped by 100% from 2019-2020 (from 19 to 38) and fell only marginally in 2021. ",
            "“While the previous innovation spike in SMRs is attributed to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear incident, the latest resurgence appears driven by interest in the microreactor concept, with offer smaller footprints than SMRs, and the capacity to produce up to 10 MW,” Appleyard Lees said.",
            "Notable patent filers in SMR and microreactors include large organisations such as Westinghouse, Korea Atomic Energy and Rolls-Royce. However, smaller companies – such as Nuscale and Terrapower, founded by Bill Gates – also appear in the list."

            "The goal of global net zero carbon emissions can only be reached by 2050 with swift, sustained and significant investment in nuclear energy, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a landmark statement supported by dozens of countries at Cop28 in Dubai today (1 December).",
            "The Vienna-based UN nuclear agency said in a statement announced by director-general Rafael Grossi that the world needs nuclear power to fight climate change and action should be taken to expand the use of this clean energy source and help build “a low-carbon bridge” to the future.",
            "It was the first time such an IAEA statement was issued, its broad international backing underlining increased global interest in nuclear power to tackle the “existential challenge of a rapidly warming planet”.",
            "The IAEA said the statement is a further indication of a new momentum for nuclear power as a source of reliable low-carbon energy, needed also to meet growing electricity demand and achieve sustainable economic development.",
            "Nuclear power has the potential to play a wider role in the quest towards net zero carbon emissions, the statement said. It can help to decarbonise district heating, desalination, industry processes and hydrogen production.",
            "According to the IAEA, nuclear power emits no greenhouse gasses when it is produced and contributes to energy security and the stability of the power grid, while facilitating the broader uptake of solar and wind power. ",
            "Locally, it cuts air pollution, which is one of today’s biggest public health crises causing the death of eight million people a year. ",
            "",
            "Innovative technologies, including small modular reactors, can make nuclear power easier to build, more flexible to deploy and more affordable, which is of particular importance to developing countries.",
            "The agency said that to “build a low-carbon bridge” to the future operating nuclear power plants should remain online. ",
            "Grossi said that “achieving a fair and enabling investment environment for new nuclear projects remains an uphill battle. We are not at a level playing field, yet, when it comes to financing nuclear projects.”",
            "“Analysts widely agree that nuclear power capacity will need to more than double by 2050 for current climate goals to be reached. We will need even more capacity to go beyond the electricity grid and decarbonise transport and industry,” he told the IAEA board of governors last month.",
            "According to the IAEA, 412 commercial nuclear power reactors operating in 31 countries make up more than 370 GW of installed capacity, providing almost 10% of the world’s total electricity and a quarter of its low-carbon supply. Several countries – including Bangladesh, Egypt and Turkey – are building their first nuclear power plants, while many others have also decided to introduce nuclear energy. Existing nuclear power countries, including China, France, India and Sweden, are planning to expand their nuclear programmes."

            "TerraPower, the nuclear reactor company founded by Bill Gates, and Texas-based uranium production and exploration company Uranium Energy Corp have signed a memorandum of understanding with the aim of reestablishing domestic supply chains of uranium fuel. ",
            "The companies said in a joint statement the MOU will allow TerraPower and UEC to explore the potential supply of uranium for TerraPower’s first-of-kind Natrium reactor and energy storage system.  ",
            "The Natrium demonstration project, being built in Kemmerer, Wyoming, will be a commercial scale plant and will begin operations within a decade.  ",
            "TerraPower and UEC have made significant investments in the nuclear fuel cycle and commercial scale deployment of clean energy projects that will directly benefit the US economy, the statement said.",
            "This includes providing support for establishing a robust US nuclear fuel supply chain for small modular reactors and advanced reactors and their high assay low enriched uranium (Haleu) requirements. ",
            "Haleu is an essential advanced nuclear fuel required for the development of most next-generation reactor designs. It is needed for 90% of advanced reactor designs selected for funding under the US Department of Energy’s advanced reactor demonstration programme.",
            "“SMRs and advanced reactors present the fastest growing segment of nuclear energy in the US and need a secure, domestic fuel supply chain,” the companies said. ",
            "“The first step of the supply chain is uranium, and UEC’s Wyoming resources have the critical mass to be a highly reliable source of uranium for American Haleu and a good strategic fit to supply TerraPower’s Natrium reactor.”",
            "Last year TerraPower bought land at the Kemmerer site, a retiring coal facility owned by utility PacifiCorp, where the first Natrium SMR will be deployed.",
            "Wyoming’s governor Mark Gordon said: “It makes no sense to depend on Russian uranium and enrichment technology, when a fully domestic fuel source can be found here in Wyoming and manufactured in the United States.”",
            "The Natrium technology is a 345-MW sodium-cooled fast reactor coupled with a molten salt-based energy storage system than can boost power output to 500-MW to serve peak demand. TerraPower says it is the ideal technology to pair with energy grids that have high penetrations of renewable resources. ",
            "UEC’s Wyoming production includes a portfolio of over 20 uranium projects that in total contain the largest compliant resource base in the US."

            "The ultimate aim is the global deployment of a lead-cooled fast reactor design developed by Westinghouse.",
            "Lead-cooled fast reactors have passive safety features and more efficient nuclear fuel use than other reactors. They reduce the amount of long-lived radioactive waste, the consortium said.",
            "Westinghouse says its lead-cooled fast reactor is a medium-sized, modular plant being developed to reduce front-end capital cost and generate flexible and cost-competitive electricity.",
            "Use of lead as coolant, with a boiling point exceeding 1,700°C, allows for high temperature operation without coolant boiling concerns.",
            "Commercial rollout will require extensive research and intensive testing. The consortium aims to begin with a small-size reactor to demonstrate the technological and engineering aspects of a commercial SMR. This test plant will be built at SCK CEN’s facility at Mol.",
            "In 2003 Belgium passed a nuclear phaseout law that requires all reactors to be shut down. The law was amended in 2013 and 2015 to provide for the three oldest reactors –Tihange-1, Doel-1 and Doel-2 – to remain operational until 2025.",

            "A common safety review framework would also offer transparency, ensuring that everyone is aware of what has been assessed and by whom. ",
            "This, in turn, would enable plant suppliers to understand the safety criteria they need to address and demonstrate to the authorities, especially during the concept design stage. This work would pinpoint disparities in safety requirements, providing tangible tools to foster their further harmonisation, Tiippana said. ",
            "Finland has five commercial nuclear plants, three at Olkiluoto and two at Loviisa. In 2022 nuclear made up a third of Finland’s total electricity generation, a figure that did not include Olkiluoto-3, which began commercial operation in May."

            "Overcoming potential challenges of ambitious reactor programme ‘is not impossible’",
            "The Swedish government’s plans for up to 10 new nuclear power plants reflect its recognition of the crucial role reactors can play in achieving energy security and climate targets, but after decades without any new build, legislation will be needed to reestablish supply chains and develop skills, the secretary general of the Swedish Atomic Forum (Safo) told NucNet.",
            "Dr Carl Berglöf said addressing the challenge of an ambitious new-build programme will also need legislation on financing mechanisms and collaboration between the government and the private sector to share the risks inherent in major infrastructure projects such as nuclear plants.",
            "He noted, however, that Sweden’s involvement in the formation of a European nuclear alliance signals its commitment to nuclear power. The alliance aims to advocate for nuclear energy at the EU level and secure support for its development. The government has also announced an inquiry into plans for new reactors.",
            "Dr Berglöf said overcoming potential challenges “is not impossible”. He said: “We made it before, so we will be able to do it again. ",
            "“And we have companies in Sweden today that are part of the international supply chain for Hinkley Point C and Olkiluoto-3 and other new build projects around the world. So we are not starting from zero.”",
            "",
            "He said Sweden has a well-developed supply chain for existing plants. But “if we want to build new nuclear power plants, we need to reestablish the supply chains. They will be international, of course, but we need to strengthen our national capabilities. ",
            "“That will be one thing and, of course, competence in general. People who can do all these things. Nuclear related competence is only a small part. We need civil construction competence and all the competencies that you need to build any infrastructure.”",
            "Dr Berglöf warned that the availability, however inconsistent, of “relatively cheap wind power”, complicates any discussion about the financing of nuclear new build. Wind power has seen significant growth in Sweden and accounts for around a quarter of all domestic energy consumption, he said.",
            "In a recent report, the Swedish National Audit Office warned of potential obstacles to new capacity, saying the government and the state authorities have not implemented efficient measures for the electricity system to develop in line with the overall goal of energy policy. “Delayed action, short-termism and poor impact analyzes are the biggest shortcomings,” the report said",
            "One of the issues Sweden faces is finding the right mix of large-scale nuclear power plants and small modular reactors, Dr Berglöf said. He said the two technologies are not in competition but would complement each other. ",
            "“It depends on the need,” Berglöf said. “If we look at the system at large, there is a big need of electricity and of course there is a role for large nuclear in this. ",
            "“SMRs – which can be deployed in groups to maximise their cost-effectiveness – can have more flexible applications like clean hydrogen production and industrial heat or water desalination. I think those applications will be key for the transition.” ",
            "Dr Berglöf said mining, with its energy-intensive operations, has been identified as a potential application for SMRs with reactors able to provide reliable power for operations, especially in remote locations. ",
            "The production of clean hydrogen for fossil-free steel production could also be powered by nuclear, wind, hydro, or a combination of these energy sources.",
            "Swedes have debated nuclear energy for decades, but the power source has garnered popular support recently amid the ongoing global crunch. Demand for electricity is poised to soar in coming decades as everything from heavy industry to transportation will rely on power instead of fossil fuels.",
            "However, Sweden’s plans to resume the construction of nuclear power plants are the result of “a wakeup call” that stretches further back than the war in Ukraine and was the result of extreme weather in 2018 that raised questions about the country’s energy mix and its dependence on wind and hydroelectric power, Dr Berglöf said.",
            "Nuclear energy, with its steady and reliable output, began to appear more often in discussions around the subject. ",
            "“It became very clear and obvious that we cannot rely only on wind and hydro. In Sweden, we also need nuclear because, with such a long period without wind, it’s going to be difficult.”",
            "But the “real breakthrough” in the debate around nuclear came in national elections in 2018 when the Christian Democrats ran on a platform that strongly advocated for the building of new reactors. ",
            "",
            "The party’s position attracted “a surprising amount of popular support”, helping it – unexpectedly – reach its best electoral performance in 12 years, finishing well above the 4% threshold for representation in parliament. ",
            "In the 2022 election, party leader Ebba Busch led the Christian Democrats into an alliance that won the most seats. Busch said after the election that new nuclear reactors would be built.",
            "This pro-nuclear success at the ballot box attracted attention and, during the 2019 elections for the European Parliament, Sweden’s Moderate Party, with nearly a quarter of the seats in Sweden’s government, took up the nuclear cause. ",
            "The prime minister and Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson has made expanding nuclear power generation a key goal for his right-wing government, seeking to reverse a process of gradual closures of several reactors in the past couple of decades that has left the country relying more heavily on renewable but sometimes less predictable energy.",
            "He announced earlier this year that Sweden is preparing legislation to allow the construction of more nuclear power stations.",
            "“We have an obvious need for more electricity production in Sweden,” Kristersson said.",
            "“What we are doing today is changing legislation to allow for the construction of more nuclear reactors at more places.”",
            "Dr Berglöf said: “Serious reevaluation of Sweden’s energy stance and political backing have been aligning in favour of nuclear energy.”",
            "Minister for climate and the environment Romina Pourmokhtari recently announced an inquiry into new nuclear."

            "The US state department and the Slovak economy ministry hosted the launch event and inaugural Project Phoenix workshop in Bratislava.  ",
            "The launch event included participants from more than 15 countries in the Europe and Eurasia region and marked the start of cooperation among the US and the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia on feasibility studies to explore conversion of coal plants to “safe and secure new nuclear energy”.  ",
            "The US state department said Project Phoenix is a demonstration of the US commitment to support partner countries in meeting their energy security and climate goals while maintaining the global nonproliferation regime.",
            "US special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry announced Project Phoenix at the Cop27 UN Climate Change Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt and later announced that the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia would be the first three awardees. ",
            "At the time, Kerry said Project Phoenix would provide direct US support for coal-to-SMR feasibility studies and related activities in support of energy security goals for countries in Central and Eastern Europe.",
            "The state department said Project Phoenix’s feasibility studies and technical assistance seek to accelerate the global clean energy transition away from fossil fuels and to retain local jobs.",
            "In many cases, small modular reactors are ideally suited for coal plant conversions as they provide 24/7 baseload energy, can be scaled as needed to meet energy needs, and require relatively little land area, which allows them to be built on existing sites, the state department said.  ",
            "SMRs can be used for clean power generation, district heating, hydrogen production, industrial applications, and water desalination in water stressed regions.",
            "The US-based Electric Power Research Institute said earlier this month\r\nthat existing coal plants can provide key benefits and opportunities that make them “a compelling option” for the deployment of nuclear generation, but prominent issues around perceived risk and nuclear waste management need to be resolved."

            "Law firm has announced investigation of potential claims on behalf of shareholders",
            "A “misleading” research report about US small modular reactor developer NuScale Power has “no basis in fact” and should litigation begin based on the report NuScale will “vigorously defend itself”, the company told NucNet.",
            "Portland, Oregon-based NuScale said the report, published by Iceberg Research on 19 October, contains inaccurate and deceptive “research” that is riddled with speculative statements with no basis in fact and demonstrates a limited understanding of SMRs and the nuclear power industry. ",
            "The company, owned by Fluor Corporation and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, said factually inaccurate statements include and are not limited to NuScale’s former chief financial officer’s equity holdings and NuScale’s sources of income, which are principally revenues from customers. ",
            "NuScale cautioned investors “not to rely on this baseless and self-interested attack designed solely to drive down the company’s stock price”.",
            "On 23 October, Rosen Law Firm, an investor rights law firm, announced an investigation of potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of NuScale Power Corporation resulting from “allegations that NuScale may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public”.",

            "One of the central claims made by Iceberg Research and Rosen Law Firm is that a NuScale contract with blockchain data centre service provider Standard Power “has zero chance of being executed as Standard Power clearly does not have the means to support contracts of this size”. ",
            "NuScale said Standard Power conducted a comprehensive review of baseload, reliable and secure power sources that are the most critical component for operating data centres in the AI-sector. ",

            "Three industry leaders give an inside view of what is needed to get a new generation of nuclear power plants online",
            "The US National Academies said in a recent report that the world confronts “an existential challenge” in responding to climate change, resulting in an urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors of the economy. It asked: “What will it take for new and advanced nuclear reactors to play a role in decarbonisation?”",
            "Advanced reactors encompass a wide range of technologies, including next generation water-cooled reactors, non-water-cooled reactors such as lead or sodium fast reactors, and fusion reactors, which aim to replicate the processes that power the Sun.",
            "Some advanced reactor concepts are relatively new, while others have been under consideration for decades and used in research, test, and prototype reactors around the world. ",
            "Reactors using any of these technologies that have electric generating capacity of 300 MW or below are classified as small modular reactors (SMRs) by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). They can be factory-built and transported for onsite assembly, allowing for greater flexibility and faster production.",
            "According to a recent survey, support for advanced nuclear is high and most are not put off by perceptions – real or not – of cost, safety or waste issues.",
            "However, there are challenges that must be overcome. We hear from three industry voices about the challenges for deployment.",
            "The British government needs to overcome hesitancy in the advanced reactor sector by sending a clear signal that it is in favour of using nuclear for industrial decarbonisation, Hill said.",
            "The NIA is championing advanced nuclear through conversations with government, investors and companies in the sector, and is determined to see deployment of advanced reactors in the UK during the early 2030s.",
            "But he said demand for advanced nuclear is an obstacle with no formal signal that the UK wants to deploy a large amount of advanced nuclear. “That creates a hesitancy in the market,” he said.",
            "Hill sees a lack of awareness of “the full potential of advanced nuclear” as responsible. He said the potential for advanced nuclear in industry is overlooked, and called on the government to “send a demand signal… for advanced nuclear for industrial decarbonisation.”",
            "For advanced reactors to realise their potential for onsite power generation, Hill said it is critical that these reactors would be “smaller in scale, closer to industry”, and make use of old gas and coal stations.",
            "Hill said eight new sites considered by the government as suitable for nuclear development are not nearly enough, with many of them already spoken for. The sites are Bradwell, Hartlepool, Heysham, Hinkley Point, Oldbury, Sizewell, Sellafield and Wylfa.",
            "“We need a new approach”, said Hill, “That menu-based siting policy won’t work to deploy advanced nuclear.” ",
            "The NIA is calling for a siting policy based on exclusionary criteria rather than “a narrow list of specified patches of land”.",
            "Renaud Crassous, chief executive of France’s Nuward small modular reactor project, said that for SMRs to succeed, they need to leverage “economies of series” through the standardisation of factory production, simpler onsite assembly, and faster learning via repetition.",
            "He called for “some kind of equivalence” in regulations across countries. “If you have to redesign the products when you move to another country, you will have a lot of difficulties,” he said.",
            "Nuward, an EDF subsidiary, is developing the Nuward SMR, a Generation III pressurised water reactor (PWR) that Crassous hopes will be “better than coal and gas”. Nuward is hoping to start construction of a demonstrator plant as early as 2030.",
            "Whilst large reactors have reduced their costs through economies of scale, SMRs lose this advantage and must instead leverage ‘economies of series’, argues Crassous. The idea is that SMRs may see reduced costs through the standardisation of factory production, simpler on-site assembly, and faster learning via repetition.",
            "He acknowledged there are doubts about economies of series, “We still need to demonstrate it is possible… It’s a classic chicken and egg dilemma.” He said “a perspective for series” is required and “we should prepare to deploy not one or two, but dozens of SMRs.”",
            "He said the lack of history in SMR deployment is a risk for investors, but one that might be mitigated by a lower upfront investment per unit when compared with conventional nuclear plants.",
            "Transparency with stakeholders about “the stage of design… state of the technology, and supply chain bottlenecks” will be crucial to ensure the economic success of the Nuward project, Crassous said.",
            "In Denmark, a country that has never had a commercial nuclear power plant, the private company Seaborg is developing an SMR that will be housed on floating barges, a concept which the company says “leverages the shipbuilding industry’s long-standing construction expertise”, allowing for faster and cheaper construction and deployment, and a more standardised licensing process. ",
            "Navid Samandari, the company’s co-founder and chief executive officer, anticipates deployment of Seaborg’s first reactor by the end of the decade, with a larger commercial rollout expected in the early to mid-thirties.",
            "But he also flagged regulation as an area that needs to be addressed, saying a lack of advanced reactor knowledge in the regulatory community is the primary challenge for deployment and warning that “if this gap is not closed quickly, it could prolong the time to market… and prevent deployment.”",
            "Samandari said that “most regulators’ budgets probably don’t reflect the massive increase in interest [in SMRs that] we have seen.” Governments need to increase resources available to regulators, “otherwise it could potentially become a bottleneck in the not-so-distant future”.",
            "Seaborg is engaging early with regulators to avoid “unpleasant surprises”. Trust in Seaborg’s partners , who include Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power and Samsung Heavy Industries, will help them optimise deployment, said Samandari, citing their “knowledge and experience with maritime and nuclear regulations.”",
            "Despite public concerns about nuclear energy, Samandari said Seaborg expects “positive societal acceptance” owing to the inherent safety of its reactor. Like many advanced reactors, Seaborg’s is being developed to rely more on passive and inherent safety features\r\nthan conventional systems. This means they can automatically correct or mitigate risks that would otherwise require external input from an operator to manage.",

The companies had said that Uamps members or other utilities needed to commit to buying 80% of the project’s power for it to be feasible. NuScale has agreed to pay Uamps a termination fee of $49.8m (€46.5m).",
            "“The customer made it clear we needed to reach 80%, and that was just not achievable,” NuScale chief executive officer John Hopkins said on a conference call Wednesday. “Once you’re on a dead horse, you dismount quickly. That’s where we are here.”",

            "Existing coal plants can provide key benefits and opportunities that make them “a compelling option” for the deployment of nuclear generation, but prominent issues around perceived risk and nuclear waste management need to be resolved, a report concludes.",
            "The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) report, From Coal to Nuclear: A Practical Guide for Developing Nuclear Energy Facilities in Coal Plant Communities, says repurposing a coal plant’s infrastructure could be an option to help sustain coal communities while providing a carbon-free source of generation through nuclear power. ",
            "It outlines the process for determining if locations are suitable for development, factors to consider when selecting the reactor type, and regulatory considerations including water and transmission rights.",
            "From a technical perspective, issues such as perceived risk and nuclear waste management can be overcome, and many advanced reactor designs address these concerns, the report says. But “it is something that must be understood and evaluated when making the business decision to deploy nuclear”.",
            "“Since coal communities have had experience with power generation, this shared experience can be a good point for the owner-operator and local stakeholders to start a conversation,” the report says.",
            "Power plant closures can adversely impact local communities that benefit from the facility through jobs and tax revenue. Until recently, newly constructed natural gas-fired power units often replaced decommissioned coal plants, but governments are encouraging the redevelopment of the sites for other forms of low- or zero-carbon power generation.",
            "According to the report, nuclear power is key to bringing emissions targets within reach for many countries. With the retirement of more coal plants, redeveloping these sites to deploy new nuclear generation could be the next step in the clean energy transformation. ",
            "Since 2000, more than 90 GW of US coal units have been retired, driven in large part by efforts to meet decarbonisation goals. By 2050, coal plants across 2,400 sites in 79 countries are expected to retire, representing 1,000 GW.",
            "There are several advantages to repowering an existing coal site for new generation, including existing transmission infrastructure and interconnection permits that may be able to be reused, modified, or extended. Many such sites have access to well-developed transportation infrastructure and existing utility connections for buildings. Existing environmental permits for a coal facility may be modifiable.",

In the US, the right to withdraw water is under more scrutiny, and there are reputational and permitting advantages to modifying existing water withdrawal and discharge permits rather than undergoing the permitting process in a new area. ",
            "In its key findings, the report says water, land and transmission availability are the greatest resources available from an existing coal plant for the development and deployment of a nuclear plant.  It says reuse of infrastructure, such as the balance of plant or the turbine cycle of the coal plant, should include a thorough review of all technical aspects of the system, structures, and components to make sure they meet all technical and licensing requirements for nuclear deployment. ",
            "A March 2023 report by the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center thinktank said nearly one-fourth of the current US coal-fired fleet is scheduled to retire by 2029, providing opportunities to use existing infrastructure for small modular reactors and reduce construction costs by 17% to 35%, ",
            "The report said there are a number of challenges to address. Coal plant retirement and SMR operation dates must be aligned for a smooth workforce transition and to prevent existing transmission and water infrastructure from being used by another project.",

            "European Union member states should sign a peace pact as part of a “grand bargain” on nuclear energy that would end internal conflict around the role of nuclear in the net zero- transition, the US-based Atlantic Council thinktank has said.",
            "In a report on EU nuclear energy policy the council says the pact should take the form of a political neutrality agreement on nuclear energy that affirms that each state is free to choose its own energy mix and affirms there is no right to block member states wishing to launch, expand or conserve their nuclear capacity.",
            "All this would come in exchange for further integration of electricity markets and agreement on its reform, higher renewable targets and renewed work and research on the management of nuclear waste. ",
            "“Member states, principally Germany, should respect individual decisions to develop their energy mix as they see fit, as long as emission reductions are reached,” the report says. “Member states, principally France, also need to drop their hostility to the deeper integration of European electricity markets.”",

            "The report says the acrimony over nuclear has come at a terrible time for the EU, when it urgently needs to decouple from weaponised Russian energy supplies and decarbonise due to the worsening climate emergency.",
            "European policymakers are fiercely deliberating the future of nuclear energy, but Germany and France are divided on the question of whether nuclear, as a stable source of low-carbon energy, is crucial to Europe’s energy transformation or “a dangerous blocking point” that diverts funding from renewable energy deployment. ",
            "Nuclear energy is critically important to Europe, the report says. According to International Atomic Energy Agency data there are 100 nuclear power reactors in operation in Europe (with another nine in the UK), producing about a quarter of electricity generation in the bloc and nearly half of all carbon-free electricity in the EU.

Hungary is expanding its Paks nuclear power station and Romania is planning new units at Cernavodă. At least 25 new nuclear reactors are planned in other member states, including six in Poland and two in the Netherlands. ",
            "Italy, which shut its nuclear reactors down after Chernobyl, making it the only G8 country without its own nuclear power plants up until Germany’s own closures, has launched a government initiative to consider reintroducing nuclear power.",

            "Nuclear energy can help address supply shortages and assist with grid stability. According to the report, when paired with renewables, nuclear brings down the costs of the energy transition, notably in terms of infrastructure. There is further potential regarding the adoption of small modular reactors."

            "The Wylfa land is owned by Hitachi, which acquired it in 2012 but withdrew from plans to build new nuclear there in 2020 due to funding issues.",
            "Sunak told BBC Wales he was committed to nuclear power in general because it is an important part of how we deliver energy security in the UK, but also how we decarbonise over time to get to net zero but in a proportionate and pragmatic way”.",

            "Country’s first station to have three AP1000 units on Baltic coast",
            "Polskie Elektrownie Jadrowe (PEJ) signed an engineering services contract on Wednesday (27 September) with a consortium between US-based companies Westinghouse Electric and Bechtel for the construction of Poland’s first nuclear power station in Pomerania.",
            "State-owned PEJ said in a statement that the contract will cover the preparation of the plant design and engineering documentation for the project which will ultimately see the construction of three AP1000 pressurised water reactor units on Poland’s Baltic coast.",
            "These will include the main components of the power plant like the nuclear island, the turbine island, the associated installations and auxiliary equipment, as well as administrative buildings and infrastructure related to the safety of the facility. ",
            "Westinghouse confirmed the contract scope includes finalising a site-specific design for three AP1000 nuclear islands.",
            "The primary objective of the conceptual design and engineering work is to define the requirements and criteria, and to specify the norms and standards to be used during the new-build project, PEJ said.",
            "The contract will take 18 months to complete, said PEJ, and will also focus on cooperation in obtaining further permits, including a construction permit. It will also serve as a basis for another contract which will address the construction phase of the project.",
            "According to PEJ, the engineering contract with the Westinghouse-Bechtel consortium will allow for the design of supply chains for the nuclear power plant in a way that maximises local industrial content in Poland and Pomerania specifically.",
            "",
            "Earlier this month, Westinghouse and Bechtel announced they had signed a formal agreement to partner on the design and construction of the station.",
            "In November 2022, Warsaw chose Westinghouse to supply its AP1000 reactor technology for a three-unit nuclear power station at the Lubiatowo-Kopalino site in Pomerania, northern Poland.",
            "“We are entering a watershed moment not only for our investment project, but also for the entire energy transition process in Poland,” said Mateusz Berger, president of the board of PEJ. ",
            "“Today's event concludes the planning stage of the nuclear power plant and commences the execution phase with relevant engineering work,” he said.",
            "Poland’s environment agency issued last week an environmental permit for the new-build project, paving the way for the construction permitting process. A siting procedure is still under way with local authorities in Pomerania.",
            "Nuclear new-build plans are a central part of Poland’s drive to fundamentally realign its energy sector by 2040 and meet climate targets by phasing out coal-fired power generation, which provides nearly 80% of the country’s electricity today.",
            "According to Westinghouse, the AP1000 is the only operating Generation III+ reactor with fully passive safety systems, modular construction design and the smallest footprint per MW on the market.",
            "In the US, one AP1000 unit is commercially operational at the Vogtle site in Georgia, while a second unit recently completed its initial fuel load with commercial operations likely later this year or early 2024.",
            "There are four AP1000 reactors in commercial operation at Sanmen and Haiyang in China.",
            "Poland’s first unit is expected to come online in 2033, with first concrete slated for 2026 – a deadline still considered “realistic”, according to recent government statements. The Vogtle units in the US took about 10 years to bring online."

In the longer term, more than 30 countries increase their use of nuclear power in a scenario called the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario, which proposes a pathway for the energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 and play its part, as the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, in limiting global warming to 1.5°C.",
            "The report says that to achieve the overall doubling of nuclear capacity by 2050, an average of 26 GW of new capacity comes online every year from 2023 to 2050 in the NZE scenario, some of which is needed to offset retirements. ",
            "This calls for average annual investment of over $100bn (€94bn), which is triple the level in recent years. ",
            "Following the completion of projects already underway, the peak of expansion comes in the 2030s, when an annual average of 33 GW of new nuclear capacity comes online, marking a new high for the nuclear industry, the report says.",
            "In the NZE scenario, China leads the way in nuclear power expansion, accounting for one-third of all new nuclear capacity to 2050, with other emerging market and developing economies accounting for almost another one-third. ",
            "",
            "In advanced economies, where reactors have been in operation on average for over 35 years, nuclear capacity additions rise over time largely to offset the retirement of existing reactors, though lifetime extensions continue to play an indispensable role as part of a cost-effective approach to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. ",
            "All regions increasingly draw on advanced nuclear technologies, including new Generation II+ and IV large reactor designs and small modular reactors. While the biggest opportunity for nuclear power is in the electricity sector, new nuclear power in this scenario helps to decarbonise heat and to supply low-emissions hydrogen.",
            "IEA executive director Fatih Birol said the prospects of the world staying within the 1.5°C limit on global heating have brightened owing to the “staggering” growth of renewable energy and green investment in the past two years.",
            "But Birol also noted that greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector were “still stubbornly high”, and that the extreme weather seen around the world this year had shown the climate was already changing “at frightening speed”.",
            "The report found “almost all countries must move forward their targeted net zero dates”, which for most developed countries are 2050 – though some have closer dates, such as Germany with 2045 and Austria and Iceland with 2040 – and for many developing countries are much later, at 2060 in the case of China, and 2070 in India’s case.",
            "Cop28, the UN climate summit to be held in Dubai this November and December, offered a key opportunity for countries to set out tougher emissions-cutting plans, Birol said."

            "Policy ‘at crossroads’ with question of financing central to country’s ambitious new-build plans, Lords told",
            "The start button on the project to build new nuclear power plants at Sizewell C in southeast England is about to be pressed, but up-to-date assessments of likely capital costs and completion dates are needed first, a debate in the House of Lords was told.",
            "Lord Howell of Guildford, a Conservative, told the upper house of the UK’s parliament that the EPR technology planned for Sizewell C “has a most unfortunate history” in construction timing, costs and reliable operation. ",
            "He said the EPR at Olkiluoto-3 in Finland took 20 years to complete and is many billions over budget. At Flamanville-3 in France they are running 11 years late. “It is still not ready and is also €10 billion over budget,” Lord Howell said.",
            "According to Lord Howell, the central question regarding new nuclear in the UK is one of finance. He said: “The last estimate for Sizewell C – the only one we have at the moment – was £20 billion. ",
            "“From Hinkley and other previous experiences, we know it is bound to be much nearer £30 billion.”",
            "He said the present hope is that a funding scheme which has already been used elsewhere can somehow be mobilised. It is called the regulated asset base (RAB), which in effect makes would-be consumers start paying their energy bills from the day the scheme is launched, before a single kilowatt of electricity is produced. ",
            "Lord Howell said that “on the figures we have, the government will still need to put in about £6 billion, over and above the £1 billion or so already publicly committed. ",
            "“We hope that Électricité de France may come up with the same amount. ",
            "",
            "“Some £100 million has already been set aside to buy out the Chinese interest in both Sizewell C and an all-new Chinese plant at Bradwell-on-Sea which was once promised as part of a deal with China in times gone past when relations were happier. ",
            "“We thought then that they should take a major role in our nuclear progress, which we do not think any longer.”",
            "Lord Howell said the question is whether smaller and newer reactors should be “the absolute spearhead” UK priority, as other countries are making it, or whether “the giant EPR replica, which remains the centrepiece of British nuclear policy, continues to be there, as appears to be the situation”. ",
            "He said: “Japan, America, Russia, France, China, South Korea, Canada, Germany, Argentina, Australia and Finland are a few of the countries giving priority attention to these new designs.”",
            "Lord Howell said the UK’s national policy on nuclear power development is at a crossroads. ",
            "He said: “One route would mean pushing ahead with the mega-nuclear giant projects as now at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and as planned at the so-called replica, where a repeat is planned of Hinkley C, at Sizewell C in Suffolk. ",
            "“Experience tells us – it certainly tells me – that that will take 10 or 15 years to complete. We have been at this point many times in the past 30 or 40 years.”",
            "The other route is to recognise that those giants have had their day and that instead “we should concentrate resources and skills on smaller modular reactors, designed at a time of revolution in nuclear power technology worldwide – and which, it is claimed, can be built much more quickly and sooner and are much more attractive to private investors for that very reason.”",
            "",
            "The UK government has set out plans to generate up to a quarter of the country’s electricity from nuclear by 2050. ",
            "The Conservative Lord Mott told the Lords: “To achieve this, we remain committed to the full spectrum of nuclear technologies, from traditional large-scale reactor projects through to exploring more innovative small, advanced and even microreactor designs. ",
            "“That is also why we have launched Great British Nuclear, to ensure we have the right structures in place to help deliver the nuclear programme,” he said.",
            "He said GBN’s first priority is to identify the SMR technologies best able to deliver a final investment decision by the end of 2029 and deliver projects in the mid-2030s, potentially releasing multi-billions of pounds of private and public investment to build SMR technologies on sites. ",
            "Lord West of Spithead, a Labour peer, said nuclear power is the only guaranteed carbon-neutral power source that can operate day and night, whatever the weather.",
            "But he warned: “How our nation, which at one stage led the world in civil nuclear power, is now reliant on Chinese, Japanese, French and American expertise is a national disgrace. ",
            "“I will not go into that now, but it is appalling when you think that we led the world. ",
            "This needs to be turned around and we need to generate the scientists, engineers and designers to ensure that we are never again in this position.”",

            "Advantages ‘stretch way beyond zero-carbon operations’",
            "Nuclear energy has the potential to be “a disruptor” for the marine industry, transforming not only vessel operations but entire supply chainsand the “ship-to-port interface” by providing electricity to land-based or port-related marine services, an industry leader said.",
            "Christopher Wiernicki, chairman and chief executive of classification society the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), said in an article published in TradeWinds, that when it comes to propulsion, the third and fourth generations of nuclear reactors hold much promise for shipping and the advantages stretch way beyond zero-carbon operations.",
            "He said ABS studies suggest vessels fitted with small modular reactors may offer faster design speeds, advanced cargo systems or processes, and reverse-cold-ironing services, where electricity can be provided to land-based or port-related marine services. ",
            "Cold ironing allows emergency equipment, refrigeration, cooling, heating, lighting and other equipment to receive continuous electrical power while the ship loads or unloads its cargo.",
            "Wiernicki said the reactor and supporting systems on a vessel may well be smaller than existing engine dimensions and weight, especially when considering the reduction of onboard fuel storage, potentially increasing cargo capacity.",
            "“Vessels fitted with advanced reactors could provide energy for the entire lifespan of an asset, reducing time in port and eliminating bunkering and other costs,” he said.",
            "“For all its potential, there remains much additional research to be completed,” Wiernicki said. ",
            "“Putting nuclear energy on commercial vessels – a mobile environment frequently in harsh sea conditions and varying geographies and jurisdictions – requires further development and demonstration with an unwavering focus on safety and environmental sustainability.",
            "“Advanced reactors pose quite different safety, security, and waste issues than legacy reactors, but many details still need to be addressed, including regulatory frameworks, permitting, operating constraints and public acceptance.”",
            "An ABS study earlier this year showed that the adoption of advanced nuclear reactors onboard a large containership would eliminate the need for refuelling of the vessel during its entire 25-year lifespan. ",
            "Wiernicki said the study showed why the industry cannot afford to ignore the vast potential offered by nuclear propulsion both in terms of emissions reduction and operational efficiency."

            "Pritzker said his veto was not a rejection of the goal behind the bill, but was due to concerns about its language. ",
            "“The problem is the bill was written in such a way that you literally couldn’t cross out words to make it do what it should have done and what it was originally intended to do, which is to make small modular reactors available for use in the state of Illinois,” Pritzker said. ",
            "He said that while SMRs show promise, they are not yet ready for widespread use.",
            "Pritzker suggested that the swift passage of the bill in general assembly might have resulted from a lack of scrutiny of a late amendment to the legislation, which mandated that any new power reactor in Illinois must be an “advanced reactor” as defined in federal law.",
            "Pritzker said he was confident his veto would not be challenged in the general assembly. ",
            "Sue Rezin, original sponsor of the bill, called for a vote to override the governor’s decision. As a member of the minority party in the state government, her move is unlikely to succeed.  ",
            "Illinois has 11 reactors – more than any other state – at six nuclear power stations: Braidwood, Byron, Clinton, Dresden, LaSalle and Quad Cities.",
            "Last year West Virginia’s governor signed into law legislation repealing that state’s nuclear construction ban, leaving only 12 out of 50 states with similar restrictions on the books.",
            "The American Nuclear Society said that list, in addition to Illinois, consists of California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont."

            "Tokayev made the announcement during a regular address to the nation. He said that during the 2019 election campaign he promised that decisions on the most important issues for the country would be made through referendums",
            "The president said the proposed construction of Kazakhstan’s first nuclear station, likely to be in the southeast of the country, is one such “extremely important” issue warranting a referendum. A date will be announced at a later stage, he said.",
            "Tokayev said Kazakhstan should develop its own nuclear generation because it is the world’s largest uranium producer, but “on the other hand, some express concerns over the safety of nuclear plants”.",
            "He said there are experts who are also in favour of building small modular reactor plants. ",

            "New generation of nuclear plants can play ‘significant role’ in replacing fossil fuels",
            "Europe needs to show a firm commitment to the development of small modular reactors as the bloc seeks to meet its goal of climate neutrality by 2050, a draft European Parliament committee report says.",
            "The report, prepared for the committee on industry, research and energy, says SMRs represent a promising way for the EU to achieve its energy and climate objectives and offer “considerable opportunities” in terms of electricity production, industrial heat, hydrogen generation and district heating, a draft European Parliament committee report says.",
            "It calls on the European Council to demonstrate a firm commitment to contributing to the successful development of SMRs in the EU and warns that the bloc could be left behind if it does not commit itself to the global race for leadership in the future SMR market.",
            "The report underlines the need for a comprehensive strategy for the deployment of SMRs in the EU and stresses the need for an annual report by the European Commission assessing progress in the development of SMRs.",
            "It says SMRs offer a lower initial capital investment, greater scalability and siting flexibility for locations unable to accommodate more traditional larger reactors. They now have the potential for enhanced safety and security compared to earlier designs.",
            "No SMRs have been commercially operated, but more than 80 SMR designs are at different stages of development and deployment in 18 countries. ",
            "The EU has committed to reducing achieving climate neutrality by 2050 and SMRs “have the potential to play a significant role in replacing fossil fuels”, the report concludes.",
            "The main challenge of SMR deployment is the uncertainty coming from the fact that designs are not yet at the advanced stage of maturity.",
            "The scientific community still needs to test and prove the expected advantages. This affects the risk perception and limits the potential size of the market. ",
            "Another challenge would be establishment of a robust supply chain.",
            "The report also says that to maximise the economic advantage of SMRs, it would be crucial to establish an almost global market for one design of reactor to be manufactured via mass production. ",
            "“That would require higher levels of regulatory harmonisation and market consolidation than exist at present.”"

            "A government vision to increase the UK’s nuclear power is more of a “wish list” than a detailed strategy, according to a parliamentary report.",
            "The Science, Innovation and Technology Committee said in a 110-page report published on Monday (31 July) that the government is right to look to nuclear power to meet the country’s future electricity needs and that this requires a substantial programme of nuclear new build.",
            "But the committee warned that government hopes of building a new nuclear power plant every year lack the comprehensive detail and strategy needed to meet such ambitions – particularly those around funding and skills.",
            "The committee said the government target of 24 GW of nuclear generating capacity by 2050 – up from around 5.8 GW today – and the aspiration to deploy a new plant every year are more of a “wish list” than the comprehensive detailed and specific strategy that is required to ensure such capacity is built.",
            "",
            "The strategy should include a clearer role for the government body Great British Nuclear (GBN) beyond its task of selecting small, modular reactor developers and more clarity over the country’s future mix of generation including SMRs, large-scale plants and advanced reactors.",
            "“The government’s stated aim of 24 GW of nuclear capacity is ambitious: it is almost double the highest installed nuclear capacity the UK has ever achieved,” the committee said. ",
            "“It could involve new gigawatt-scale nuclear power, small modular reactors and advanced modular reactors (AMRs), and further development of nuclear fusion. It would require substantial progress on technologies, financing, skills, regulation, decommissioning and waste management.”",
            "There are also concerns over the government’s funding arrangements, with the committee pushing the government to clarify the projected costs for taxpayers before signing contracts for new gigawatt-scale nuclear plants.",
            "The government is trying to attract private investors through a regulatory asset base (RAB) financing mechanism that shares the risk of construction costs with the public. However, the RAB model has considerable downside, leaving consumers unfairly exposed, the committee said.",
            "“The consumer or taxpayer is taking an unknown and uncertain risk of cost overruns, yet disburses funds from day one without earning a return,” the committee said. ",
            "“The choice to proceed with gigawatt-scale nuclear power should not be made without robust estimates of its value for money, including the financial value of the construction risk being assumed by taxpayers or billpayers.”",

            "“Witness after witness who appeared before our inquiry told us that such a strategic plan for nuclear is missing,” Clark wrote. “For example, there is no indication from the government on what proportion of the 24 GW is intended to be met by gigawatt-scale plants like Hinkley Point C, or smaller, more distributed nuclear reactors such as small modular reactors.

            "The UK government has confirmed plans to provide £170m (€197m, $218m) funding to support the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk, southeast England, backed by fresh measures aimed at speeding up preparations for the flagship nuclear power project.",
            "The funding, which follows the official launch of the government body Great British Nuclear (GBN) last week, is being earmarked to further prepare the project’s construction site, secure essential components from its supply chain, and facilitate a larger workforce, according to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.",
            "At the peak of construction, it is estimated that the project to build two Generation III+ EPR nuclear plants developed by France’s EDF could support around 10,000 jobs nationwide, with supply chain plans for 70% of the value of construction contracts set to go to UK businesses, it said.",
            "The government last year agreed to invest £700m to take a 50% stake in Sizewell C, which EDF has said it expects to cost around £20bn in total.",
            "The UK’s nuclear power capacity has been dwindling over the past several decades. In recent years the UK has generated about 15% of its power from its fleet of commercial nuclear power plants, but most are being retired this decade, with the last one – Sizewell B – due to close in 2035.",

            "EDF said the project would both help to provide reliable, low-carbon power to the equivalent of six million homes over 60 years, while avoiding some nine million tonnes of CO2 emissions each year compared to using fossil fuel energy.",
            "By setting out clearer support for Britain's nuclear industry, the government said it hoped to attract further private investment into UK projects, alongside its planned introduction of the “tried and tested” regulated asset base (RAB) model for nuclear, and the inclusion of nuclear in the UK’s green taxonomy.",
            "Under the previous mechanism to support new nuclear projects – the contracts for difference (CfD) scheme – developers had to finance the entire construction cost of a nuclear project up front, and only began receiving revenue when the station starts generating electricity. ",
            "This model led to the cancellation of potential projects, such as Hitachi’s project at Wylfa Newydd in Wales and Toshiba’s at Moorside in Cumbria.",
            "Under the RAB scheme, private investors receive greater certainty through a lower and more reliable rate of return in the early stages of a project, lowering the cost of financing it, and ultimately helping reduce consumer electricity bills.",

            "Energy security secretary Grant Shapps said the UK is planning a massive revival of nuclear power.",
            "“Sizewell C represents the bridge between the ongoing construction of Hinkley Point C and our longer-term ambition to provide up to a quarter of the UK’s electricity from homegrown nuclear energy by 2050,” Shapps said.",
            "“Our new nuclear fleet will provide clean, reliable, and abundant energy whilst driving down bills, boosting economic growth and ensure that the UK is never held to energy ransom by tyrants like Putin.”",
            "Nuclear and networks minister Andrew Bowie said that, with government support, Britain’s nuclear industry would be able to play a critical role in supplying cleaner, home-grown energy, and boost energy security by reducing reliance on fossil fuels from abroad.",
            "“The steps we’re taking today will speed up the development of one of our biggest projects, Sizewell C, towards final approval, which would enable construction to start as soon as possible, supporting thousands of jobs for communities in Suffolk and across the country,” he said.",

            "‘We need a broad portfolio of energy technologies’",
            "Danish nuclear company Seaborg has signed a letter of intent with Bergen, Norway-based energy company Norsk Kjernekraft to investigate the possibility of establishing Seaborg's Generation IV compact molten salt reactor (CMSR) technology in Norway. ",
            "Seaborg said it has made significant progress in the development and commercialisation of its technology, including agreements on the construction of power plants and fuel development in Asia. ",
            "Seaborg said Norsk Kjernekraft, which aims to build, own and operate small modular nuclear power plants in Norway, will participate in this development, with the goal of introducing the technology in Norway.",
            "Initially, Norsk Kjernekraft will establish small modular reactors based on conventional technology, “in order to relieve the increasingly demanding energy situation as quickly as possible”, Seaborg said. ",
            "In the longer term, Norsk Kjernekraft is looking to Seaborg’s advanced technology, particularly with respect to industries that are difficult to decarbonise. ",
            "Norsk Kjernekraft chief executive officer and chairman Jonny Hesthammer said Norway needs a broad portfolio of energy technologies. “The technology of our Danish partners will play a significant role here, and there are numerous indications that Seaborg’s technology will come sooner than many had imagined,” he said.",
            "In a CMSR reactor, the fuel is mixed with molten fluoride salt, which also acts as a coolant. According to Seaborg, this provides significant safety benefits.",
            "The company intends to mount its innovative reactor on what it describes as “power barges”.",
            "Seaborg said it is aiming to produce a commercial prototype by 2028 and serial production in the 2030s.",
            "The first power barges will have two reactors installed delivering 200 MW. The modular design allows for up to 800 MW over a 24-year lifetime, the company has said."

            "Grossi told the agency’s nuclear harmonisation and standardisation initiative’s (NHSI) plenary meeting that policymakers and the public are turning to nuclear energy to mitigate climate change, ensure energy security and deliver a just, reliable, affordable and timely transition to net zero. ",
            "He said the nuclear sector is not only growing, it’s also changing – it is becoming much more global. “We must step up as international organisations, regulators, policymakers and industry,” Grossi said.",
            "He said the benefits of harmonising regulatory environments and standardising industrial approaches “are clear to everyone” and include reduced uncertainty for major nuclear projects, helping to lower the cost of building and deploying a new generation of small modular reactors (SMRs) and ensuring SMRs across the world meet the highest safety and security standards, reducing the risk of accidents and the consequences of malicious acts, whether those reactors are deployed in Sweden or Ghana. ",
            "“This is particularly important given that they may be deployed in remote areas,” Grossi said.",
            "Harmonised regulations will ease international trade of SMRs and components as developers design and manufacture reactors that comply with a more uniform set of global standards rather than having to deal with multiple, sometimes conflicting, sets of requirements in different countries.",
            "",
            "Harmonised approaches help newcomer countries and those countries with less experience, fewer resources and a smaller pool of the necessary talent. It allows them more easily to collaborate with others and implement the highest standards of safety and security, Grossi said.  ",
            "He said: “With higher interest rates to deal with and inflation pushing up the cost of steel, copper wire and just about everything else that goes into building an SMR, we know that even the most promising projects are having to tell their investors and buyers that prices have risen substantially. ",
            "“Avoiding, or at least mitigating, cost rises and delays is now even more crucial.”",
            "The IAEA said the NHSI is the first truly global effort with wide international backing. It brings together key stakeholders, including regulators and industry, to talk to each other and provide feedback on each other’s efforts.",
            "The agency said harmonised approaches and requirements could help streamline research and development efforts across different countries, promoting collaboration and knowledge-sharing and avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts.",
            "Grossi’s call for increased harmonisation was backed by Rolls-Royce SMR’s safety and regulatory affairs director, Helena Perry, who said the UK company’s SMR design is progressing well through the UK’s independent regulatory assessment – a process which is internationally recognised and respected.",
            "“We’re keen to work with the IAEA on this important initiative and explore opportunities to streamline the safe and secure deployment of SMRs around the globe. Rolls-Royce SMR is working with a range of developers, utilities and industrial customers, and we believe that there are real opportunities to capitalise on the progress we’re making in the UK to streamline the process elsewhere in the world.”",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR has said its first SMR would cost about £2.5bn (€2.9bn), although the company has argued the cost of each plant will drop to £2bn once it has a pipeline of orders."

            "Desbazeille told the Nucleareurope 2023 annual conference in Lyon on Wednesday that nuclear energy should continue to provide about a quarter of European Union electricity by 2050, a task which will require the deployment of about 115 GW of new nuclear.",
            "He said of the 150 GW needed to retain nuclear’s share in the EU electricity mix in 2050, the long-term operation (LTO) of existing nuclear reactor fleets could provide just about 35 GW.",
            "According to Desbazeille, LTO is expected to meet around 23% of the target, new large-scale reactor would account for 37%, small modular reactors for 33%, and advanced modular reactors for 7%.",
            "Agnès Pannier-Runacher, France’s minister of energy transition, told the gathering in Lyon that Europe’s nuclear sector is expected to represent more than €500bn ($544.4bn) of GDP and more than a million jobs in the next decade.",
            "“There is a will to position nuclear at the forefront of our European energy policies, but we need to transform it into a strong vivid, European common, and global project”, she said.",
            "Pannier-Runacher called on the European nuclear sector to “work together” in order to improve performance, share operational, supply chain, and safety expertise with the goal to deliver “competitiveness and affordability.”",
            "“I hope that together we can build a more resilient European supply chain,” said the minister. “This is a long journey. It implies being independent from Russia and any other country.”",
            "In May, Pannier-Runacher headed a meeting of 16 European countries as part of a “nuclear alliance” that said Europe needed to support new reactors and renewables if it wants to decarbonise its economy. A next informal meeting of the group is scheduled for July.",
            "Over the last months, the France-led group has challenged\r\na couple of EU-level policies over the role of nuclear power. Those included a new version of the bloc’s Renewable Energy Directive touching on 2030 targets and an overarching Net-Zero Industry Act aiming to boost the competitiveness of the EU’s strategic and sustainable sectors.",
            "“Nuclear is a European industry in its own right, as well an enabler for other industries,” said Yves Desbazeille and added that the Net-Zero Industry Act is one policy which “would benefit from a more technology neutral and consistent approach” with respect to nuclear energy.",
            "In March, a proposal by the European Commission excluded nuclear power from the EU’s “strategic” low-carbon industries only carving out space for advanced Generation IV technologies and small modular reactors, none of which are commercially deployable today.",
            "“The supply chain is also key,” said Desbazeille. “By building up a European supply chain we can ensure that we have access to what we need, thus potentially reducing project delays.”",
            "Xavier Ursat, president of French nuclear industry group Gifen, said that to build a stronger nuclear industry, the French supply chain should build partnerships with its peers from other European countries.",

            "Experts planning to launch multilateral body that could help deployment of plants ‘at unprecedented pace’",
            "Existing financing mechanisms for nuclear energy are tailor-made and not reliable enough to enable a global expansion of nuclear power capacities. In a relatively short period of time, massive amounts of capital will be required for the multiple hundreds of gigawatts of nuclear power capacity globally to meet the world’s ambitious net-zero and sustainability goals, according to a team of international experts calling for the creation of a new multilateral bank to support nuclear new-build.",
            "A proposed International Bank for Nuclear Infrastructure (IBNI) would serve as a multilateral bank that would facilitate the mobilisation of the trillions of dollars of private and public capital into the nuclear sector over the next decades, providing financing, support and expertise to help scale up nuclear power at “a rapid and unprecedented pace”, said Daniel Dean, former investment banker and chairman of the advisory board preparing the project, based in Vienna.",
            "Dean told NucNet that global financial markets are not investing and lending in the nuclear sector as they are in nearly every other asset class. The goal of IBNI will be to work with governments and market actors across project lifecycles to meet the bankability and investability requirements of global financial markets. Helping projects define their conditions for economic equilibrium early on will build investor confidence and enable the “serialisation of repeatable and successful nuclear projects delivered on time and within budget under a similar set of standards across borders,” said Dean.",
            "“For example, IBNI would help drive the nuclear sector toward a de-risked profile where an IBNI-qualified nuclear sector financing would look very similar to any other investment class a pension or insurance fund would readily put their money in today,” he said.",
            "“The bank would progressively make that happen [de-risking] with the appropriate frameworks, transaction structures, standards and criteria. IBNI would enable the increasing crowding-in of cost-efficient market and commercial capital into the nuclear space and enable the demonstration of investable projects that are repeatable and successful across borders. ",
            "This is the key to developing market confidence in the nuclear sector, and IBNI would serve in the role as that patient and long-term capital provider and leader that will be ideally situated to enable confidence.”",
            "Multilateral banks are chartered and partly financed by a coalition of countries with similarly aligned long-term global policy goals, such as the rebuilding of Eastern European market economies (EBRD) or eradication of poverty (the World Bank). IBNI’s mission will be far simpler, to help nuclear energy fulfil its needed role as a clean, secure, safe and affordable source of energy in order to attain 2050 net zero goals in a sustainable manner, said Dean",
            "IBNI would need to be set up by a multinational treaty signed amongst its member countries pulling financial resources together to support the rapid scaling of the nuclear sector.",
            "“Unlike the World Bank for example, IBNI will be an infrastructure bank focused solely on nuclear power. It would provide financing and support to economically advanced through developing countries,” said Milton Caplan, IBNI’s advisory board representative from Canada.",
            "",
            "According to Caplan, many financial institutions eye nuclear projects with distrust because of factors like project scale, complexity, large capital needs and recent records of delays and cost overruns.",
            "“Many of these financial institutions start off somewhat negative on nuclear projects and one needs to work hard to just to pull them to neutral,” said Caplan. “So, just think about if you had a bank which started understanding that nuclear can be a good investment, and then had the expertise to assess each project on its own merits?”",
            "One typical role of a multilateral financing institution is in conducting a policy dialogue early in the process of preparing large projects, said Milko Kovachev, former infrastructure section head at the International Atomic Energy Agency and IBNI advisory board member in Bulgaria.",
            "“For most cases this is not covered by any existing institutions today when it comes to nuclear power,” said Kovachev, “IBNI will be there to take on that challenge.”",
            "IBNI would be capitalised through a combination of member country governmental, financial markets and private resources. It will have two major financing conduits – a commercial operations arm which would require an estimated $50bn (€46.6bn) of initial government shareholder capital and a separate donor-funded operations arm.",
            "Of the $50bn, approximately $25bn would need to be paid up-front allocated from some 30 shareholder member countries, while the donor fund would require an estimated $5bn of government capital from a subset of seven or more member countries.  ",
            "David Stearns, a UK-based bank financier on the IBNI advisory board, said the idea behind the bank is not to duplicate or replace state guarantees and other forms of pre-existing support in nuclear projects, but to effectively optimise the financing-related elements of a nuclear project.",
            "“The idea of IBNI is that we maximise public sector value for money with a triple bottom line. First, IBNI must be non-loss-making in order to be sustainable. Second, IBNI must provide additionality, focusing on bridging the gaps between public and private capital. Third, IBNI will crowd in private investment through its quality label and the trust financiers can put in the Bank,” said Stearns. “The bank needs to keep an AAA credit rating, which means it will be an extremely conservative bank, actually.”",
            "IBNI planning documents show that the bank will be aiming to provide both early and long-term financing and support to projects including technology-, country and vendor-neutral new-build, operating life extensions and reactor restarts, nuclear fuel cycle, decommissioning and restructuring of existing projects.  The bank will finance and support production and supply chain projects as well as nuclear infrastructure.",
            "Early-stage and mature projects, programmes and industries would be supported by IBNI through a combination of both donor and commercial funding, including financing programmes ranging from competitive grants, concessionary and commercial financing guarantees, climate and sustainability impact financing and equity stake participation. ",
            "",
            "IBNI is also planning to support emerging advanced and modular reactor, fusion and Generation IV technologies, through their commercialsation and scaling, by making available a combination of both donor and commercial operations programmes. ",
            "Kovachev said IBNI can be the institution to cover the serial or fleet deployment of small modular reactors, projects which have long lead times. “No institution is supporting serial deployment of this scale at the moment, and IBNI can come as the missing link in that niche,” he said.",
            "The concept of IBNI was born in 2021 out of discussions with parties including many Intentional Atomic Energy Agency member states which are trying to develop new nuclear programmes and developed states trying to finance nuclear projects and most efficiently scale up their nuclear sectors. ",
            "The immediate pathway forward includes the establishment of a non-governmental advisory organisation (NGO) that would guide governments and other key stakeholders on the optimal ‘best international practices’ in respect to the near-term implementation of the bank.",
            "It is envisaged that a coalition of about 30 to 50 member countries will come together to establish the bank, said the IBNI team. The NGO is expected to be set up this summer, and will take an additional 18 to 24 months to establish and operationalise the bank.",
            "A key initial milestone to be facilitated by the NGO will be to bring a core group of countries together to sign a joint declaration or memorandum of understanding prior to the COP 28 cliamte conference in Dubai in December. Such announcement could ideally be made during COP 28 as the conference can be the global ‘launching pad forum’ to bring together a larger coalition of supportive countries, said Daniel Dean."

            "Single plant scheduled for extended operation until 2036",
            "Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan has confirmed that his country’s single nuclear power plant, Armenian-2, will be shut down in 2036, but affirmed his support for negotiations to find a partner to build new nuclear units.",
            "In an address to the Armenian parliament, Pashinyan said negotiations are underway with several partners, including from Russia and the US, on the construction of a new nuclear power plant to replace capacity that will be lost from the closure of the 416 MW Armenian-2, which according to the International Atomic Energy Agency provides about 28% of the country’s electricity generation. ",
            "“We are considering which of these options is economically beneficial for us,” he said. ",
            "According to Public Radio of Armenia, Pashinyan also backed the potential deployment of small modular reactors. He said that because they have a lower capacity Armenia could build one SMR module and then add others as needed.",
            "Pashinyan was reported as saying plans for larger nuclear plants might be problematic because experts have said accommodating large plants on the grid will be difficult.",
            "“Other proposals are somewhat problematic as they envisage building plants with a capacity of 1,000 MWt, while experts say there are problems with fitting 1,000 megawatts into our energy system.”",
            "Armenia has not yet released a schedule for the completion of a selection process for a plant supplier, but a team from Armenia will be travelling to the US “in the near future” to examine options provided by manufacturers of modular nuclear power plants, Pashinyan said. ",
            "An official from US Assistance to Europe and Eurasia, an office of the US State Department that oversees aid to former Soviet states and Eastern Europe, said: “In a number of countries, including Armenia, we are assessing the feasibility of small modular nuclear reactors – built with US technology – that could facilitate greater energy independence from both Russia and the PRC [China].”",
            "Armenian-2, at Metsamor, 30km outside of the Armenian capital of Yerevan, began commercial operation in 1980. It was shut down after a major earthquake struck the region in 1988 and remained offline until 1995, when it was reopened in an independent Armenia then struggling to meet demand for electric power. ",
            "The VVER-440 pressurised water reactor unit had an initial operating lifetime of 30 years starting in 1996 and set to expire in 2026. In March 2023, Armenian authorities granted an extra 10 years of operation until 2036 subject to maintenance works.",
            "The prime minister’s comments suggest there will be no more extensions to its working life with 2036 established as a hard deadline for its retirement. ",
            "The article was updated on 12 June 2023 to reflect the operating lifetime extension of Armenian-2 until 2036."

            "Company targets commercial version of reactors by 2032",
            "A group of 13 Japanese companies led by Onomichi Dockyard and Imabari Shipbuilding has invested $80m (€74m) in a project to build floating nuclear power plants, British energy startup Core Power announced. ",
            "According to Core Power, floating nuclear power plants would offer a number of clear competitive advantages over conventional land-based facilities. In addition to being smaller, more efficient and less expensive to build and operate, being offshore would protect them from the consequences of earthquakes and tsunamis. ",
            "Core Power said offshore nuclear power production is an ideal solution for Japan, an island nation still recovering from the Fukushima-Daiichi accident in 2011.  Japan has been slow to recommission its existing nuclear plants despite expected growth in demand. Offshore production could play a key role in addressing both safety and economic concerns in the near future, CorePower said. ",
            "Core Power is working with TerraPower and Southern Company, both US-based energy firms, and Orano of France, a nuclear fuel cycle company, to develop molten chloride fast reactors, a type of small modular reactor. TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, is planning for the deployment of its Natrium nuclear plant in the US.",
            "The design does not require pressurisation, thus avoiding much of the equipment required in land-based solid-fuel nuclear plants. It also removes the potential for meltdowns. ",
            "The floating plants will have an output of 300 MW, about a quarter of traditional nuclear power plants.",
            "Core Power plans to build a working floating reactor prototype by 2026, a project the company says will cost about $361m, and introduce commercially viable versions of the reactors between 2030 and 2032.",
            "The costs of the project beyond the Japanese investment will be shared among Core Power and its partner companies. ",
            "",
            "Nikkei Asia said the Japanese role in Core Power’s research and development is aligned with the country’s plans for supporting the next generation of nuclear energy and small modular technology in particular. The policy was approved by the government in February. ",
            "According to Nikkei Asia, the development of floating reactors will need reliable supply chains and firms to design and produce components. The sector also faces a fragmented regulatory landscape and environmental impact studies that may take years, Nikkei Asia reported. ",
            "In May 2020, Russia began commercial operation of what is so far the world’s only floating nuclear power station, the Akademik Lomonosov, docked at the port town of Pevek in Russia’s far east Chukotka autonomous district.",
            "The 21,000-tonne vessel has two KLT-40S reactor units with an electrical power generating capacity of 35 MW each, sufficient for a city with a population of around 200,000 people.",
            "More recently, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power and shipbuilder Samsung Heavy Industries of South Korea announced a consortium with Denmark-based Seaborg Technologies to develop floating nuclear power plants using Seaborg’s molten salt reactor technology."

            "Hesthammer said the Rolls-Royce agreement was “an important step towards the goal of establishing nuclear power as a central part of the energy mix in Norway”.",
            "He said reports from the EU and the UN show that modern nuclear power plants are a good choice in terms of climate, nature, the environment and human health. ",
            "Rolls-Royce reactors will be able to deliver large amounts of energy in a very small area at an affordable price – and without government subsidies, Hesthammer said.",
            "",
            "“In Norway, such small nuclear power plants will be able to work very well together with renewables and contribute to stabilising the energy supply as the proportion of weather-dependent power increases in the energy mix.”",
            "Norsk Kjernekraft said it had seen “a rapid and positive turn” in favour of considering nuclear power in Norway. The company said it was “already in dialogue” with politicians from a number of parties and perceives them to be interested in learning more. “That includes the governing parties,” the company said.",
            "Norway has never had commercial nuclear power plants, but has operated two research reactors for the production of medical radioisotopes and research purposes. ",
            "The two research reactors are the nuclear fuel and materials testing reactor at Halden and the Jeep II neutron scattering facility at Kjeller. They were permanently shut down in June 2018 and April 2019 respectively. ",
            "The country has a disposal facility for low and medium level radioactive waste from radioactive sources used in industry and medicine as well as that generated by the research reactors. Norway also plans new medical irradiation facilities at hospitals in Oslo and Bergen."

            "Welsh affairs committee says government ambition on nuclear energy must be translated into action",
            "The UK government should develop its next gigawatt-size nuclear power reactors after Sizewell C at the Wylfa site in north Wales and earmark the nearby Trawsfynydd site for the country’s first small modular reactors, a committee of MPs has concluded.",
            "The Welsh affairs committee said in its latest report on nuclear energy in Wales that if the UK government is serious about nuclear energy it needs to pursue new gigawatt-scale plants alongside its policy on SMRs.",
            "Government ambition on nuclear energy must be translated into action by pushing ahead with new reactors at the Wylfa nuclear power station in north Wales.",
            "“We have heard from a wide range of industry representatives that Wylfa is one of the best sites for nuclear development and it is difficult to see how the UK government can deliver its nuclear ambitions without taking forward a project at Wylfa,” the committee said.",
            "“We consider that Wylfa should be the location of the next gigawatt-scale nuclear generation plant after Sizewell C.”",
            "The committee said the UK government should continue to engage with Welsh government body Cwmni Egino on its ambition for Trawsfynydd to become the first site to host SMRs in the UK. ",
            "“We urge the government to include the Trawsfynydd site in the new Nuclear National Policy Statement as a potential site for SMRs,” the committee said.",
            "",
            "The committee said that successfully developing an SMR would present a huge opportunity for the UK, but noted the technology is still in development phase. ",
            "“Concrete commitment” by ministers on the future of nuclear energy, and in particular at Wylfa on Anglesey, is lacking despite positive policy signals, the committee said.",
            "New nuclear could be “a game-changer” for the North Wales economy, but warned that despite this, major obstacles remain before Wylfa could be home to a gigawatt-scale nuclear power station.",
            "The limitations of finance models and failure to reach a financial agreement with the UK government led to the Hitachi-led Wylfa Newydd project being suspended in 2019. The contracts for difference (CfD) financing model has been used to support nuclear energy projects including Hinkley Point C in southwest England.",
            "However, evidence to the committee suggested that a regulated asset base (RAB) model could reduce the overall cost of a large-scale nuclear project by £30bn (€34bn) compared with CfD. The committee heard that RAB is more attractive to investors, but the committee was concerned that the model puts some liability back to the taxpayer. It said careful monitoring of the RAB model for Sizewell C is therefore crucial.",
            "The issue of land ownership at Wylfa is a further barrier to progress. The committee said it is “unclear what the current state of plays is” at the site and called on the government to encourage Hitachi, which owns the Wylfa land, to sell it or join other developers to enable future development to proceed.",
            "",
            "The committee welcomed the UK government’s plans to include nuclear energy in the green taxonomy, saying the move will unlock new avenues of private investment for nuclear development and send the signals needed to the financial sector that nuclear energy is an attractive investment.",
            "The committee is exploring how likely it is that there will be a successful new nuclear development at Wylfa in light of the UK government’s shift towards nuclear energy. ",
            "Despite the rise of nuclear energy up the policy agenda to address both climate change and the UK’s energy security, the question of new nuclear at Wylfa has been ongoing for over a decade. ",
            "Wylfa and Trawsfynydd are both historic nuclear sites that both have two permanently shut-down nuclear reactors.",
            "Hitachi and project company Horizon Nuclear Power attempted to bring new gigawatt-scale reactors to Wylfa Newydd, on land next to the decommissioned Magnox reactors.",
            "However, Hitachi withdrew from the development in 2020 after failing to reach a financing agreement with the government. ",
            "In March 2023, the government published Powering Up Britain, a series of documents which set out how it will improve energy security and deliver on net zero. In the documents, the government recommitted itself to having 24 GW of nuclear energy – up from less than 6 GW today – by 2050 with a final investment decision on Sizewell C by the end of 2024 and two further nuclear projects to a final investment decision by the by the end of 2029.",

            "Project company has already used new rules to apply for ‘decision-in-principle’",
            "Polish nuclear project company Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe’s (PEJ) application last week for a “decision-in-principle” on new nuclear was the result of amendments to nuclear law that allowed it to apply at the beginning of the investment process – effectively securing state support for any project before the need for significant investment.",
            "The amendments, which went into effect this week, included several pieces of legislation. One of the most important was the so-called Nuclear Special Act, which aims to clear the way for investment in a nuclear power station.",
            "In July 2021, the Polish ministry of climate and the environment put forward proposed changes to the existing legal framework with the goal of streamlining the processes of preparation and licensing for new nuclear. After several rounds of reviews by legislators, Poland’s president signed the new framework into law in March 2023, with its coming into force scheduled for April 2023.",
            "Energy news portal Wysokienapiecie said one of the main objectives of the amendments is to better structure the process of obtaining permits for investment in nuclear energy.",
            "Wysokienapiecie said the amendments eliminate the risk of “a multi-month downtime” for new nuclear projects pending the issuance of a permit for operation. It said the special act lacks any reference to small modular nuclear reactors, which “calls into question the promises of their rapid implementation”.",
            "Another amendment, intended to speed up the procedure for obtaining approvals by about 1.5 years, is the possibility of parallel proceedings. ",
            "This will allow an investor in new nuclear to submit documents for the next step without having to wait for pending decisions from preceding stages. ",
            "For example, the amendment includes the option of applying for a building permit to the local provincial governor before obtaining a construction permit from the Polish nuclear regulator. Previously, the governor’s decision would depend on that of the regulator.",
            "",
            "The new regulations will also close the gap between commissioning and commercial operation by introducing a temporary regulatory approval step for the period between the end of commissioning activities and the formal start of commercial operation. Under earlier laws, the operator would have had to shut down a nuclear plant between the commissioning phaseand the actual start of commercial operation.",
            "Kamil Orzel, a Warsaw district councillor, former director of the regulatory department at industrial group KGHM Polska Miedz, which is considering the use of small modular reactors, said in a social media post that the changes should be viewed “very positively” as ones that will speed up the investment process. ",
            "“What they lack are issues related to finance. This concerns both the model of financing nuclear investments and the subsequent shape of the energy market and the position of nuclear energy on it.”",
            "Earlier this week PEJ submitted an application to the country’s ministry of climate and the environment for a decision-in-principle on the proposed construction of a first nuclear power station in the northern province of Pomerania. The submission followed the introduction of the nuclear law amendments.",
            "According to Poland’s 2020 nuclear energy programme, construction of the first plant is scheduled to begin in 2026 with commercial operation in 2033. Other units will follow until the early 2040s for a total installed capacity of between 6,000 MW to 9,000 MW spread across two sites.",
            "In November 2022, Warsaw said it had chosen US-based Westinghouse Electric to supply its AP1000 reactor technology for a three-unit nuclear power station most likely at the Lubiatowo-Kopalino site near the Baltic coast in Pomerania."

            "In 2021, Belgium generated more than 50% of its electricity from its fleet of reactors, a figure that could now fall considerably. With Doel-3 and Tihange-2 both shut down, Belgium will lose 2,014 MW (net), or about 33%, of installed capacity from a total of 5,942 MW (net), based on International Atomic Energy Agency data.",
            "“After Doel-3 was shut down in September, Tihange-2 will also close tomorrow. Together they provided almost as much electricity as solar and wind combined. Tragic. Keeping as many nuclear plants open as long as possible should be an absolute priority,” conservative politician Bart De Wever of the New Flemish Alliance tweeted on Monday.",
            "François De Smet of the social-liberal party DéFI said the closure “plunges Belgium a little more into uncertainty”. His party is also calling for investment in Generation IV nuclear power.",
            "",
            "DéFI called for Belgium’s two newest reactors, Doel-4 and Tihange-3, to have their lifetimes extended for 20 years as opposed to the 10 years set out in a recent agreement.",
            "“But above all, it is necessary to invest quickly in the new generation of nuclear power,” DéFI said in a statement. “Projects like the Iter [International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor] programme or small modular reactors are part of that future,” the party said in a press release.",
            "The Brussels-based Belgian Nuclear Forum said Belgium should repeal its 2003 nuclear exit law as it looks for ways to deal with the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and resulting gas and electricity price increases, ",
            "The underlying argument of the 2003 law is that a nuclear plant is obsolete after 40 years and should be decommissioned, the forum said.",
            "“Nothing could be further from the truth: there are no technical arguments for definitively shutting down a nuclear power plant after 40 years of operation, but only political arguments,” it added.",
            "“These decisions are the result of the 2003 law relating to the exit from nuclear power, when there was no energy crisis,” the forum said. “Wouldn’t it be a responsible (and necessary) policy to repeal the 2003 nuclear exit law?”",
            "Belgium had planned to exit nuclear power entirely in 2025, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine forced the government to rethink plans to rely more on natural gas."

            "Around Europe, companies signed deals related to all stages of SMR development and deployment. Companies in Poland and the Czech Republic have announced SMR programmes. Most recently, US nuclear plant developer NuScale Power and Romania’s RoPower signed a contract\r\nfor front-end engineering and design (Feed) work, marking a significant step towards the deployment of a NuScale Voygr small modular reactor power plant in Romania. The UK is looking at its first SMR by the early years of the next decade. The potentially game-changing technology is under consideration as far afield as Canada, the Philippines, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. In the US, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) announced its intent to issue a final rule to certify NuScale Power’s SMR. Once published, companies can soon start referencing the SMR design in their combined licensing applications. Tennessee Valley Authority announced an agreement with GE-Hitachi to support planning and preliminary licensing efforts for the potential deployment of a BWRX-300 SMR at the Clinch River site. Other big announcements included Dow and X-energy agreeing to deploy an Xe-100 SMR at one of Dow’s US Gulf Coast sites by 2030 as well as TerraPower and PacifiCorp exploring the possibility of building five additional Natrium reactors in the PacifiCorp service area by 2035.\n\n",

            "The British government confirmed the Sizewell C nuclear power station will go ahead, backing the scheme with a £700m (€809m) stake and saying it wants to see more nuclear projects being prepared. Funding for the project was signed off by Boris Johnson at the start of September in one of his last acts as prime minister and confirmed by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his autumn statement. The twin EPR station is a joint endeavour with French state energy giant EDF and is expected to take a decade to build at the cost of between £20-£30bn. Large-scale reactors are under construction or consideration around the world. Test production has begun at Olkiluoto-3 in Finland and Flamanville-3 in France is close to completion, while fuel is being loaded at Vogtle in the US. Construction continued at Akkuyu, Turkey’s first nuclear station, with a second under consideration. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, around 30 countries are considering or embarking on the construction of new reactors. They include established nuclear nations such as the UK, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, China and India, and newcomers such as Poland, Ghana, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and Indonesia. The International Energy Agency says a new wave of construction will be key to achieving net zero and ensuring energy security.  ",

Three Westinghouse-made AP1000 pressurised water reactor units will be deployed at the Lubiatowo-Kopalino site in the northern province of Pomerania. The first unit is scheduled to be online in 2033 as set in Warsaw’s 2020 nuclear energy programme while the start of construction is earmarked for 2026. Under a 2020 nuclear programme, Poland has ambitious plans to build from 6,000 to 9,000 MW of installed nuclear with commercial operation of a first nuclear unit in a proposed set of six is planned for 2033, with the rest to follow throughout the 2030s and into the early 2040s. Warsaw Also said it remains “open” to cooperation with the European and global nuclear industries for the deployment of a second nuclear power plant in the country despite selecting Westinghouse for the construction of a first nuclear power station. Polish energy companies ZE PAK and PGE signed a letter of intent with South Korea’s KHNP for the proposed construction of a third nuclear power station at the Patnow site in central Poland – a project described as one to be developed by “private business” and not run by the government.",

A report by TerraPraxis said replacing coal-fired boilers at existing coal plants with carbon-free SMRs, also known as advanced heat sources, would transform coal-fired power plants from polluting liabilities facing an uncertain future, into a central component of a clean energy system transition – an important part of the massive and pressing infrastructure buildout needed to address climate change. The US Department of Energy said This “coal-to-nuclear” transition could add a substantial amount of clean electricity to the grid, helping the US reach its net-zero emissions goals by 2050. TerraPower, a company co-founded by Bill Gates, plans to deploy its Natrium reactor technology at a coal site in the US state of Wyoming. In Poland Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power began investigating the site of coal plant in southern Poland for the construction of APR1400 nuclear power plants.

Oil-rich Saudi Arabia began the process of choosing a vendor\r\nfor the construction of its first commercial nuclear power station with bids likely to come from South Korea, France, China and Russia. Riyadh wants to build two 1,400 MW nuclear power plants, a down-sized effort from an ambitious goal set in 2014 to build 16 units of about 1,000 MW each. Saudi Arabia said earlier this year it is aiming to take advantage of its significant uranium resources to develop a commercial nuclear power programme. The United Arab Emirates, another of the world’s largest oil producers, is already building four reactors at Barakah. Two units are operating and a third is due to begin operating soon.",

            "According to nucleareurope, in recent years some national governments have downplayed the benefits of the nuclear sector, opting to promote other technologies or industries as attractive career opportunities. The group would like to see this rhetoric reversed and more EU funding allocated to promoting and supporting the long-term benefits of nuclear and the education and training needed to fulfill this ambition. ",
            "There are several EU platforms that are intended to support innovation, research, science and education among member states such the Strategic Energy Technology (Set) plan, the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNETP) and its Education, Training and Knowledge Management (ETKM) Working Group, as well as the European Nuclear Education Network (ENEN). ",
            "One of the commissions’ tasks under the Set plan is to as assess the educational and training needs of the future professionals in the field of nuclear energy, but progress seems to have stalled.",
            "“There has been some interest by some national governments to speak to their nuclear industries and try and get those future workforce figures, but progress has been limited. The last EHRO-N report was published in 2015 and this can be a telling example,” said Ms Janisz.",
            "According to ENRO-H, the need for partnership and coordination between government, industry, educational and training providers, science and research communities is crucial to the EU strategies.",
            "“A good example is Spain where academia works closely with industry and responds to industry skills' needs, supported by government,” said Ms Janisz. “A similar situation can be observed in Hungary in another example, where a partnership hub including research and science works closely with the nuclear plant operator and its training centres”.",
            "The nuclear industry should put more effort into investing and maintaining its human capital by working closely with local and national governments and other stakeholders, like the network of young professionals YGN, nucleareurope said.",
            "It called for closer collaboration between the industry and research institutes and said the industry should do more to assess the different types of skills and competences which will be needed over the next 30 years.",
            "",
            "“The nuclear industry needs to be more open-minded about bringing people onboard who do not necessarily have a mechanical engineering or a nuclear engineering educational background,” said Mr Thomas. “There needs to be more flexibility.”",
            "“And there is something else, which is increasingly important,” said YGN’s Ms Najder. “How is the industry going to communicate a new fresh image, an image of ‘coolness’ if you like, in order to attract those young people today, who are different than those 20 or 30 years earlier”?",
            "Mr Thomas sees promise in recent advances the nuclear industry has made on small modular reactors (SMRs). “These SMRs and advanced Generation IV reactors are not just bringing innovation, they are bringing the possibility of rebranding, of rediscovering, to the nuclear industry,” he said.",
            "“I believe this new wave of net-zero technology enthusiasm and inspiration can attract young people to the sector. I don’t remember seeing a better promise for a long-term career in nuclear over the last two decades.”",
            "One of the areas where the nuclear industry needs to improve is the promotion of diversity, Mr Thomas said.",
            "A recent report by the International Energy Agency said the share of women working in senior positions in the nuclear sector is the lowest of all energy sectors at only 8%. Coal is 9% with electric utilities among the highest with nearly 20%.",
            "“We have to keep in mind that most young people today who are considering their education and career choices are going to be looking for sectors and employers that are inclusive and diverse,” said Mr Thomas.",
            "“They have flexible mindsets, they like hybrid working, look at the way they commute to work, and whom they are working with. The values of an organisation are very important,” he said."

            "In the APS, around $6tn (€5.7tn) in investment is required to 2050 to reduce emissions from coal‐fired power in line with national climate targets. Around 90% of this sum is spent on low‐emissions generation, mainly renewables but also nuclear power, with the remainder for energy storage and expanding and modernising electricity grids. ",

            "The NZE illustrates a path to achieve the goal of 1.5C stabilisation in the rise in global average temperatures. Coal use falls by 90% by 2050 and the global power sector is completely decarbonised in advanced economies by 2035, and worldwide by 2040.  ",
            "The report says retired coal plant sites can be used for alternative electricity generating technologies, including nuclear power plants based on SMR technology. A number of small reactors can be built on the site of retired coal‐fired unit, allowing for the potential reuse of much of the existing infrastructure for grid connections.",

            "‘Unabated’ refers to the underlying industrial process before (or in the absence of) the application of pollution control measures. In the case of coal power generation, abatement is generally understood to mean the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS), or carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technology. Essentially, ‘unabated coal’ refers to coal power plants without CC(U)S technology equipment. CCS is a way of reducing carbon emissions, which could be key to helping to tackle global warming. It’s a three-step process, involving: capturing the carbon dioxide produced by power generation or industrial activity, such as steel or cement making; transporting it; and then storing it deep underground."

            "Grossi and US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm, the conference president, delivered opening remarks at the three-day event in Washington together with William Magwood, director-general of the Nuclear Energy Agency. ",
            "",
            "Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, and investor and philanthropist Bill Gates spoke via video at the conference, attended by more than 750 participants including ministers, policymakers and experts from around the world.",
            "Gates told the conference: “We need advanced reactors as well as contribution from the installed base of reactors we have today. Using this clean energy source is important to a clean energy future.”",
            "TerraPower, a reactor technology company founded by Gates, is developing its Natrium reactor technology in partnership with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy. In 2021, TerraPower announced its intention to build the first Natrium reactor\r\nat a retiring coal facility in Kemmerer, Wyoming.",
            "The opening speakers pointed to growing global interest in using nuclear power to help achieve net zero emissions while ensuring energy security and contributing to sustainable development. They stressed the continuous need for high standards of nuclear safety, security and safeguards.",
            "Grossi said he saw “great hopes” the world “can realise this imperative of the time: to bring the solutions in terms of prosperity, in terms of growth, in terms of caring for the common house, our planet, through the beneficial uses of nuclear energy”.",

            "In her opening remarks, Granholm said: “We see enormous potential in nuclear power to advance our climate goals, to enhance our energy security, to widen affordable energy access, to create millions of high quality, good paying jobs.”",
            "The second largest low-carbon source of electricity after hydro power, nuclear energy provides around 10% of the world’s electricity. By producing a steady supply of low carbon electricity, as well as industrial heat and hydrogen, nuclear power can help decarbonise sectors such as industry. ",
            "According to the NEA, nuclear power needs to triple in generating capacity by 2050 to meet climate goals, Magwood said. But in addition to providing low carbon power, “our highest responsibility is to make sure that our people, our populations, our societies have access to reliable energy – that they have secure energy”, he added.",
            "The IEA sees a future “dominated by electricity, and clean, secure electricity is a must,” Birol said. “Here, together with renewables, which will get the lion’s share of the growth in electricity generation, nuclear has an important role to play.”"

            "In two other scenarios, which consider stated policies (the Steps) and announced pledges (the APS), nuclear generation increases by 2030, with China accounting for the largest growth.",
            "The Steps scenario shows the trajectory implied by today’s policy settings. The APS scenario assumes that all aspirational targets announced by governments are met on time and in full, including their long‐term net zero and energy access goals. The NZE scenario by 2050 maps out a way to achieve a 1.5 °C stabilisation in the rise in global average temperatures, alongside universal access to modern energy by 2030.",
            "According to the report, a rising number of countries have announced plans to support new nuclear investment. For example, in February 2022, France announced plans to build six new large reactors starting in 2028 at a cost of about €50bn ($50.4bn), with an option to build eight more by 2050. ",
            "China plans to continue its current pace of construction of nuclear reactors in order to help meet its goal of carbon neutrality by 2060. ",
            "Worldwide, the largest new build nuclear programme is in China.  New projects could see China add as much 160 GW of capacity, on top of the 50 GW in operation today. ",
            "By some distance, China is now the leading global investor in nuclear, solar, onshore and offshore wind and hydropower generation technologies, the report says.",
            "Also in Asia, South Korea has recently reversed its nuclear phaseout policy and now supports lifetime extensions of existing facilities, the restarting of construction at two sites and an increase in the share of nuclear in electricity generation. ",
            "There is growing interest in the potential for small modular reactors to contribute to emissions reductions and power system reliability. ",
            "But the continued role of nuclear power in the electricity sector relies on decisions to extend the lifetime of existing reactors and the success of programmes to build new ones. ",
            "In the Steps scenario, nuclear maintains its share of about 10% in total electricity generation. This requires the completion of 120 GW of new nuclear capacity over the 2022‐30 period, as well as the addition of another 300 GW worth of new reactors – the equivalent of almost three‐quarters of the current global fleet – between 2030 and 2050 in over 30 countries. ",
            "In the APS, around 18 GW of new nuclear capacity is added per year until 2050, over a quarter more than in the Steps, but the higher level of electricity demand in this scenario means that the nuclear share of the electricity supply mix remains at close to 10%. ",
            "In the NZE Scenario, a wave of reactor lifetime extensions in advanced economies in the 2020s helps limit global emissions. An average of 24 GW of capacity added each year between 2022 and 2050 more than doubles nuclear power capacity by 2050. ",
            "The nuclear share of the electricity mix, however, falls to 8% in 2050 due to very strong growth in electricity demand in the NZE Scenario.",
            "The report says the world is facing a global energy crisis of unprecedented depth and complexity. This is prompting a range of short‐term responses from governments as well as a deeper debate about the ways to avoid such disruptions in the future. ",
            "Pressures on markets pre-dated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but its actions have tipped what was a strong recovery from the pandemic into full‐blown turmoil in energy markets, causing severe damage to the global economy.",
            "This is a global crisis, but Europe is the main theatre in which it is playing out, and natural gas is centre stage, the report says. Russia is seeking to gain political leverage by withholding gas supplies and exposing consumers to higher energy bills and supply shortages over the winter heating season. ",
            "As of September 2022, Russia’s gas deliveries to the European Union were down by 80% compared to where they have been in recent years. ",
            "The report says the global energy crisis triggered by the war is causing profound and long-lasting changes that have the potential to hasten the transition to a more sustainable and secure energy system.",
            "One of the results of this is that investment in nuclear power is coming back into favour in some countries. There have been announcements of lifetime extensions for existing reactors, often as part of the response to the current crisis, as well as announcements of new construction, for example in Japan and France.

            "Late last year, as part of a project involving companies run by billionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, a retiring coal plant site in Kemmerer, Wyoming, was chosen as the preferred location for a new generation Natrium nuclear power reactor.",
            "",
            "US-based reactor developer TerraPower, a company co-founded by Bill Gates, said it had chosen the Kemmerer location, near the Naughton coal power plant about 100 km northeast of Salt Lake City, following an extensive evaluation process and meetings with community members and leaders. It said the new plant could be in operation by 2028.",
            "By locating the Natrium reactor near the retiring Naughton coal plant, TerraPower can take advantage of the existing energy infrastructure that is in place –cooling water and transmission, for example – and also the workforce.",
            "US-based small modular reactor developer NuScale Power has said building SMRs at the “considerable” number of fossil fuel and coal plants that will be going out of service towards the end of the decade and beyond means workers can be cross-trained and millions of dollars saved by using existing infrastructure.",
            "“The infrastructure is all there and we can save about $100m by using it,” chief executive officer John Hopkins said. “We are in talks with a couple of potential customers.”",
            "NuScale conducted a study in the US which estimated that, on average, approximately $100m of existing coal plant infrastructure such the plant’s cooling water delivery systems, site fire protection and existing transmission system connection could be reused for a NuScale plant. The company has also signed a number of agreements for potential SMR deployment in Europe, including coal sites in Poland.",
            "A report by TerraPraxis, a non-profit organisation focused on action for climate and prosperity, said repowering existing coal plant infrastructure is the largest single carbon abatement opportunity on the planet and could greatly accelerate the clean energy transition while using existing infrastructure and maintaining vital jobs, according to a report.",

            "“Downblending is only a temporary solution for the first core load,” TerraPower said. “This does not negate the need for a fully functional, fully funded advanced fuel availability programme for subsequent cores and to meet the growing demand of advanced nuclear technologies.”",
            "HEU is uranium that has been enriched to at least 20% uranium-235, a higher concentration than exists in natural uranium ore. It has been used in research reactors, military reactors and a small number of commercial reactors, but can also be used to make nuclear weapons. ",
            "The US has HEU stockpile estimated to be about 490 tonnes as of the beginning of 2020. ",
            "Advanced nuclear technologies are “vital” to meeting carbon-free energy targets, TerraPower said. New reactors need to be demonstrated this decade to ensure full commercial deployment in the 2030s and beyond. ",
            "Most advanced nuclear reactors under development in the US, including TerraPower’s own Natrium small modular reactor, rely on Haleu, or high assay low enriched uranium, fuel. Haleu fuel is a class of nuclear fuel that allows advanced nuclear reactors to deliver electricity with enhanced environmental benefits and greater efficiency that is unmatched by the current nuclear fleet.  ",
            "A major hurdle for the development and commercialisation of advanced nuclear reactors, however, is that there is currently no domestic supply chain of Haleu that can provide fuel at commercial levels. A full and viable fuel supply chain for advanced nuclear energy includes the mining, conversion and enrichment of uranium, deconversion of Haleu into a metal and the fabrication of fuel rods that ultimately power the reactors.   ",
            "In order to carve out a sustainable path to a carbon-free energy future, advanced nuclear energy fuelled by Haleu “must play a prominent role”, TerraPower said. At the same time, the US must dissolve its dependence on Russian uranium to produce nuclear fuel. Historically, the US has turned to Russia and its allies for a significant percentage of fuel to power the over 90 currently operating reactors in the US today.",
            "TerraPower has invested in a domestic Haleu supply chain on multiple fronts. However, early advanced reactor strategies relied on Russia’s established Haleu production facilities to provide the first core loads while domestic capabilities were developed. ",
            "“As a result of the invasion in Ukraine, this is no longer a viable approach and the urgency to develop domestic advanced fuel infrastructure has been thrust to the forefront,” TerraPower said.    ",
            "According to TerraPower, the US is taking steps in the right direction. Earlier this year, Congress appropriated $45m (€44m) for a programme to help expedite the commercialisation of Haleu in the US. The Inflation Reduction Act, recently signed into law by president Joe Biden, dictates special provisions for Haleu. This includes setting aside $700m to support the availability of Haleu for both research and commercial uses, the licensing of production facilities and the establishment of a Haleu stockpile. ",
            "“But one more critical piece of the puzzle remains,” TerraPower said. “In order for advanced nuclear development to stay on track we need a short-term solution, along with congressional support, until the domestic Haleu supply chain is fully operational.” "

It has the potential to contribute further to the decarbonisation of the world’s energy sector if it is also used to provide heat through cogeneration for industrial applications, which today mainly run on fossil fuels. ",
            "The feasibility of these “non-electrical” applications of nuclear energy has already been demonstrated through decades of experience with approximately 67 reactors around the world – representing about 15% of the world’s reactors –providing either district heating, desalination or some other form of process heat. ",
            "However, to date, cogeneration applications have used only a small fraction of nuclear energy. ",
            "The report says a “solid understanding” of the economics of nuclear cogeneration, including the associated system costs, is essential. However, there is no clear methodology to assess the economic case for developing non-electrical applications of nuclear energy, even though such applications have been developed at an industrial scale, especially in the area of district heating.",
            "Cogeneration uses heat and electricity from nuclear reactors for non-power applications such as district heating, which supplies hot water or steam to a group of urban residential or commercial buildings through a heat distribution pipe network. It can also be used for the production of hydrogen and synthetic fuels, or desalination, all processes that today mainly run on fossil fuels or biomass. ",
            "Heat production is responsible for a large part of air pollution issues worldwide. Unlike electricity, heat is produced close to where it is consumed, which means that when fossil fuels are burnt for building or industrial heating or in transport, airborne pollutants are spread out over residential and industrial areas, causing sometimes severe public health problems for urban dwellers and workers.

            "Cogeneration is the integration of nuclear power plants with other systems and applications. The heat generated by nuclear power plants can be used to produce a vast range of products such as cooling, heating, process heat, desalination and hydrogen. The heat generated by a nuclear power plant is thus used not only to generate electricity, but to address “difficult to decarbonise” energy demands such as domestic heating. The use of nuclear energy for cogeneration also provides the benefit of using nuclear fuel in more efficient and eco-friendly manner.

            "Heat generated by civil nuclear reactors can be extracted at two different points for applications requiring either low-temperature or high-temperature heat. Applications for the lower temperature “waste” heat include district heating, seawater desalination and low-temperature industrial process heating. Higher temperature heat can be used for high-temperature industrial process heating, hydrogen production, sustainable synthetic fuel production, direct air capture and thermal energy storage. The International Atomic Energy Agency says the use of nuclear energy for cogeneration provides “many economic, environmental and efficiency-related benefits”."

            "The IEA said in May 2021 report on net-zero emissions by 2050 that nuclear power could double between 2020 and 2050, with new nuclear plants needing to be built in countries which have chosen the nuclear power option.",
            "The agency said further efforts will be needed to stop the nuclear fleets of advanced economies from shrinking by one-third by 2030. ",
            "Lifetime extensions of existing plans alone cannot reverse the trend, the IEA said and added that generally long-term operation of nuclear is cost-competitive with wind and solar.",
            "According to the new IEA report, the nuclear industry must do better to deliver projects below cost and within budget to guarantee that nuclear-generated electricity is competitive. ",
            "This would mean completing nuclear projects in advanced economies at around $5,000/kW by 2030, compared with the reported capital costs of around $9,000/kW (excluding financing costs) for first-of-a kind projects. The report said construction costs would need to be decreased even further to $2,000-$3,000/kW for nuclear to remain competitive and play a “larger role”.",
            "The agency stressed that government financing will remain necessary to mobilise new investment, not just for new-build but also to develop the latest technologies. There is rarely sufficient private sector financing for such capital-intensive and long-lived assets, particularly those exposed to significant policy risk, the report said.",
            "As a result of project delays and cost hikes, advanced economies “have lost market leadership, as 27 out of 31 reactors that started construction since 2017 are Russian or Chinese designs,” said Fatih Birol.",
            "The IEA said that strong policy support will also be needed for the successful development and eventual long-term deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs), which are not yet commercially viable. The agency’s 2050 net-zero generation forecasts assume that about half of nuclear energy at the time will come from SMRs.",

            "According to SaskPower, OPG’s decision to choose GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 design was part of its own assessment of the available options as it had been looking at the potential for “a pan-Canadian, fleet-based” deployment of nuclear power from SMRs since 2019.",
            "The company said a fleet-based approach has many advantages for Saskatchewan, including lower regulatory, construction and operating costs, and eliminates risks related to a first-of-a-kind project.",
            "The BWRX-300 is a 300-MW water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems and based on an existing boiling water reactor design – the ESBWR – that is licensed in the US. It also uses an existing, licensed fuel design. ",
            "GEH has said the reactor will require significantly less capital cost per MW when compared to other water-cooled SMR designs or existing large nuclear reactor designs."

            "“Commercialisation of SMR solutions will have a positive impact on energy security, the environment, and the competitiveness of the Polish economy,” Mr Majewski said.",
            "According to the statement, Enea and Last Energy agreed on the possibility of setting up a jointly owned company in Poland for the purpose of the project.",
            "The signing event last week was attended by Polish minister of state assets Jacek Sasin, who said: “This is a historic moment. We show that in practice we are building Poland's long-term energy security”.",
            " “We want nuclear energy – the traditional, large and state-built energy, as well as the micro-dimension – to be our future,” Mr Sasin said.",
            "Poland wants to build from 6,000 to 9,000 MW of installed nuclear capacity based on proven, large-scale, pressurised water reactor (PWR) technology, with commercial operation of a first unit in a proposed set of six is planned for 2033.",
            "Large players in the energy and heavy industries like Orlen, Synthos, KGHM, ZEPAK, have separately been showing interest in the development and deployment of SMR units for industrial use in addition to conventional nuclear.",
            "Last Energy said it provides the full cycle of nuclear project development for customers including design, construction, financing, service and maintenance of installations, fuel supply and waste collection and decommissioning of the power plant at the end of its operation. ",
            "The company said its SMR plant leverages a proven PWR and fully modular plant design, and its development model aims to deliver a power plant within 24 months of signing.",
            "“Scaling small modular nuclear power isn’t 10 years away. The technology is proven and ready, now,” said Bret Kugelmass, chief executive of Last Energy.",
            "The US company told NucNet in an email that it is currently building a mechanical demonstration plant in Houston, Texas, which is expected to show the core elements of manufacturability, modular construction techniques, and light water primary loop design.",

            "Last Energy said its plan is to have fully functional power plants within 3 months of receiving all government and community approvals.",
            "The company is in talks with governments, regulators and commercial energy partners across Europe, Latin America and Asia. In March 2022, Romania announced its intention to work with Last Energy to develop an SMR at the central Mioveni site, Last Energy said.",
            "Last Energy has not received any government funding and is pursuing purely private financing “to best align incentives of cost efficiency and speed to deployment,” a spokesperson told NucNet.",
            "The company has hired industry partners like Wood and Atkins to support the development of its project and has received technical validation of its proposed plant design by US national labs and several large nuclear utilities both in the US and across Europe, the spokesperson said.",
            "Last Energy was set up in 2021 as a spin-off from the US-based Energy Impact Centre (EIC) energy transition think tank, which was founded in 2017.",
            "In 2020, the EIC started the Open100\r\nopen-source research platform which was intended to serve as a foundation for new power plant construction concept, offering developers a web interface to visualise plant and component design, costs studies, and construction plans. Last Energy, however, said their proposed 20-MW SMR plant is being developed independently from the Open100 platform, which had a purely academic bearing."

            "Mr Gajda said a decision on reactor technology is needed to proceed to the next stages of the project – to prepare final project and to prepare the safety report and all the other documents necessary to obtain the permit from the Polish Atomic Energy Agency [PAA]”.",
            "He said the financial element of the project will be a challenge. ",
            "“There are expectations from all potential partners that the offers will include an option of financing such as taking up shares or granting loans,” Mr Gajda said.",
            "The Polish government is negotiating with potential partners about financing the project. Piotr Naimski, secretary of state and plenipotentiary of the Polish government for strategic energy infrastructure,  said recently: “We are talking about large amounts of money, but to be managed by the Polish state.”",
            "Poland wants to build from 6,000 to 9,000 MW of installed nuclear capacity based on proven, large-scale, pressurised water reactor technology. Commercial operation of a first unit in a proposed set of six is planned for 2033.",
            "Offers have been submitted by France’s state-owned EDF and South Korea’s Korea Hydro Nuclear Power, a subsidiary of state-owned Korea Electric Power Corporation. A bid from US company Westinghouse is expected by the end of September. ",
            "Mr Gajda, who also serves as secretary-general of the Polish Nuclear Society and in the board of directors of European Nuclear Society, said three factors could be decisive when Poland makes a decision: who will offer the better funding package and model; the level of participation of Polish industry so that as much investment as possible stays in Poland; and cooperation between suppliers. ",
            "“Regardless of which technology we choose, all three suppliers will participate in this project,” he said. “For example, consider the [Barakah nuclear power station] project in the United Arab Emirates, which was implemented by South Korea. Westinghouse has been involved there”. ",
            "Westinghouse provided technical assistance and licensing work for the Barakah project and has signed support agreements with Barakah operator Nawah Energy. Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) agreed recently with Westinghouse to explore ways to cooperate on international nuclear power generation markets, with South Korea saying it plans to export 10 nuclear power plants by 2030.",
            "Mr Gajda said nuclear projects carry “geopolitical weight” and he believes that for this reason Poland does not want China and Russia involved in the project, despite fact that that they are very active in new-build projects around the world, especially in emerging markets like the Middle East or Africa. He said China and Russia offer good financing conditions, but in exchange for influence or access to raw materials and other elements. “It is a new variation of colonialism in a sense,” he said, adding “it is important to be associated with a partner that is politically credible”.",
            "Another challenge Poland faces is the need to build up human resources for the licensing of planned reactors. Mr Gajda said Warsaw has about two years to build up staff, but the Polish Atomic Energy Agency has “already taken steps to strengthen personnel”. This year it increased its budget for staff with reactor assessment tasks.",
            "Poland’s bullishness on nuclear is also seen in the fact that a number of large Polish enterprises have signed agreements on small modular reactors, which they see as to help decarbonise the energy sector. Synthos Green Energy, PKN Orlen and KGHM have all announced plans to deploy SMRs, with the first unjit scheduled to be built in 2029. ",
            "Mr Gajda said: “I believe in SMR technology, but not in the dates given by the companies.” ",
            "He said the most advanced technology is US-based NuScale’s with the Carbon Free Power Project in Idaho. “They’ve already got a site report filed and they’re supposed to apply for a construction licence in early 2024” he said. “So, they are many steps ahead of the Polish projects. The CFPP project is scheduled be operational in 2030.”",
            "Mr Gajda said estimated capital expenditure for the first NuScale BWRX-300 SMR in Poland of €1.1bn is “optimistic”. He said “nobody knows how much SMRs – or large-scale nuclear plants – will cost, but this uncertainty is much greater in projects that haven’t built a prototype yet”.  ",
            "“We see what is happening on international markets in terms of the prices of materials and these are elements that will affect projects.”",
            "Component manufacturers point to rising prices for electricity and materials such as steel. In addition, the recovery of global economies from the Covid-19 pandemic means there is a shortage of raw materials, a situation that has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. "

            "The NEI’s estimate only includes utilities that already operate nuclear plants but there is a “growing list” of utilities who are new to nuclear and demonstrating interest in advanced technologies, Ms Korsnick said.",
            "According to Ms Korsnick, the US Department of Energy (DOE) loan programmes office is working on several applications for nuclear projects in the US while the US Export-Import Bank is working to mobilise funding for overseas customers.",
            "“The overall opportunity is massive,” she said and added: “According to one estimate, revenues for US companies alone could be worth up to $1.9tn in exports over the next 30 years.”",

            "“We need to get on with it, and a natural process of improvement will bring costs down,” she said while also noting that SMRs could have their costs controlled by being manufactured in a factory setting.",
            "According to Ms Korsnick, nuclear power is the key to a zero-carbon future and will pair with renewable sources like wind and solar.",
            "“We already know that nuclear energy is the most reliable, scalable, carbon-free option we have. But, if we are content with our current pace, these aggressive plans to decarbonise will remain just that: plans,” she said.",
            "The NEI is seeing a momentum at the US federal and state level as a testament to the value of the existing nuclear fleet and the industry’s progress on next-generation technology.",
            "In Februrary, the Biden administration launched a $6bn nuclear credits programme aimed at preserving the existing US fleet of nuclear power reactors. A bipartisan infrastructure law created the programme, allowing owners or operators of commercial reactors to apply for certification and bid on credits to help support their continued operations.",
            "The DOE’s national nuclear laboratories are also cooperating closely with the private sector to further development of advanced and modular reactors while grant-based funding gets provided under various innovation programmes.",

            "Converting 5,000 – 7,000 coal plant units globally between 2030 and 2050 (250 – 350 per year) will require a “redesigned delivery model” that has to de-risk the construction process, the riskiest part of a project.",
            "This means providing coal plant owners and investors with high-certainty schedules and budgets. Purpose-built automated tools can achieve rapid, repeatable, and confident project and planning assessments. ",
            "TerraPraxis has assembled a consortium of partners including Bryden Wood, Microsoft, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and University at Buffalo, along with a consortium of global utilities, to launch the ‘Repowering Coal’ initiative. The aim is to provide standardised, pre-licensed designs supported by automated project development and design tools to enable customers to be ready to start construction on their SMR projects in the late 2020s.",
            "Bryden Wood, a UK-based design and engineering firm, has created a new design and construction solution that the group says would make such a programme possible at scale and speed, in part by deploying a new digital platform.",
            "“The result of this repowering will be carbon-free power plants that are cheaper to operate than before, and to ensure continuity for communities reliant on these plants for energy, jobs, and continued economic development,” Eric Ingersoll, co-founder and managing partner of TerraPraxis said.",
            "Kirsty Gogan, co-founder and managing partner of TerraPraxis, said that by sustaining permanent high-quality jobs for communities, repowered coal plants reduce the negative impacts on communities to public and political support for a just transition. ",
            "“The challenge is not only to build enough clean electricity generation to power the world, but to do so quickly while building the infrastructure required to decarbonise end-use sectors such as heat, industry, and transport,” she said at the Nuclear Innovation Conference in Amsterdam.",
            "Grogan said the plan is to replace the existing coal plant boiler with a standardised advanced heat source (AHS) that fits into a standardised facility. A new heat transfer and storage system will run between the existing coal plant and the AHS, which is itself in two parts: the reactor within a modular, component-based enclosure, and another enclosure with support systems. A modular heat transfer system and associated energy storage will allow the plant to efficiently match reactor output with generation demand.”",
            "There will be regulatory challenges to repurposing coal plants. They vary widely and developing a new SMR design for each plant would be complex, costly, and slow. Rather than thousands of individual projects, TerraPraxis’ aim is to develop a unified approach where the design is simplified and standardised to make this plan a reality as quickly as possible.",
            "Gogan said: “Our building system is designed to reduce regulatory scope by firstly separating the power island from the heat island via thermal energy storage. ",
            "“This means that no accident propagation is possible from the power island to the heat island, and that the power island has no nuclear safety requirements. ",
            "Secondly, safety by design characteristics of the advanced heat sources means that safety is achieved with no active safety systems. This reduces complexity and means that all safety-related systems can be combined in one reactor building.”",
            "The relatively small reactor building, assembled from pre-fabricated components, therefore becomes the only safety-related building. “As part of their initial license review, the regulator will have already reviewed this exact configuration and its associated building designs,” Gogan said.",
            "According to TerraPraxis, the world has more than 2 TW of coal-fired electric power plants, adding roughly 12 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions per year. These annual emissions amount to almost one-third of global total forecast net annual emissions of 38.8 Gt/year.",
            "Some policymakers, climate modelers and activists assume that countries will simply shut down their coal plants to reduce carbon emissions. However, because more than half of coal plants worldwide are less than 14 years old, it is unrealistic to expect such young assets to simply retire, especially considering growing energy demand and supply shortages.",
            "“Even in countries with relatively old coal plants, such as the US, Canada and Europe, closing coal plants is difficult and controversial because the loss of jobs and revenues can be devastating for communities, and utilities continue to value the reliable electricity generated,” TerraPraxis says.",
            "In Wyoming, the largest state producer of coal in the US, roughly 80% of electricity production comes from coal-fired power plants that have been steadily declining in terms of their output, but also closing down, since the mid-2000.",
            "Late last year, as part of a project involving companies run by billionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, a retiring coal plant site in Kemmerer, Wyoming, was chosen as the preferred location for a new generation Natrium nuclear power reactor.",
            "US-based reactor developer TerraPower said it had chosen the Kemmerer location, near the Naughton coal power plant about 100 km northeast of Salt Lake City, following an extensive evaluation process and meetings with community members and leaders. It said the new plant could be in operation by 2028.",
            "By locating the Natrium reactor near the retiring Naughton coal plant, TerraPower can take advantage of the existing energy infrastructure that is in place –cooling water and transmission, for example – and also the workforce.",
            "US-based SMR developer NuScale Power has said building SMRs at the “considerable” number of fossil fuel and coal plants that will be going out of service towards the end of the decade and beyond means workers can be cross-trained and millions of dollars saved by using existing infrastructure.",
            "“The infrastructure is all there and we can save about $100m by using it,” chief executive officer John Hopkins said. “We are in talks with a couple of potential customers.”",
            "NuScale conducted a study in the US which estimated that, on average, approximately $100m of existing coal plant infrastructure such the plant’s cooling water delivery systems, site fire protection and existing transmission system connection could be reused for a NuScale plant. The company has also signed a number of agreements for potential SMR deployment in Europe, including coal sites in Poland."

It adds: “The question of how we will move towards this system is still largely open.”",
            "The plan says nuclear power can contribute to diversification and, unlike wind and solar, offers regulated, baseload power. A study being carried out by the government analysis the relationship between different types of CO2-free power and how nuclear power can be integrated into the energy mix. ",

            "The situation in Ukraine is “just the tip of the iceberg” when it comes to the energy landscape in Europe, he warned. He said that for many years policymakers have been taking security of supply for granted. “We have lived in an era of oversupply.”",
            "Given Europe’s energy situation, and the bloc’s efforts to reduce its dependence on outside sources such as Russia, nucleareurope, which represents nearly 3,000 European companies working in the industry, intends to focus on highlighting the solutions nuclear energy can bring. ",
            "These include providing a stable, affordable and low-carbon source of electricity, contributing to the production of low-carbon hydrogen and focussing on innovation, in particular the development of small modular reactors.",
            "Nuclear’s ‘Key Role’ In Shift From Russia",
            "Ukraine, and the fact that Russia is Europe’s main supplier of crude oil, natural gas and solid fossil fuels, remains the thorniest issue. The European commission has said nuclear will have a role to play as the EU strives to shift away from its reliance on Russia, with fossil-free hydrogen, notably nuclear-based, also playing a part in substituting natural gas.",
            "The commission said in a communication on its “REPowerEU” plan that Russia’s “unprovoked and unjustified” military aggression against Ukraine has massively disrupted the world’s energy system. In March 2022 EU leaders agreed to phase out Europe’s dependency on Russian energy imports “as soon as possible”. In May, they agreed to embargo most Russian oil imports into the bloc by year-end as part of new sanctions on Moscow.",
            "nucleareurope sees a key role for the bloc’s 104 nuclear power plants, which provide about 25% of its electricity, as it strives to cut Russian imports. It said that “as rightly pointed out in the plan”, stopping the phaseout of nuclear power plants can help to reduce the EU’s dependence on Russian gas. ",
            "“Furthermore, the commission makes clear that this will also bring economic benefits, as it will lead to lower investment costs, Mr Desbazeille said. “Given this, we firmly believe that one of the best ways of ensuring security of supply and lower investment costs today is to keep as many nuclear power plants running for as long as possible.”",
            "nucleareurope has warned, however, that this only provides a solution in the relatively short term. If the EU really is committed to a long-term, stable and affordable supply of low-carbon energy, more needs to be done to support the development of new nuclear projects, including small modular reactors (SMRs). “The shift towards increased electrification and greater use of low-carbon hydrogen will require vast amounts of low carbon energy,” it said. “And this energy needs to be produced in Europe.”",
            "Europe should also consider increasing its reliance on nuclear power as it seeks to limit increases in energy prices brought about by last year’s surge in wholesale energy prices and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, nucleareurope said.",
            "According to Mr Desbazeille, nuclear can have a positive impact on reducing energy prices because nuclear production costs remain stable – thanks to low operating costs and the low impact of potential variations in the price of uranium, which accounts for only around 5% of total operating costs.",
            "“Given that nuclear reactors have a constant capacity factor of between 80-90%, this can ensure energy market stability both in terms of prices and grid operation,” he said.",
            "“Even if most of the uranium needed for the EU’s nuclear fleet is imported, unlike fossil fuels, the diversity of the suppliers provides enough alternatives in cases where one supplier is unavailable, even if the market is rather limited.”",
            "According to nucleareurope, maintaining the current nuclear fleet will help achieve 2030 decarbonistion targets and guarantee Europe’s security of supply.",
            "The potential development of commercial nuclear power reactors to produce green hydrogen is another area nucleareurope sees as critical.",
            "Policies Needed For Green Hydrogen",
            "Green hydrogen is in the news because initiatives have begun to transmit electricity produced by a nuclear plant – or another low-carbon energy facility such as solar – to electrolysers, which would produce green hydrogen for industry, transport and home heating, at the sites where the hydrogen is needed. ",
            "The technology is reasonably mature, but remains expensive. Proponents say it can be commercialised for large-scale consumer use – possibly within years – to help bring about the transition to a zero-carbon hydrogen-based economy without the need for fossil fuels.",
            "nucleareurope says the low-carbon production of hydrogen from nuclear power plants could help Europe reach its climate goals, but the EU needs to put in place the right policy incentives to expand development of the emerging technology.",
            "“For the production of green hydrogen nuclear will be needed because electrolysers [needed as part of the production process] have to run 24/7, not only when renewable generation is available,” Mr Desbazeille said. “Electrolysers are not flexibly operated facilities They depend on baseload power. ",
            "“Where is this stable decarbonised power going to come from, especially when coupled with the retirement of fossil-fired plants? For me, with hydrogen, the nuclear case is even stronger.”",
            "Another area of focus for nucleareurope will be the development of new generation reactor technology, including SMRs. ",
            "There is significant impetus for SMRs, which can be factory assembled and deployed wherever they are needed – for remote communities, ports, mines and industry.",
            "Governments and private sector companies in a number of European countries planning development and deployment, with the first unts scheduled to operate by the end of the decade. ",
            "Belgium has allocated €100m for research, France’s president Emanuel Macron has called for an SMR by the end of the decade (he also wants to see 14 large-scale reactors), Romania and Latvia have signed SMR agreements and Poland is working on a number of projects.",
            "The need for nuclear – whether it is for baseload, hydrogen or as backup for intermittent renewables – means it is of primary importance that Europe’s nuclear reactor fleet is allowed the investment for long-term operation [LTO], Mr Desbazeille said. “This is a crucial topic to put back in the conversation because we are certain that LTO is a ‘no regret’ option that should be highlighted as such in the energy debate. It is something which is totally ignored in the debate today; it feels like the elephant in the room.”",
            "Taxonomy: Key Vote Looms",
            "Another elephant in the room, and one which is likely to occupy a significant amount of nucleareurope’s lobbying power, is Europe’s sustainable finance taxonomy.",
            "European lawmakers are gearing up for a July vote which could confirm, or put paid to, EU commission plans to classify nuclear energy projects as sustainable investments until 2030.",
            "The taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through complementary delegated acts – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight.",
            "In February, the European commission officially put forward regulations to label nuclear energy as sustainable under the taxonomy, ending months of uncertainty and wrangling over whether the industry would have a significant place in the bloc’s transition to zero carbon.",
            "The legislation means that under certain conditions nuclear will be labelled as a “green” energy source that could contribute to Europe’s transition to climate neutrality.",
            "Ten 10 EU countries have spoken out in support of nuclear power, saying it is “absolutely essential” it is included in the taxonomy. Ministers from Germany, Austria, Portugal, Denmark and Luxembourg said they are against the inclusion of nuclear, with Austria saying it will go to court to prevent nuclear being part of the taxonomy rules. ",
            "A simple majority vote in parliament – at least 353 MEPs – can still block the current proposal in July. According to sources in Europe, so far the Socialists & Democrats, the Left and the Greens, which together hold 256 seats, have committed to blocking the proposal.",
            "In May, a group of 16 MEPs from groups representing a majority of the European Parliament drafted a motion to block the inclusion of gas and nuclear, but the overall level of support is still unclear.",
            "The European nuclear industry welcomed the decision to include nuclear in the taxonomy, but warned that some of the conditions it needs to meet, such as those governing radwaste disposal plans and accident tolerant fuel, will prove challenging.",
            "“We remain disappointed that nuclear continues to be treated as a transitional technology,” Mr Desbazeille said. “We believe it contributes to climate mitigation objectives and does not cause more harm than any other power-producing technology already considered as taxonomy compliant.”"

            "Both designs include a passively cooled microreactor module, a power conversion module, and a control module, each housed in a shipping container ready for air, sea, or ground transport. A fourth container could be used to house ancillary equipment, such as pipes, cables, and connectors.",
            "BWXT said reactor core and associated control systems are designed to maintain safety under all conditions, while the fuel has been tested and verified to temperatures far exceeding operating conditions.",
            "The transportable design consists of several modules and the entire reactor system is designed to be assembled onsite and become operational within 72 hours. Shutdown, cooldown, disconnection and removal for transport is designed to occur in less than seven days.",

Mobile military microreactors have been suggested as an alternative to the diesel generators often used to supply electricity to army operations because they could eliminate the need for expensive and hazardous transports of diesel fuel to remote locations or forward operating bases.",
            "According to the US Energy Information Administraton, the DOD consumes around 30 TWh of electricity a year and more than 10 million gallons (45 million litres) of fuel a day. Military operational projections predict that energy demand will continue to increase significantly over the next few years.",
            "The EIA says more sustainable methods are needed to provide energy for the military. Inherent dangers, logistical complexities, and the high cost of sustaining power demands at forward operating bases and remote operating bases using diesel generators continue to constrain operations and planning.",
            "Technologies currently under development, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, new radar systems, new weapon systems, and the electrification of the non-tactical vehicle fleet, will require even more energy.",

            "She said there is competition in the advanced nuclear reactor market, but the “appetite is strong”, driven by the need for decarbonisation and the fact that a plant can be manufactured and installed “in a matter of weeks”. ",
            "The LFR offers fuel cycle flexibility that is typical of fast reactors, Ms Baranwal said. “This is important because there are many entities and end-users that are curious about used fuel and its storage. The HFR can close the fuel cycle and this is a benefit for end-users.”",
            "Ms Baranwal also said Westinghouse’s eVinci microreactor, a 5-10 MW unit, is “progressing through a development and tesing programme” and attracting interest from defence organisations, universities and remote communities that are relying on “exorbitantly expensive diesel given the geopolitics of where we sit today”.",

According to Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, a 190-MW IMSR is one of four projects in an invitation process to host Canada's first small modular reactor.*",
            "The IMSR plant operates at high temperatures (600-700 degrees Celsius) and is said to be 50% more efficient than traditional reactors. It uses a graphite moderator and standard assay low-enriched uranium fuel with the same level of enrichment (less than 5% U-235) as in conventional nuclear plants.",

            "Mr Desbazeille told the conference it is clear that the situation in Ukraine is “just the tip of the iceberg” when it comes to the energy landscape in Europe.",
            "“We’ve had clear signals over the last 18 months in Europe that the energy crisis – reflected by increasing prices – was looming,” he said. “We will continue to navigate through this crisis as best we can. However, we must also actively take lessons from it. Europe must become less dependent on external sources of energy.”",
            "Highlighting The Advantages Of Nuclear",
            "Given Europe’s energy situation, and the bloc’s efforts to reduce its dependence on outside sources such as Russia, nucleareurope will now focus on highlighting the solutions which the nuclear energy sector can bring. ",
            "These include providing a stable, affordable and low-carbon source of electricity, contributing to the production of low-carbon hydrogen and focussing on innovation, in particular the development of small modular reactors.",
            "Mr Desbazeille called on industry, policymakers, stakeholders to “work together for our future. Let’s sit around a table and come up with practical solutions to fighting climate change and to improve Europe’s energy independence.”",
            "Established in 1960, the Forum Atomique Européen – as it was known then – has seen many changes over the last 62 years. For example, the number of issues tackled by the sector has shifted from the “pure” nuclear topics such as the Euratom Treaty, radioactive waste management and innovation, to a broader range of issues which include climate change, environmental matters, sustainability and security of supply. “Hence the importance of having a strong nuclear representation in Brussels,” a statement said. ",
            "nucleareurope said its membership is composed of 15 national nuclear associations and six corporate members. As a result, it represents nearly 3,000 European companies working in the industry which support more than one million jobs."

            "Each of the initial run of reactors is expected to have a generation capacity of 470 MW, or enough to power the equivalent of 1.3m UK homes, and cost about £2.2bn per unit, dropping to £1.8bn by the time five have been completed. This means it will be comparable with offshore wind at around £50/MWh. A single SMR power station will occupy the footprint of two football pitches."

            "Asked whether Jordan intended to produce large quantities of uranium for commercial purposes, Mr Shunnaq said: “Yes, that is possible. We will first embark on the large-scale treatment of thousands of tons of uranium ore, conduct feasibility studies, and then evaluate the commercial aspect of such operations.”",
            "Mr Shunnaq said Jordan will send the yellowcake it produces abroad for enrichment and then use it to fuel its nuclear reactors.",
            "Production of yellowcake is an intermediate step in the processing of uranium ores. It is a step in the processing of uranium after it has been mined, but before fuel fabrication or uranium enrichment.",
            "Jordan does not have any commercial nuclear plants, but said last year it had completed the geological work and determined the level of uranium oxide reserves in the country’s central regions as it pushes ahead with a three-point plan for the development of the nuclear energy sector.",
            "Khaled Toukan, chairman of the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission told state-controlled Jordan News Agency (Petra) that uranium exploration is one of the three projects of the country’s nuclear programme. The others are the Jordan nuclear research and training reactor, which entered service in 2016, and a nuclear power plant project for electricity production and seawater desalination.",
            "The research reactor is a 5MW (th) multipurpose plant on the campus of Jordan University of Science and Technology in Ar Ramtha city in northern Jordan.",
            "Arab News reported that in 2015, Jordan had signed an agreement with Russia to build a $10 bn nuclear power station with a capacity of about 2,000 MW. But in May 2018, Jordan announced a plan for a small modular nuclear reactor with Russia, replacing the original $10bn deal.",
            "In 2018 state news agency Petra quoted Mr Toukan as saying Jordan had not abandoned a project to build its first commercial nuclear power plant, but had pulled out of a possible deal with Russia to build the facility because of the high cost."

            "According to the NEA, the long-term operation of existing nuclear plants could save 49.2 gigatonnes in cumulative emissions from 2020-2050. For new builds of large Generation III reactors the figure is 22.8 Gt and for small modular reactors it is 15.1 Gt. The totals are for projected emissions saved while producing electricity, heat and hydrogen.",
            "The NEA called on the nuclear sector to understand and reduce the costs of new nuclear. It said there are key “enabling conditions” for success that the nuclear energy sector and policymakers should address in the areas of system costs, project timelines, public confidence and clean energy financing. ",
            "According to the report, a systems approach is needed to understand the full costs of electricity provision and to ensure that markets value the benefits of nuclear, which include low-carbon baseload electricity, dispatchability, and reliability.",
            "The NEA said all credible models show that nuclear energy has an important role to play in global climate change mitigation efforts. However, despite clear analyses from many sources, including the NEA, that point to the need for a massive, “all-the-above” approach that includes nuclear energy, some multinational activities, financial institutions, and policy makers avoid discussion of nuclear energy. ",
            "“This dynamic is deeply problematic to the cause of carbon reductions,” the report says. “All low-carbon technologies, including nuclear energy must be included in discussions about the energy transition in order to maintain the integrity and evidence base of the policy dialogue. ",
            "“Without a significant contribution from nuclear energy, the prospects for meeting Paris targets will be significantly lower.” The International Energy Agency estimates that it would cost the world an estimated $1.6 trillion more to meet Paris targets without nuclear energy. “Ultimately, even this estimate may prove optimistic,” the NEA report says.",
            "According to the NEA, the nuclear energy sector can support future climate change mitigation efforts in a variety of ways. Existing global installed nuclear energy capacity is already playing a role and its long-term operation can enable the existing fleet to continue making a contribution for decades to come. ",
            "There is also significant potential for large-scale Generation III nuclear new builds to provide non-emitting electricity in existing and embarking nuclear power jurisdictions, in particular to replace coal power.",
            "Perhaps even more importantly, a wave of near-term and medium-term nuclear innovation has the potential to open up new opportunities with advanced and small modular reactors, some of which are expected to be on the market before the end of this decade."

            "MIT estimates the overnight capital cost for Vogtle-3 and -4 at $7,956/kW. It estimates the overnight capital cost of the next AP1000 in the US to be $4,300/kW and $2,900/kW for the 10th unit in series, based on 2018 dollars.",
            "The report estimates the median first-of-a-kind (FOAK) overnight cost of a plant architecture that resembles an AP1000 at about $4,300/kW.",
            "The overnight cost is essentially the construction costs excluding financing costs and not taking into account the lifespan of a plant or its key components. The MIT report focuses on the design architecture of the plant and does not take into account areas such as construction execution and the supply chain.",
            "The “should costs” could be higher because of “unique” post-Covid inflation and increases in material index costs, the report says.",

This is due to AP1000 reliance on passive safety. ",

            "The repot notes that small modular reactor overnight costs per kWe are estimated to be 1.4-1.75 higher than the cost of the next AP1000 plant because of the lack of economy of scale.",

            "It says before the fracking boom that led to low price of natural gas, the AP1000 was primed to be a major nuclear technology with over 20 units under operation by this decade. ",
            "However, the availability of cheaper alternative energy sources along with FOAK cost experience and schedule delays with the AP1000, particularly in the US, have led to only two plants being currently under construction at the Vogtle site in the US. According to the report, Vogtle had a price tag of $28bn as of July 2021.",
            "Four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors are already in commercial operation at Sanmen and Haiyang in China. Construction of the first, Sanmen-1, began in April 2009 with commercial operation in September 2018. The most recent, Haiyang-2, began commercial operation in January 2019.",
            "The FOAK Chinese design civil work proved to be constructible with the civil work for Haiyang-2 was finished in less than four years. The main source of delays in Chinese AP1000 designs were the reactor coolant pumps that were FOAK technologies and were also subjected to complex export control scope. ",
            "As such, the next AP1000 plant has the potential to provide a viable product in the US and oversees if its original NOAK capital cost and construction schedule projections by Westinghouse can be realised.",

            "NuScale, based in Oregon, announced plans in December to go public by way of a merger with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp, with the aim to establish a new entity called NuScale Power Corporation.",
            "Last month NuScale said it had secured $10m in investment from California-based investment advisory firm SailingStone Capital Partners.",
            "NuScale said the purpose of the merger is to create “a first-of-its-kind energy company poised to power the global energy transition by delivering safe, scalable and reliable carbon-free nuclear power”.",
            "According to NuScale, Nucor is the largest and most diversified steel and steel products company in North America. Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, Nucor has more than 300 operating facilities and is also North America’s largest recycler, processing approximately 20 million toes of ferrous scrap annually to produce new steel that is 100% recyclable at the end of its useful life.",
            "Nucor president and chief executive officer Leon Topalian said sustainability is driving the business decisions of leading companies and as America’s largest steel producer and a significant energy consumer, “we are looking for safe and reliable sources of power generation that are consistent with our sustainability goals”. He said: “The continued development of small modular nuclear reactors is critical to ensure our nation has carbon-free, baseload power, which is why we are making this investment in NuScale.”",
            "In December 2021, NuScale announced the rebranding of its SMR portfolio and introduced the official Voygr name. The flagship project will be the Voygr-12 scalable power plant design, which can accommodate up to 12 power modules, resulting in a total gross output of 924 MW.",
            "NuScale also offers smaller scalable power plant solutions – the four-module Voygr-4 (308 MW) and six-module Voygr-6 (462 MW).",
            "The company said it can deliver the first Voygr power plant to a customer as soon as 2027, subject to customer needs and supported by its established supply chain partners.",
            "In August 2020, the NuScale SMR became the first and so far only SMR to receive design approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, In July 2021, the NRC published the proposed rule that would certify the NuScale design – a crucial step towards the construction and deployment of the SMR technology.",
            "NuScale and Fluor are working for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (Uamps) to bring what could be the world’s first SMR project to commercialisation.",
            "Uamps is scheduled to submit a construction licence application in 2023, and is aiming to start commercial operation of the first module in 2029."

            "The report says climate change has already caused “substantial damages and increasingly irreversible losses, in terrestrial, freshwater and coastal and open ocean marine ecosystems”. It warns that approximately 50-75% of the global population could be exposed to periods of “life-threatening climatic conditions” due to extreme heat and humidity by 2100.",
            "It says increasing weather and climate extreme events “have exposed millions of people to acute food insecurity and reduced water security”, with the most significant impacts seen in parts of Africa, Asia, Central and South America, small islands and the Arctic. Climate change and extreme weather events “will significantly increase ill health and premature deaths from the near- to long-term”.",
            "Commenting on the report, UN secretary-general António Guterres described it as “an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership”.",
            "Calling on all G20 governments to “dismantle their coal fleets”, Mr Guterres warned that “as current events make all too clear, our continued reliance on fossil fuels makes the global economy and energy security vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and crises”.",
            "However, there is increasing evidence of climate action, said scientists. Since 2010, there have been sustained decreases of up to 85% in the costs of solar and wind energy, and batteries. An increasing range of policies and laws have enhanced energy efficiency, reduced rates of deforestation and accelerated the deployment of renewable energy.",
            "The report warns that in 2010-2019 average annual global greenhouse gas emissions were at their highest levels in human history, but the rate of growth has slowed. ",
            "It quotes scientific literature that says multiple energy supply options are available to reduce emissions over the next decade, including nuclear power and hydropower, which are “established technologies”.",
            "The IPCC labels nuclear as a low-carbon source and says nuclear generation grew 9% between 2015 and 2019 and accounted for 10% of total generation in 2019. But it warns that the adoption of nuclear energy has been slower than the growth rates anticipated in some pathways to net zero.",
            "The contribution of nuclear could be enhanced by a new generation of reactors including small modular reactors.",
            "UN chief António Guterres said continued reliance on fossil fuels makes the global economy and energy security vulnerable to geopolitical shocks.",
            "The reports quotes researchers who concluded that lower emissions sources of energy, including nuclear, renewables, and some biofuels, could be essential in all pathways.",
            "“We are at a crossroads,” said IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee. “The decisions we make now can secure a liveable future. We have the tools and know-how required to limit warming.",
            "“I am encouraged by climate action being taken in many countries. There are policies, regulations and market instruments that are proving effective. If these are scaled up and applied more widely and equitably, they can support deep emissions reductions and stimulate innovation.”",
            "The report concludes that the world has options in all sectors to at least halve emissions by 2030, but limiting global warming will require major transitions in the energy sector. This will involve a substantial reduction in fossil fuel use, widespread electrification, improved energy efficiency, and use of alternative fuels such as hydrogen, which can be produced by nuclear reactors.",
            "“Having the right policies, infrastructure and technology in place to enable changes to our lifestyles and behaviour can result in a 40-70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This offers significant untapped potential,” said IPCC Working Group III co-chair Priyadarshi Shukla. “The evidence also shows that these lifestyle changes can improve our health and wellbeing.”",
            "In the scenarios assessed in the report, limiting warming to around 1.5°C (2.7°F) requires global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by 43% by 2030; at the same time, methane would also need to be reduced by about a third. ",
            "“Even if we do this, it is almost inevitable that we will temporarily exceed this temperature threshold but could return to below it by the end of the century,” the report says.",
            "“It’s now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F),” said said IPCC Working Group III co-chair Jim Skea. “Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.”",
            "The report was the third and final section of the IPCC’s latest comprehensive review of climate science, drawing on the work of thousands of scientists. IPCC reports take about seven years to compile."

            "The Financial Times reported that Wylfa, on Anglesey in north Wales, could get three new nuclear reactors as Mr Johnson is said to be “enthusiastic” about accelerating plans in order to reach the UK’s future net-zero targets and increase energy security.",
            "Hitachi subsidiary Horizon was planning to build two UK advanced boiling water reactor units at Wylfa, but announced last year it had officially withdrawn its application for planning permission for the construction and operation of the station and associated infrastructure, citing problems with financing.",
            "In October 2021, the government announced funding of £1.7bn in EDF Energy’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station project in Suffolk, southeast England, as it pushes to replace the country’s aging reactor fleet. EDF is leading efforts to build two EPR units at Sizewell C. ",
            "In January government ministers added further support to Sizewell C with a £100m investment to help develop the project while the company looks for private investors.",
            "Electricity demand is also expected to rise steadily in the next decade, meaning large investments in new power stations would be required just to keep the share of nuclear constant, let alone increase it to a record level of just over a quarter of electricity use.",
            "Also present at the meeting were a series of big pension companies and insurers, including Aviva, Legal & General and Rothesay Life, alongside major foreign investors including Australia’s Macquarie and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Ministers have wrestled for years with how to attract private capital to invest in nuclear – but companies have been hesitant to put pension and insurance cash at risk.",
            "The government is considering changes to insurance rules set by the EU and copied by the UK to make it easier for insurers and pensions to invest. The UK is also switching to a regulated asset base (RAB) model, which it hopes will give long-term investors more certainty on returns, a change it hopes will address limitations to the current rules.",
            "After the meeting, Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the London-based Nuclear Industry Association said accelerating nuclear projects is absolutely essential to keep energy costs down, cut expensive gas imports and strengthen the country’s energy security as it moves towards net zero. “That means urgently investing in a fleet of large and small nuclear stations, alongside renewable investment, to deliver the clean, sovereign power we need.”",
            "Mr Johnson said recently the country must make “big new bets” on developing new nuclear power stations to end the nation’s “addiction” to Russian oil and gas.",
            "Mr Johnson is due to unveil an energy security strategy later this month which will set out how the country will achieve energy independence.",
            "The document will have a major focus on increasing the roll-out of renewable energy sources as the government remains committed to its net zero emissions by 2050 target.",
            "But it will also push for the development of more nuclear power capability, including through small modular reactors as well as larger power stations.",
            "Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson said Russia’s president Vladimir Putin knew when he launched his invasion of Ukraine that “the world would find it very hard to punish him” because he had “created an addiction” to Russian energy.",
            "Mr Johnson said “we cannot go on like this” as he repeated his calls for the West to wean itself off Russian oil and gas.",
            "He said green energy is “invulnerable to Putin’s manipulations” but “we also need baseload energy – power that can be relied upon when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing”.",
            "“So now is the time to make a series of big new bets on nuclear power,” he said."

            "In October 2021, Westinghouse and Canadian utility Bruce power published the results of a study according to which the microreactor is expected to be between 14% and 44% more economic than a diesel generator – presenting a significant opportunity to power the remote areas largely reliant on fossil fuels today.",
            "In December 2021, Westinghouse submitted a regulatory engagement plant for the eVinci to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The document, which is a roadmap for the interaction and communication between the regulator and applicant regarding licensing, is the first step in the regulatory licensing process."

The “repeatable” nature of factory construction lowers cost, reduces uncertainty and risk for developers and crucially, allows countries to address their urgent need for low carbon energy, Rolls-Royce said.",
            "The GDA process is expected to take four to five years, during which time, Rolls-Royce SMR will engage in a range of parallel activities, including factory development, siting and commercial discussions.",

            "The government will match the consortium’s investment, which is set to receive a second phase top-up of £50m from Rolls-Royce, with £210m to help roll out the SMRs as part of the government’s green 10-point plan, announced in December 2020, to kickstart the green economy over the next decade.",
            "The 10-point plan included investing £525m to help develop large and smaller-scale nuclear plants, and research and develop new advanced modular reactors.",
            "The new Rolls-Royce SMR business, which will continue to look for further investment, will now push ahead with identifying sites for the factories which will manufacture the modules that enable onsite assembly of the power plants.",
            "Discussions will continue with the government on long-term investment in the project. “Rolls-Royce SMR is engaging with export customers across many continents who need this technology to meet their own net zero commitments,” a statement said.",

            "Each of the initial run of reactors is expected to have a generation capacity of 470 MW, or enough to power the equivalent of 1.3m UK homes, and cost about £2.2bn per unit dropping to £1.8bn by the time five have been completed. This means it will be comparable with offshore wind at around £50/MWh. A single SMR power station will occupy the footprint of two football pitches.",
            "Rolls-Royce said the potential for this to be a leading global export for the UK is unprecedented. Nine-tenths of an individual Rolls-Royce SMR power plant will be built or assembled in factory conditions and around 80% could be delivered by a UK supply chain.",
            "Much of the venture’s investment is expected to be focused in the north of the UK, where there is significant existing nuclear expertise.",

            "The DOD is looking to reduce its reliance on local electric grids and diesel-fuelled generators at military installations. Project Pele is designed to develop a Generation IV nuclear reactor of up to 5MW, which, once prototyped, could pave the way for commercial adoption of such technologies.",
            "In March 2021, the DOD announced that it had selected two of three teams in a preliminary design competition to move ahead with the development of a final design of a prototype mobile microreactor capable of producing 1-5 MW. ",
            "The designs – submitted by BWXT Advanced Technologies and X-energy – are both for small, high-temperature gas-cooled reactors using high-assay low-enriched uranium (Haleu) Triso fuel. One of the two companies could soon be selected to build a prototype reactor during a 24-­month construction and demonstration phase.",
            "Both designs include a passively cooled microreactor module, a power conversion module, and a control module, each housed in a shipping container ready for air, sea, or ground transport. A fourth container could be used to house ancillary equipment, such as pipes, cables, and connectors.",
            "Mobile military microreactors have been suggested as an alternative to the diesel generators often used to supply electricity to Army operations because they could eliminate the need for expensive and hazardous transports of diesel fuel to remote locations or forward operating bases.",
            "The Army also requires reliable electricity at large domestic and international bases, and some have suggested that those more established bases would be better suited for microreactor deployments. ",
            "According to the EIA, the DOD consumes around 30 TWh of electricity per year and more than 10 million gallons (45 million litres) of fuel per day. Additionally, military operational projections predict that energy demand will continue to increase significantly over the next few years.",
            "The EIA says the challenge is to develop more sustainable methods to provide reliable, abundant, and continuous energy. Inherent dangers, logistical complexities, and overwhelming costs of sustaining power demands at forward operating bases and remote operating bases using diesel generators continue to constrain operations and fundamental strategic planning. ",
            "Additionally, technologies currently under development, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, new radar systems, new weapon systems, and the electrification of the non-tactical vehicle fleet, will require even greater energy demands. ",
            "A Defense science board, commissioned by the DOD, recommended further engineering development and prototyping of very small modular reactors with an output less than 10 MW. But before this technology can be deployed, a prototype mobile microreactor must be tested to ensure it can meet DOD specifications and requirements."

            "He said reliance on single developers had contributed to the cancellation of recent projects at Wylfa and Moorside. ",
            "The Lords heard that the Bill takes steps to remove barriers to private investment. This will reduce the UK’s reliance on overseas developers for finance and deliver better value for money for consumers. ",
            "Lord Callahan said the effectiveness of the RAB model has been seen in the successful financing of other complex and large infrastructure projects, including the Thames Tideway tunnel and Heathrow airport’s terminal 5. “With nuclear projects, the RAB model has the potential to bring in new sources of capital at a value for money cost to consumers,” he said.",
            "Members of the Lords were discussing the main principles and purpose of the Nuclear Energy (Financing) Bill during its second reading. The bill, which must now be discussed by a committee, will provide finances for new nuclear power stations by introducing the RAB model, which empowers the economic regulator to levy charges on consumers. ",
            "The Lords discussed the main issues in the bill including the criteria nuclear companies would have to meet to qualify for RAB; revenue collection contracts and regulations; establishing a special administration regime for relevant licensee nuclear companies.",
            "By using a RAB model, a company’s investors share some of a project’s risks with consumers. For new nuclear plants this can lower the cost of finance, which is the main driver of project cost. “This could deliver nuclear plants at a lower overall cost to consumers than if we relied on existing funding mechanisms alone,” Lord Callahan said.",

            "This legislation is vital in getting new nuclear projects off the ground and will help the UK meet its decarbonisation targets, Lord Callahan said. As well as contributing to achieving the UK’s net-zero commitments, new nuclear will complement renewable energy to ensure that the country has a resilient, low-cost, low-carbon electricity system for the long term.",
            "Lord Rooker said there is no reason at all why the UK, along with other democratic states, cannot ensure security and stability of nuclear technology and “get control of it itself”. ",
            "He said: “My view is that there should be no finance from China or Russia at all. They cannot be trusted with commercial contracts these days.”",
            "Reports in the UK have said the government and Sizewell C project company EDF want to secure enough new investment to replace Chinese state-controlled CGN, which has a 20% stake in the project. Reports have said the government is looking to push out CGN because of concerns over security.",
            "Prime minister Boris Johnson said recently that he is against “undue influence by potentially adversarial countries” in national infrastructure such as Sizewell C, but does not want to exclude all Chinese investment from the country.",
            "With all but one of the UK’s fleet of 11 nuclear reactors scheduled to close by 2028, representing 85% of its existing nuclear capacity, the need for new nuclear projects is more urgent than ever, Lord Callahan said, adding the Bill is an opportunity to boost this vital sector and its supply chain by getting projects off the ground.",
            "With construction of two EPR plants at Hinkley Point C under way, the government is also aiming to bring at least one large-scale nuclear project to a final investment decision by the end of this parliament, probably the project for two EPR units at Sizewell C.",
            "A recent spending review provided up to £1.7bn of direct government funding to support this objective. The government has also provided further funding to support the development of future nuclear projects, including small modular reactors, led by Rolls-Royce."

            "In a speech earlier this month outlining his plans for low carbon energy, Mr Macron announced that France will build at least six new nuclear plants, consider a further eight and also extend the life of existing plants to 50 years. The country will also invest in small modular reactors, solar and wind.“This is exactly the kind of bold commitment that we at TUSNE want to see the UK government make,” the group said in a statement. “We desperately need to replace our ageing nuclear stations if the UK has any chance of hitting net zero and stopping energy bills from skyrocketing even further.“What’s more, as workers in nuclear communities up and down the country can attest, nuclear provides highly valued, quality jobs – exactly what the government should be aiming for when it talks about levelling up.”",
            "Emmanuel Macron announced last week that he wants to build up to 14 new reactors.TUSNE, which is supported by the major trade unions GMB Union, Unite the Union and Prospect, said that had the UK invested in a nuclear fleet back in 2008 following the Labour government’s nuclear power white paper, it could now be reaping the benefits of multiple new nuclear stations, with yet more nearing completion. “Instead, the piecemeal approach taken to date has resulted in only one station under construction and another proposed,” the statement said.TUSNE said it is “painfully clear” that Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C will not be enough to meet the UK’s climate ambitions and called on the government to re-invigorate new build in the UK.“We need a fleet of stations, much like in France, where thanks to nuclear, they have some of the lowest carbon emissions and cheapest electricity in Europe,” the group said. “They’re the world’s largest net exporter of electricity and make over €3bn per year from it.”Jim Mowatt, chair of TUSNE, said: “Whilst president Macron hails the rebirth of France’s nuclear industry, the UK’s sector is stuck in the doldrums. The science is clear that net zero needs nuclear, and it needs a lot more than the single plant currently being built in the UK.”The UK has 13 operational nuclear reactors, with a shift to new units planned over the coming years to replace the ageing fleet. Thirty-four plants have been shut down permanently and are being decommissioned.Twelve of the country’s nuclear units are advanced gas-cooled reactors and one, at Sizewell B, a pressurised water reactor unit which could operate beyond 2030.If Sizewell B closes as scheduled in 2035, only the two new EPR plants at Hinkley Point C will be operational at that point."

            "KGHM is evaluating NuScale Voygr plants as a way of “repurposing” existing coal plants. The company is also looking at opportunities to deploy Voygr plants to provide energy for its operations and to support other Polish industrial energy users.",
            "A NuScale spokesperson told NucNet that a NuScale plant is similar in power output to an existing coal plant and can fit on the same site and re-use the existing transmission infrastructure, making it an ideal solution for coal plant repurposing.",
            "NuScale conducted a study in the US which estimated that, on average, approximately $100m of existing coal plant infrastructure such the plant’s cooling water delivery systems, site fire protection and existing transmission system connection could be reused for a NuScale SMR.",
            "John Hopkins, NuScale’s chairman and chief executive officer, said the retirement of aging coal-fired power plants is leading to changes in power generation, infrastructure needs, and workforce opportunity.",
            "“NuScale’s SMR technology is an ideal flexible clean energy solution to repurpose retiring coal fuelled power plants and most importantly, retain and retrain the skilled power plant workforce already in place in these Polish communities.”",
            "KGHM could use small modular reactors to power industrial processes such as copper smelting. Photo: KGHM",
            "KGHM president Marcin Chludziński said SMR technology will substantially reduce the company’s operational costs. He said KGHM plans to generate power commercially to help in “the green transformation” of Poland and bring down costs for the average household.",
            "KGHM and NuScale began their collaboration in September 2021, after the two parties signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate in the development, licensing and construction of a NuScale Voygr plant in Poland. ",
            "NuScale’s announcement is the latest in a series of SMR-related developments in Poland. Also in September, NuScale signed a memorandum of understanding with Getka Group and Unitmot to explore the deployment of its SMR at coal-fired power plant sites in Poland.",
            "Synthos Green Energy and ZE Pak said they would work together to explore building GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) BWRX-300 or other US SMRs at the site of the Patnow coal plant about 200 km west of Warsaw.",
            "And in December 2021, Polish state-owned fuels and energy company PKN Orlen and Synthos signed an agreement to establish a joint venture that aims to commercialise microreactor and small modular reactor technologies in Poland and in particular GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s (GEH) BWRX-300.",
            "In the US, NuScale announced earlier this month it has told the Nuclear Regukatory Commission in a letter that it expects to submit a combined licence application (Cola) for the Carbon Free Power Project’s SMR plant in Idaho in January 2024. NuScale’s plant is the first and only SMR so far to receive design approval from the NRC.",
            "NuScale’s factory-fabricated SMRs use a smaller version of larger, pressurised water reactor technology. The scalable designs mean plants can be adapted to the power needs of their location. This reduces the financial commitments associated with gigawatt-sized nuclear facilities, the company said.",
            "The Voygr-12 design can accommodate up to 12 77-MW power modules, resulting in a total gross output of 924 MW. NuScale also offers smaller scalable power plant solutions – the four-module Voygr-4 (308 MW) and six-module Voygr-6 (462 MW).",

Uncertainty surrounds the Bradwell B project with the UK government said to be reconsidering China’s role because of security concerns. China developed the Hualong One as a rival to other reactor technologies competing for overseas orders, including the Westinghouse-developed AP1000 and France’s EPR technology.",

            "The initial contract funded expansion of BWXT’s Triso manufacturing capacity and upgrades to the existing systems in support of anticipated fuel needs for both the Department of Defense (DoD) and NASA. ",
            "The project is jointly funded by the DoD and NASA.  Under the terms of the amendment, BWXT’s Nuclear Operations Group will manufacture a quantity of natural uranium Triso particles and demonstrate those manufacturing operations on a production schedule.",
            "Triso refers to a specific design of uranium nuclear reactor fuel. Triso fuel can withstand extreme heat and has very low proliferation concerns and environmental risks, BWXT said. BWXT and the DOE have cooperated in the development and qualification of Triso-based fuel for more than 15 years.",
            "According to the DOE, Triso fuel testing is gaining interest from the advanced reactor community with some reactor vendors and the DoD planning to use Triso fuel for their designs, including small modular and microreactor concepts. NASA is interested in Triso fuel for powering space missions.",
            "Triso is short for “tristructural isotropic.” Triso particles are made up of uranium, carbon, and oxygen fuel kernels encapsulated by three layers of carbon- and ceramic-based materials to prevent the release of radioactive fission products. The particles are tiny – about the size of a poppy seed – and can be fabricated into cylindrical pellets or billiard ball–sized spheres called “pebbles” for use in high-temperature gas-cooled reactors or molten salt–cooled reactors."

            "Mr Gitzel pointed to “a perfect storm” of positive news for the nuclear and uranium sectors in 2021, including US president Joe Biden’s rejoining of the Paris climate agreement, which former president Donald Trump had walked away from in 2017. This was “a big deal”, Mr Gitzel said, because it ensured America’s commitment to decarbonisation and the reduction of fossil fuels.",
            "The Paris agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to keep average global temperatures from increasing to no more than 2 degrees Celsius – and preferably less than 1.5 degrees Celsius – by 2100, compared to pre-industrial times.",
            "On his first day in office Mr Biden also cancelled the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline, a move which Mr Gitzel said “did not go down well here in western Canada”, but showed where the Biden administration stood on fossil fuels.",
            "The pipeline was projected to carry oil nearly 1,900km from the Canadian province of Alberta down to Nebraska, to join an existing pipeline. Environmentalists and Native American groups had fought the project for more than a decade.",
            "Mr Gitzel said the virtual Earth Day Summit in April, led by Mr Biden and attended by world leaders, had further ratcheted down commitments to fossil fuel and agreed increasing climate commitments to get to net zero even sooner. In August, a UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report\r\nwhich concluded that climate changes are “a code red for humanity” had “rung through the world”, Mr Gitzel said. ",
            "Mr Gitzel said the world needs to decarbonise all electricity and then to double it, just to meet demand for “all the electric cars etc”. He said people don’t just want any electricity; they want clean, reliable, affordable electricity – and “the bottom line is that we are going to need all forms of energy, including nuclear”.",
            "Countries are realising this and the nuclear industry is “getting invited back to the parties we haven’t been to for 10 or 12 years”, he said.",
            "“There is a buzz that I haven’t seen for 10 years. There are 439 reactors in the world and 52 under construction. You look at a country like China with 54 reactors today and plans for 70 by 2025 and another 30 or 40 under construction after that. This is exciting growth.”",
            "The price of raw uranium, known as Yellowcake or U3O8, has risen to its highest levels since 2014, driven by competition for supplies between nuclear power operators and financial investors, who are betting on sharply higher prices and demand for the material used to fuel reactors.",
            "For Cameco, which sells uranium to more than 30 utilities around the world, this has led to growth in the demand side of its business. “Modestly, we see 2.6% growth over next number of years, not including advanced reactors or small modular reactors,” Mr Gitzel said.",
            "On the supply side, Mr Gitzel said the company has been on “a strict supply discipline programme”. In April 2016 it shut down its Rabbit Lake uranium mine in Canada and operations in Wyoming and Nebraska. In 2017 it shut the MacArthur River mine in Canada. The closures followed persistent market and price weakness resulting from oversupply since the March 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi accident, when reactors were shut down for safety checks. Many in Japan have not returned to service.",
            "The closures resulted in 18 million pounds of U3O8 a year removed from the market, but Cameco liquidated its inventory and “went out buying pounds on the market to put into our contracts”, Mr Gitzel said. “That’s been our strategy. The company remains very strong.”",
            "Cameco’s Cigar Lake uranium mine in Canada was closed for periods of 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid-19 pandemic, but is now “running well”. Mr Gitzel said the Inkai joint venture uranium mine in Kazakhstan has been “going through tricky period but seems to have come out and is running well”.",
            "I’m happy to say now, we’re back,” Mr Gitzel said. “There are some countries, Germany being one of them, that decided to phase out their nuclear post-Fukushima. So they’ve gone wind and solar, which hasn’t been particularly great for them.",
            "“In our business, people want electricity, period and they want clean electricity and so options are limited. We think nuclear is going to play a big role going forward.”"

            "New nuclear projects in Europe will not happen without “significant and comprehensive government support”, which could include a dedicated legal framework, an accommodating taxonomy, and state funding, the report says. ",
            "“We believe that most of European nuclear’s economic woes can be mitigated if government policies are sufficiently supportive or if at least they treat nuclear similarly to other low-carbon technologies in terms of access to the grid, tariff stability, and stable technical requirements regarding safety and security,” the report concludes.",
            "It also says new nuclear technologies, notably small modular reactors and hydrogen coupled to nuclear generation, can offer a new role for nuclear in Europe’s energy transition, if they prove technically viable, economic, and acceptable from the regulatory standpoint."

            "Mr Espinosa said nuclear, especially advanced small modular reactors would be a good source of generation because they fit the archipelagic nature of the Philippines.",
            "He said it will be SMRs – which generally have capacity of 300 MW or less – that can be best installed primarily in off-grid areas, given the archipelagic frame of the country’s energy market.",

The Akademik Lomonosov, the country’s first floating nuclear plant, is docked at Pevek and supplying energy for the remote Arctic port town. Moscow is also developing its icebreaker reactor technology for land-based SMRs for deployment to isolated mines and communities.",

            "Austria: Climate protection minister Leonore Gewessler said Austria will take the European commission to court if it moves ahead with its plans to include nuclear energy in the EU taxonomy rules on sustainable finance. “We will closely examine the current draft and have already ordered a legal opinion over nuclear energy in the taxonomy,” Ms Gewessler said on Twitter.",
            "Czech Republic: According to Daniel Beneš, chief executive officer of Czech state utility ČEZ, new units in Dukovany would be the last to be built in the country if the taxonomy proposal is approved with its current criteria, which state that to be deemed green, new plants must receive construction permits before 2045. “If the act is approved in this wording, it will bring major complications in terms of the transformation of Czech energy, particularly the heating sector,” Mr Beneš said. He said plans to modernise existing units at the Dukovany and Temelín nuclear stations would also breach the rules.",
            "Finland: The Finnish Energy Industry Association said the proposal to include nuclear power in the taxonomy is welcome. “Nuclear power will be necessary in the fight against climate change for a long time to come,” a statement said. “The proposal remains open to interpretation and needs clarification.” The association’s director, Jari Kostama, said: “The cCommission has taken a step in the right direction in presenting nuclear power as part of the taxonomy, but the step may not be sufficient at the moment. We still need to ensure that the proposal enables sustainable nuclear power production long into the future, as well as investments and technological development without unnecessary red tape.”",
            "France: President Emanuel Macron has not commented on the proposed taxonomy rules, but has already reversed a past decision to step back from nuclear power. In October, France announced “massive investments” in small modular reactors. SMRs are aklso attracting interest and support from previously neutral countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands. Mr Macron has also called for the construction of new-generation EPR2 reactors.",
            "Germany: The ruling coalition government said: “We consider nuclear technology to be dangerous. We consider the waste disposal problem to be still unresolved.”",
            "Poland: Andrzej Sadoś, the country’s representative to the EU, told the Polish Press Agency that the European commission taxonomy proposal is “extremely beneficial for Poland” because it takes into account the role of natural gas and nuclear energy in the EU. Poland wants to build from 6,000 to 9,000 MW of installed nuclear capacity with commercial operation of a first reactor unit in a proposed set of six earmarked for 2033.",
            "Slovakia: Prime minister Eduard Heger welcomed the “commission ‘s fulfilled promise to present in 2021 its proposal and include nuclear and natural gas into taxonomy – nuclear as sustainable and gas as transitional source,” he wrote on Twitter. “Slovakia has played a key role here with France and Czech Republic. We cannot reach climate neutrality without nuclear energy!” he added. Lubica Karvasova, a Slovak official, noted that labelling nuclear power as green is the outcome of the sustained political pressure from Slovakia.",
            "Spain: The government, led by a centre-left coalition of the Socialist Party (PSOE) and Unidas Podemos, objects to the new definition of green investment. “Natural gas and nuclear cannot be considered green or sustainable technologies in the taxonomy regulations, regardless of the possibility of making continued investments in both,” said a source at Spain’s Ministry for the Ecological Transition. This position was later confirmed by a ministry statement. “It makes no sense and it sends the wrong signals for the energy transition of the whole of the EU,” said minister Teresa Ribera in the statement."

",
            "The heat sector, which accounted for about 50% of final energy consumption globally in 2018 and about 40% of energy related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, is another area where advanced reactor systems can make a significant contribution to decarbonisation. Higher temperature heat of 550°C and upwards could be provided by many Generation IV concepts under development. A large percentage of the current global heat demand falls in this temperature range.

            "She said the EU is neutral towards the different energy technologies, but this means being attentive to the contribution that each of them – including nuclear – can bring towards achieving the bloc’s overarching goal, a decarbonised, fully integrated and more secure energy system by 2050.",
            "The EU foresees roughly a 15% share of nuclear across EU countries in 2050, down from about about 25% today, which is generated by 107 commercial reactors in 13 countries. ",
            "EU member states have committed to a reduction of at least 55% of emissions by 2030 and the EU aims to have at least 40% of renewables in its energy system by the same date. By 2030, 65% of electricity must be from renewables, which Ms Simson said were “the cheapest, the cleanest, domestically produced source of electricity”",
            "Another factor in renewed interest in nuclear is rapid technological innovation. Ms Simson said technological breakthroughs are bringing new solutions to old, and apparently intractable, problems, from waste disposal in deep underground storage to smaller scale installations that reduce the issues concerning location, long completion time and huge capital intensity of the classic nuclear installations. There is also a new momentum behind the research on nuclear fusion, with both public and private funded projects emerging.",
            "The nuclear industry has responded to the challenges of growth and competitiveness, Ms Simson said.",
            "According to industry reports covering the then 28 EU member states, in 2019 the nuclear sector directly employed over 350,000 people. Indirectly it supported over one million jobs, and over half a million of those were classed as highly-skilled.",
            "“We are talking about an impact of over €500bn on GDP,” she said. “And the estimates show that by 2050, the industry could grow to support more than 1.3 million jobs annually if the currently planned investment are realised. ",
            "“Europe is also leader in some technological segments, and could export these technologies abroad.”",
            "Taken together, growth, innovation, and the net zero goals are putting nuclear energy back to the centre of the discussion on the energy transition, Ms Simson said.",
            "Ms Simson called on the EU to “stand strongly” behind the development of innovation and research. “Small Modular Reactors are a great example,” she said. “Global interest in these technologies is on the rise. In Europe, industry is responding to this emerging demand with several EU designs already under development.”"

            "The IEA said France needs to strengthen the nuclear energy research most relevant to the energy transition, including the provision of flexible electricity by small modular reactors, cogeneration of electricity and heat, integration with hydrogen production, and materials’ testing under conditions of long-term operations.",
            "France’s 2015 energy transition legislation stipulated that the share of nuclear energy in the electricity supply shall be limited to 50% by 2025; a 2019 energy and climate law extended the target year to 2035, as the 2025 objective was unachievable given the pace of renewable energy development. ",
            "A 50% share of nuclear in electricity generation in 2035 would translate into a nuclear power capacity of around 52 GW reached by shutting down 14 reactors of 900 MW and commissioning the delayed Flamanville-3 EPR under construction in Normandy.",
            "According to the IEA report, there is “limited visibility” as to the future role of nuclear beyond 2035. The multiannual energy plan, with two five-year periods, confirms that no additional nuclear capacity is needed before 2035, but calls for the full assessment of a nuclear work programme by mid-2021. If France decides to maintain the share of 50% after 2035, long-term operation of existing plants and new builds are likely to be required.",
            "France is considering the construction of several new nuclear reactors and the French nuclear industry has stressed the importance of undertaking nuclear new build as part of a long-term programme that commits to several new constructions to allow for scale effects. ",
            "State power company and nuclear operator EDF has proposed to the government the construction of six EPR2 plants. The EPR2 builds on the original EPR design, of which two reactors are already generating electricity at Taishan in China and four more are under construction in France (Flamanville-3), inland (Olkiluoto-3) and the UK (Hinkley Point C1 and C2). ",
            "The IEA said that while the two Taishan reactors are operating well, the Flamanville and Olkiluoto projects have been hampered by delays and cost overruns.",
            "French media in October reported that the impact of Europe’s gas crisis on energy prices, and the knock-on effect on household spending power, had accelerated Paris’s decision to commit to the new EPR2 technology.",
            "President Emanuel Macron said recently that France will build new nuclear power reactors to help lessen its dependence on foreign countries for its energy supplies, meet global warming targets and keep prices under control.",
            "He had earlier said that by 2030 France must be a leader in carbon-free power production with one SMR in operation and nuclear plants used to produce clean hydrogen through electrolysis.",
            "In October 2021, France announced a €30bn investment plan for 2030, which targets French industrial development in the energy, automotive and space sectors, including €8bn dedicated to energy technology investment in hydrogen and SMRs.",
            "France has 56 commercial power reactors in commercial operation – second only to the US – at 18 sites with an installed capacity of 61.3 GW. Its share of nuclear in total electricity generation is about 67% – the highest of any country."

            "After losing an international arbitration case to Russia in 2016, Bulgaria had to pay €600m to Russian suppliers for the bulk of the nuclear equipment ordered for Belene. As a result, in 2018, the government led by then prime-minister Boiko Borisov formally revived the project.",

            "Why is hydrogen in the news?",
            "In simple terms, because initiatives have begun to transmit electricity produced by a nuclear plant – or another low-carbon energy facility such as solar – to electrolysers, which would produce what is known as “green hydrogen” for industry, transport and home heating, at the sites where the hydrogen is needed. The technology is reasonably mature, but remains expensive. Proponents say it can be commercialised for large-scale consumer use – possibly within years – to help bring about the transition to a zero-carbon hydrogen-based economy without the need for fossil fuels.",
            "Why is hydrogen special?",
            "Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and could become the perfect fuel. But this is not the only reason for the interest. When hydrogen is burned, no carbon dioxide is produced, instead, just water. In this way, its use would drastically reduce the emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect and global warming.",
            "The difficulty lies in the fact that in order to obtain hydrogen, electrical energy is needed, and if this energy comes from fossil fuels, emissions would be generated. In contrast, the production of green hydrogen is based on the use of low-carbon energy sources – including nuclear – to power the electrolysis process. The machine in charge of this process is called an electrolyser. ",
            "How would it work?",
            "Hydrogen is an environmentally friendly energy and flexible carrier that, unlike electricity, can be stored in large quantities. It can be converted into electricity in fuel cells, with only heat and water as by-products. It is compatible with combustion turbines and piston engines to produce power with near-zero emission of pollutants. All this, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, means hydrogen could play a major role in energy systems and serve all sectors of the economy, replacing fossil fuels and helping mitigate global warming.  Nuclear plants could be used to generate hydrogen for direct use by energy consumers. The US Department of Energy says this would allow utilities to produce and sell hydrogen regionally as a commodity in addition to providing clean and reliable electricity to the grid. For example, it could lead to reactors selling hydrogen to iron and steel manufacturing plants. Generating hydrogen using nuclear energy requires no fossil fuels, results in lower greenhouse-gas emissions and other pollutants and can lend itself to large-scale production. ",
            "How will hydrogen be produced from nuclear reactors?",
            "Reactors can viably produce clean, or green hydrogen by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. Methods are being explored to use nuclear energy to produce hydrogen from water by electrolysis, thermochemical, and hybrid processes. In simple terms, electrolysis involves chemical decomposition produced by passing an electric current through a liquid or solid electrolyte solution containing ions. Thermochemical relates to chemical reactions during which quantities of heat are evolved or absorbed. The industry’s focus is on developing hydrogen production technologies that are compatible with nuclear energy systems and do not produce greenhouse gases. Electrolysis using a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) seems the most likely solution. PEM electrolysis is the electrolysis of water in a cell equipped with a solid polymer electrolyte, which separates the produced hydrogen and oxygen gases.",
            "What is an electrolyser and why is it key to green hydrogen supply?",
            "The electrolyser is an apparatus that produces hydrogen through a chemical process (electrolysis). It uses electricity to separate the hydrogen and oxygen elements of which the water molecule is composed. Hydrogen produced in this sustainable way – without emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – produces green hydrogen and can be the basis for a decarbonised economy. Tests on the technology are likely to be carried out at nuclear plants with electrolysers of about 1 MW. Exelon Generation has placed an order for a 1.25 MW PEM electrolyser to be installed at Nine Mile Point nuclear station as part of what it called a ground-breaking project for green hydrogen production. The largest PEM unit operating is a 20-MW electrolyser at Air Liquide’s site in Canada. It is used for producing hydrogen from water electrolysis using electricity generated by renewable technologies. It can produce over 8.2 tonnes of low-carbon hydrogen per day – enough to fuel over 2,000 cars, 275 buses, or 230 large trucks.",
            "Why is it called “green hydrogen”?",
            "Hydrogen production is classified using a colour scheme. “Grey hydrogen” denotes hydrogen produced from fossil fuels. Most of the world’s hydrogen production is grey. However, it is possible to capture the carbon dioxide produced in this process. The carbon can then be sequestered or otherwise used for other purposes. This lowers the carbon footprint and can result in the subsequent hydrogen being classified as “blue hydrogen”. Blue hydrogen is produced using non-renewable resources, but it meets the threshold of a low-carbon footprint. Green hydrogen, such as that produced by nuclear reactors, is considered low-carbon. It can be produced using other technologies. For example, electricity from solar power can be used to electrolyse water into its constituents, hydrogen and oxygen. A 2020 paper in ‘Applied Energy’ estimated the carbon footprint of hydrogen production via a number of different methods, and concluded that hydrogen production via nuclear electricity has a comparable carbon footprint to hydrogen produced by renewables.",
            "Nuclear Hydrogen: Facts And Figures",
            "According to the International Energy Agency, annual global dedicated hydrogen production stands at around 70 million tonnes. The US Department of Energy says a single 1,000-MW nuclear reactor could produce more than 200,000 tonnes of hydrogen each year. Ten nuclear reactors could produce about two million tonnes annually or one-fifth of the current hydrogen used in the US. This process would allow utilities to produce and sell hydrogen regionally as a commodity in addition to providing clean and reliable electricity to the grid. The DOE says it could lead to reactors in Ohio selling hydrogen to iron and steel manufacturing plants. The Midwest could target fertiliser producers and California could market hydrogen stations for fuel cell electric vehicles. In the UK, the Climate Change Committee estimates a future hydrogen production need of between 160 and 380 TWh per year – over 10 times current production of 10 to 27 TWh per year derived from mostly fossil sources. The International Energy Agency said recently there are encouraging signs that low-carbon hydrogen production is on the cusp of significant cost declines and widespread global growth. But it called for governments to move faster and more decisively on policy measures to enable hydrogen to fulfil its potential to help the world reach net zero emissions while supporting energy security.",
            "What are the obstacles?",
            "British environmentalist Jonathan Porritt said for hydrogen to become a mainstream energy source, there will need to be a complete revolution in the way in which it is produced. As it is, 98% of the hydrogen used globally is “grey hydrogen”, made from natural gas or coal, that emits around 830 million tonnes of CO2 per annum – 2% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. Beyond that, there’s a tiny amount of so-called “blue hydrogen” – essentially grey hydrogen but with its CO2 emissions captured and stored – and an even tinier amount of green hydrogen from electrolysing water, both of which are much more expensive than grey hydrogen.",
            "So hydrogen production is expensive?",
            "Renewable production of hydrogen could lead us towards a hydrogen economy, but there are obstacles that have kept this vision from being realised. The biggest issue with green hydrogen is the cost. The US says hydrogen produced using clean power sources, including renewables and nuclear energy, currently costs about $5/kg. It wants to reduce this to $1/kg. The UK-based New Nuclear Watch Institute argues that using nuclear power to produce hydrogen using electrolyser technology has several advantages compared to using intermittent renewables – and one of those advantages is cost. It said hydrogen produced from nuclear plants would cost $5.63/kg. This compares to $9.81/kg to $12.46/kg for new, dedicated wind and $27.12/kg for balancing wind.",
            "What’s next? ",
            "According to the International Energy Agency, around 12 demonstration hydrogen projects with a combined electrolyser capacity of 250 MW are exploring using nuclear power for hydrogen production. These projects are in Canada, China, Russia, the UK and the US, but the IEA said that not all will be realised.",
            "In the US, Exelon Corporation, the country’s largest nuclear plant operator, is planning to install a 1-MW electrolyser at one of its boiling water reactor plant sites to demonstrate hydrogen production. In May 2021, the US DOE said its Idaho National Laboratory will collaborate with California-based Bloom Energy on a project to produce clean hydrogen using electrolysis technology powered by nuclear energy. INL is also working with Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy to demonstrate a hydrogen system that could “transform the nuclear energy industry”. The hydrogen will initially be used at the nuclear power plant where it is produced, but it could eventually be sold to other industries. ",
            "In Europe, Brussels-based industry association Foratom said recently the low-carbon production of hydrogen from commercial nuclear power plants could help Europe reach its climate goals, but the EU needs to put in place the right policy incentives to expand development of the emerging technology. ",
            "In July 2020, 15 companies and trade unions, including France’s state-controlled power company EDF and several engineering firms, announced proposals for a clean energy hub at Moorside in the UK including up to three EPR reactors, small modular reactors, advanced modular reactors and hydrogen production. The hub would be linked with maritime facilities such as freeports and could provide heat, chilled water and power. The UK says existing large-scale reactors could produce green hydrogen at scale through electrolysis, as could the next generation of gigawatt-scale reactors. SMRs, the first unit of which could be deployed within the next 10 years, would unlock further possibilities for green hydrogen production near industrial clusters. Advanced modular reactors under development offer one of the most promising innovations for green hydrogen production, since they will create temperatures high enough to split water without diverting electricity."

            "Rolls-Royce has promised to “harness decades of British engineering, design and manufacturing knowhow” to roll out the first of its SMRs, which are based on a similar technology used to propel nuclear submarines.",
            "Each of the initial run of reactors is expected to have a generation capacity of 470 MW, or enough to power the equivalent of 1.3m UK homes, and cost about £2.2bn per unit dropping to £1.8bn by the time five have been completed. This means it will be comparable with offshore wind at around £50/MWh. A single SMR power station will occupy the footprint of two football pitches.",
            "Rolls-Royce said the potential for this to be a leading global export for the UK is unprecedented. Nine-tenths of an individual Rolls-Royce SMR power plant will be built or assembled in factory conditions and around 80% could be delivered by a UK supply chain.",
            "Much of the venture’s investment is expected to be focused in the north of the UK, where there is significant existing nuclear expertise.",

            "Mr Macron said in a televised address to the nation that he will revive the French nuclear programme with the construction of new EPR2 nuclear reactors in the coming years. ",
            "“We will for the first time in decades restart the construction of nuclear reactors in our country and continue to develop renewable energy,” he said. Mr Macron said nuclear will help the country lessen its dependence on foreign countries for its energy supplies, meet global warming targets and keep prices under control.",
            "The announcement follows a report by French grid operator RTE which said next generation nuclear reactors offer an affordable path to shifting the country’s energy mix away from fossil fuels and make the aim of carbon neutrality by 2050 achievable.",
            "Previously, the government had said it would not launch any new EPR reactor projects until state-owned EDF’s delayed Flamanville-3 EPR is completed.",
            "But French media in October reported that the impact of Europe’s gas crisis on energy prices, and the knock-on effect on household spending power, had accelerated Paris’s decision to commit to the new EPR technology.",
            "France has 56 commercial nuclear power reactors that provide about 70% of its electricity, the highest share of any country.",
            "Last month Mr Macron said that by 2030 France must be a leader in carbon-free power production with one small modular reactor in operation and nuclear plants used to produce clean hydrogen through electrolysis.",
            "He said Europe will never have enough renewable energy capacity to produce sufficient green hydrogen and that France’s nuclear plants are a major asset for doing this.",
            "The chairman of state utility and nuclear operator EDF, Jean-Bernard Lévy, said in an interview for Politico that the deployment of six new EPR units between 2035 and 2045 would help France meet its climate neutrality targets while supporting the accelerated development of renewables.",
            "According to Gifen, the nuclear industry is France’s third largest industrial sector, with 3,200 companies and 220,000 employees, and “is now ready to respond to the presidential commitment”. ",
            "“The French nuclear industry is now ready to build these EPR2 reactors, which will create many qualified jobs, multiply innovations and once again have this French industrial know-how recognised around the world, Ms Arbouille said."

            "EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said the pact gave room for hope. “It shows … that the US and China know this subject transcends other issues. And it certainly helps us here at Cop26 to come to an agreement,” Mr Timmermans said.",
            "UN secretary general Antonio Guterres called the move “an important step in the right direction”. On social media he welcomed the agreement and noted that the crisis requires international collaboration and solidarity.",
            "The agreement between the US and China refers to the recently released Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which described the urgent need to tackle the climate emergency in alarming detail. The agreement states that both countries recognise the seriousness of the crisis, whilst accepting the significant gaps that remain, between efforts currently being made to tackle it, and the steps that are needed to achieve the goals of the Paris climate agreement, reached at Cop21 in 2015.",
            "In Paris, leaders pledged to try to keep the world from warming by more than between 1.5C to 2°C through sweeping emissions cuts.",
            "The latest IPCC report said many of the changes being seen in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and warned that findings in the report are “a code red for humanity”.",
            "It said that within the next two decades, temperatures are likely to rise by more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, breaching the ambition of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and bringing widespread devastation and extreme weather.US climate envoy John Kerry told a press conference: “The two largest economies in the world have agreed to work together on emissions in this decisive decade.",
            "“This is a roadmap for our countries and future collaboration. China and the US have no shortage of differences. But cooperation is the only way to get this job done. This is about science, about physics.”",
            "He said: “This declaration is a step that we can build on to close the gap [between the emissions cuts set out so far and those needed]. Every step matters. We have a long journey ahead of us.”",
            "China’s climate envoy Xie Zhenhua told a separate news conference: “There is more agreement between the US and China than divergence, making it an area of huge potential for cooperation.",
            "“By working together our two countries can achieve many important things that are beneficial not only to our two countries but the world as a whole.”",
            "Earlier this week, a draft of a general Cop26 agreement was released, urging countries to strengthen their 2030 greenhouse gas emissions targets by the end of next year in a recognition of the gap between current pledges and the Paris agreement.",
            "The text, released by the Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, called on all countries to increase their short-term commitments in 2022, which would be a step forward. It also asks them to agree to an annual high-level ministerial round table focused on raising ambition further starting next November.",
            "The document is not final and Cop26 delegates from nearly 200 countries will now negotiate the details over the next few days. Consensus from all nations is required.",
            "Construction of a new nuclear power station at Zhejiang in China.",
            "US And China: The Nuclear Option For Net Zero",
            "Both the US and China are looking at new nuclear reactors as one element of their climate policies and the challenge of reaching net zero.",
            " US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm told Yahoo News at Cop26 that the Biden administration is “very bullish” on building new nuclear reactors in the US.",
            "“Half of the United States’ clean power now – when I say ‘clean’ I’m talking about net-zero carbon emissions – is through the nuclear fleet,” she said. “If you look at the overall power, it’s about 20%. Globally, 29% of the clean power is nuclear.”",
            "President Joe Biden’s $1.2tn infrastructure legislation lays out plans for the development of new nuclear reactor technology and a credit programme for existing reactors that face closure because of economic reasons.",
            "The legislation says Ms Granholm will submit a report describing how the Department of Energy could improve energy resilience and reduce carbon emissions with the use of small modular reactors and microreactors.",
            "The US nuclear fleet has been facing revenue shortfalls because of declining energy prices and market rules that the nuclear industry says favour fossil fuel plants. A key element of the Biden legislation for the nuclear industry is its call for a credit programme for commercial nuclear reactors. It calls on Ms Granholm to evaluate nuclear reactors that are projected to be permanently shut down because of economic factors and to allocate credits to those that qualify.",
            "A recent International Energy Agency report said nuclear power could expand rapidly if China meets its Paris agreement goals on carbon neutrality, almost quintupling between 2020 and 2060 and potentially becoming the largest commercial reactor fleet in the world after 2030.",
            "Nuclear energy’s share of primary demand could reach around 15% in 2060 compared with 3% today. Output could also increase substantially with the share of nuclear in the generation mix jumping from 5% in 2020 to 10% in 2060 – equal to adding four 1 GW reactors every year on average. Construction is focused on coastal regions with China’s fleet of nuclear reactors surpassing the 93 plants in the US to become the largest in the world after 2030.",
            "Nuclear power has increased markedly in China, with 48 reactors commissioned between 2000 and 2020, taking the total to 52 in commercial operation and boosting the share of nuclear in primary energy demand from 0.4% to 2.7% and the share of power generation from 1.2% to over 5%.",
            "The country’s 14th Five-Year Plan for 2021-2026 marks a shift in emphasis by highlighting the importance of “extensively expanding” solar and wind. It further sets a target of 70 GW of installed nuclear capacity, up from 52 GW as of mid-2021, and a non-fossil fuel share of primary energy use of 20% by 2025, up from just under 16% in 2020."

The NuScale six-module power plant is estimated to generate 193 permanent power plant jobs, 1,500 construction jobs, 2,300 manufacturing jobs and help Romania avoid four million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year, NuScale said.",

The scalable design – power plants can house up to 12 individual power modules – offers the benefits of carbon-free energy and reduces the financial commitments associated with gigawatt-sized nuclear facilities, NuScale said.

            "Mr Hands told the House of Commons: “Nuclear is part of a low-cost future electricity system. Nuclear helps to reduce our exposure to volatile global gas prices. The measures in this Bill mean we can keep nuclear in the mix at a lower cost than would otherwise be the case.”",
            "Under the legislation, which has yet to be approved, the government will be able to designate a company to benefit from a RAB model, provided that it satisfies certain criteria. Conditions could be inserted into the company’s electricity generation licence to allow it to receive a regulated revenue in respect of the design, construction, commissioning and operation of a nuclear project. ",
            "A RAB model allows a company to charge consumers to construct and operate new infrastructure projects. It allows a company’s investors to share some of the project’s construction and operating risks with consumers, overseen by “a strong economic regulator”. That in turn significantly lowers the cost of capital, which is the main driver of a nuclear project’s cost to consumers, Mr Hands said.",
            "Parliament was told that RAB is a tried and tested method that has successfully financed other large UK infrastructure projects. The introduction of a special administration regime will prioritise a plant’s opening and continued operation in the unlikely event of a project company’s insolvency. That will protect consumers’ investment in the plant and ensure that they realise the plant’s benefit. The legislation is not specific to one project and could be applied to nuclear projects across Britain.",
            "Mr Hands said the RAB model could open up opportunities for British companies and the country’s closest partners to develop new projects and technologies, including the Wylfa Newydd site in Anglesey and small modular reactors.",
            "The legislation could help to get new projects off the ground throughout Britain, including, potentially, the Sizewell C project to build two EPRs, which is the subject of ongoing negotiations between France’s state-owned energy company EDF and the government.",
            "“The most important thing to understand about this Bill is that it enables future nuclear projects and a diversity of financing models, with greater access to private sector finance in particular, so that we are less dependent on overseas developers as we go forward,” Mr Hands said. “That is the most important thing to take away.”",
            "The RAB model will require consumers to pay a small amount on their bills during the construction of a nuclear project. These payments from the start of construction will avoid the build-up of interest on loans that would otherwise lead to higher costs to consumers in the future.",
            "A project starting construction in 2023 will add only a very small amount to the average dual-fuel household bill during this parliament, and, on average, less than £1 per month during the full construction phase of the project.",
            "Conservative MP John Redwood said “the new nuclear the minister is talking about will not even replace the nuclear that is closing”, but Mr Hands told him the RAB model can be used for further nuclear power plants, including SMRs and other key nuclear innovations. He noted that in the net zero review, the government launched a £120m fund for new nuclear innovations, which will allow it to increase its nuclear commitments and capabilities beyond the existing commitment to one new plant being approved in the coming years.",
            "Another Conservative MP, Neil Parish, said Hinkley Point C will produce between 7% and 8% of the nation’s electricity needs once both reactors are up and running. A further plant of the same size would perhaps take it to 16%, but “we need at least 25% to 30% if we are to make sure we have enough power to keep the grid going when the wind stops and there is no sunlight”.",
            "Mr Hands said it is clear that the UK needs a new funding model to support the financing of large-scale and advanced nuclear technologies. Under the existing mechanism to support new nuclear projects, the contracts for difference scheme, developers have to finance the construction of a nuclear project and only begin receiving revenue when the station starts generating electricity. “That was the right model to use for Hinkley Point C, given that it was the first nuclear project to be built in the UK for a generation,” Mr Hands said.",
            "But the lack of alternative funding models has led to the cancellation of recent potential projects, such as Hitachi’s project at Wylfa Newydd in Wales and Toshiba’s at Moorside in Cumbria, Mr Hands said. “We have digested the lessons from Hinkley Point C; it is time to provide these alternatives.”",
            "Labour MP Alan Whitehead told the debate that the main opposition Labour Party believes that new nuclear has an important supporting role to play in the energy mix, alongside the decisive shift to renewables that we need to deliver the climate transition and secure our energy security. “As set out by the climate change committee, we need all the low-carbon power sources at our disposal to deliver the rapid and fair transition that is required,” he said.",
            "Mr Hands said “we need something that can be deployed at scale to provide the bulk of our electricity when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing”. ",
            "“We are always open-minded on other new technologies, but the most important thing is what can be deployed at scale. The measures in this Bill are critical for ensuring we have the option to bring forward further nuclear capacity.”",
            "Twelve of the UK’s 13 current nuclear reactors, representing approximately 85% of nuclear capacity, are scheduled to close by 2030. Although Hinkley Point C is under construction, additional nuclear is likely to be needed in a low-cost 2050 electricity system, Mr Hands said.",
            "The government recently announced funding of £1.7bn\r\nin the Sizewell C nuclear power station project as it pushes to reach a final investment decision within three years and begin a programme of new-build that will replace the nation’s aging reactors.",
            "Three projects – Wylfa, Moorside and Oldbury – have either been cancelled or shelved, largely because of financing problems, while Bradwell remains in the early technical stages."

Most importantly these mines have demands in the vicinity of the 5-20 MWe range. Most mines have lifespans of between 10 and 35 years, and about 15 new off-grid mines are built per year, representing potential new mining markets for SMRs.",
            "Where eVinci microreactors replace diesel power at a mine site, carbon emissions would be reduced by 90%, the study says.",
            "A reactor facility such as the eVinci microreactor could provide a steady supply of non-emitting energy 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. This provides spin-off opportunities for communities to better their conditions based on energy availability, the study says.",
            "The international market for microreactors has been estimated in the SMR roadmap to be between CAD30bn (€20bn) and CAD35bn per year from 2030-40. While the demand for energy in these locations is much smaller than for on-grid electricity generation, these communities and mines also use large amounts of diesel fuel, making microreactors a viable option.",
            "The study says engaging with communities, private industry and indigenous rights holders will be critical to securing support for microreactor deployments. Engagement with the nuclear regulator will also be critical to develop an approach to licensing the eVinci. “It is important to address the full range of considerations associated with licensing a microreactor,” the study says.",
            "In 2020, Bruce Power, which operates eight nuclear plants at the Bruce station in Ontario, and Westinghouse Electric Company agreed to explore applications of the eVinci within Canada. The eVinci microreactor is a next-generation microreactor, essentially a small battery for decentralised generation markets and for micro grids. It is self-contained, autonomously controlled and remotely monitored."

            "Mr Lévy said EDF wants to involve the European nuclear supply chain in its Nuward SMR project, being jointly developed with France’s CEA, Naval Group, and TechnicAtome since 2019.",
            "Mr Lévy also called on policymakers to help the development of zero-carbon technologies by allowing support mechanisms which give long-term signals needed to reduce capital costs and trigger investment decisions.",
            "In response to a question about the potential revamp of the EU’s competition and state support rules, he said: “Achieving climate neutrality is the compass that must guide our industrial and economic choices. The competition objective is a means to an end.”",

            "It did not mention the possibility of new reactors, despite calls for new-build from some industry officials and a number of lawmakers. Japan is pursuing research and development of small modular reactors, considered a clean, affordable and safer nuclear power option in the future.",
            "The 128-page plan, compiled by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, says Japan should set ambitious targets for hydrogen and ammonia energy, carbon recycling and nuclear energy. It also calls for promoting offshore wind power and use of rechargeable batteries that have potential for growth.",
            "“We will mobilise all options” to achieve the emissions target, the plan said, adding that the “supply of stable and low-cost energy is a prerequisite.”",
            "The changes in the plan are meant to achieve the carbon emissions reduction target announced in April by former prime minister Yoshihide Suga. His successor, Fumio Kishida, who has backed nuclear plant restarts and SMRs, took office this month. There is no mention of SMRs in the new energy policy.",
            "Japan has pledged to reduce its emissions by 46% from 2013 levels, up from an earlier target of 26%, to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Japan says it would try to push the reduction as high as 50% to be in line with the European Union’s commitment. ",
            "The energy plan says renewables should account for 36-38% of the power supply in 2030, up from the current target of 22-24%, and that newly introduced fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia should comprise 1%.",
            "The target for fossil fuel use was slashed to 41% in 2030 from 56%. The plan said Japan will reduce dependence on fossil fuel without setting a timeline. ",
            "The plan keeps the target for nuclear power unchanged at 20-22%. Japan says it aims to reduce its reliance on nuclear power as much as possible but that nuclear will remain an important energy source. ",
            "Economy and industry minister Koichi Hagiuda has said “drastic energy conservation, maximum promotion of renewables and safe restarts of nuclear reactors” are key.",

            "The IEA said the nuclear generation fleet in the G7 – which consists of the US, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan – has prevented at least 50 Gt of CO2 over the past 50 years, equivalent to over 1.5 years of global energy-related emissions. G7 countries have 220 commercial nuclear reactors in operation between them. Italy has shut down its nuclear plants, Germany has decided to phase out nuclear and many of Japan’s 33 reactors remain offline following the 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi accident.",
            "Small modular reactors, if successfully commercialised, could overcome some of the barriers that hinder large-scale nuclear deployment. Their advantages include scalable designs, lower upfront costs and the potential to improve the flexibility of nuclear power in terms of both operations and outputs such as electricity, heat or hydrogen. ",
            "Successfully commercialising new nuclear technologies could offer new economic opportunities and lead to cost reductions and standardisation processes that could benefit other countries.",
            "The report noted that G7 members spent $8.4bn of public research and development money in 2019 on electricity generation, transmission and distribution and on electrical storage technologies, with more than 55% of this funding linked to nuclear power technologies and 28% was for renewable energy technologies.",
            "While still dominant today, spending on nuclear technologies has declined in absolute and relative terms since 2005, when it accounted for more than 80% of electricity sector-related RD&D spending, before increasing again in recent years, driven in particular by the UK and the US.",
            "The report concluded that scaling up low-carbon technologies – including nuclear – is the central pillar to achieve net zero, with wind and solar PV capacity additions scaling up from about 75 GW in 2020 to 230 GW by 2030. Nuclear power, low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia, and plants equipped with carbon capture add further to the low-emissions electricity supply."

The IMSR400 is one of two Generation IV technology candidates and the only Canadian technology candidate.",
            "The IMSR plant is a proprietary design drawing on Generation IV reactor technology developed and demonstrated over many decades. Using molten salt reactor technology, the IMSR400 generates electric power 50% more efficiently than conventional nuclear power plants that use water-cooled and water-moderated reactor technology. ",
            "According to Terrestrial Energy, with this 50% efficiency improvement, the IMSR has a reduced capital requirement and waste footprint, and improved economics per kWh of electricity for new nuclear power plants.",
            "The IMSR uses nuclear fuel at standard enrichment – the only Generation IV SMR power plant designed to do this today. This avoids the considerable cost and time of re-licensing uranium enrichment plants and removes hurdles to commercialisation, Terrestrial Energy said.",

            "The International Energy Agency said recently there are encouraging signs that low-carbon hydrogen production is on the cusp of significant cost declines and widespread global growth. But it called for governments to move faster and more decisively on policy measures to enable hydrogen to fulfil its potential to help the world reach net zero emissions while supporting energy security.",
            "According to the IEA, around 12 demonstration hydrogen projects with a combined electrolyser capacity of 250 MW are exploring using nuclear power for hydrogen production. These projects are in Canada, China, Russia, the UK and the US, but the IEA said that not all will be realised.",

",
            "What Is Green Hydrogen?",
            "Hydrogen production is classified using a colour scheme. “Grey hydrogen” denotes hydrogen produced from fossil fuels. Most of the world’s hydrogen production is grey. However, it is possible to capture the carbon dioxide produced in this process. The carbon can then be sequestered or otherwise used for other purposes. This lowers the carbon footprint and can result in the subsequent hydrogen being classified as “blue hydrogen”. Blue hydrogen is produced using non-renewable resources, but it meets the threshold of a low-carbon footprint. Green hydrogen, such as that produced by nuclear reactors, is considered low-carbon. It can be produced using other technologies. For example, electricity from solar power can be used to electrolyse water into its constituents, hydrogen and oxygen. A 2020 paper in ‘Applied Energy’ estimated the carbon footprint of hydrogen production via a number of different methods, and concluded that hydrogen production via nuclear electricity has a comparable carbon footprint to hydrogen produced by renewables."

            "NucNet: The Nuclear Industry Association has been warning policymakers about the risks of energy supply based largely on renewables and natural gas. Power prices in Europe have increased to unsustainably high levels in recent months, sparking an energy crisis in many countries, especially the UK. Perhaps you can tell us why this has happened? ",
            "Tom Greatrex: What we have been warning of for a very long time has happened in the UK and it will continue to affect us, at least for this winter and quite possibly well beyond. Over the last few months, we’ve had relatively low output from wind power. The UK has got quite a lot of wind-powered installed capacity, but its variability has really shown itself over the past few months.",
            "At the same time, a power interconnector between the UK and France caught fire and reduced the electricity imports coming from France.",
            "We have also had the impact of higher demand, or lower output, or a combination of both, for gas in Europe and this has caused prices to go up. And we haven’t yet managed to significantly break the link between traded gas prices and electricity prices in the UK, because we are overly reliant on burning fossil fuels imported into the UK for our electricity, particularly at times when the weather isn’t optimum for the delivery of wind or solar.",
            "Add to this the fact that our nuclear fleet in the UK is in the process of retiring. In June, EDF Energy said it would begin defuelling two rectors at Dungeness B seven years ahead of schedule. In 2022, two units at Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B are scheduled to close, although Hunterston B could actually burn its last fuel before the end of this year. This means our clean, firm power capacity is also reducing at the same time to what is a real unholy mess. It’s no comfort that the current crisis was predictable, but it’s where we are.",
            "NucNet: What place does nuclear generation have in this uncertain market? Large nuclear operating countries like France are being affected by high energy prices too. Critics might say nuclear is not helping?",
            "TG: My answer to those critics is that simply we haven’t got enough nuclear. It’s pretty obvious, frankly, that we’ve got a fleet which is ageing and retiring and therefore our clean baseload capacity is going down. That means we are more vulnerable and exposed to the vagaries of both the weather and internationally traded commodities and both of them together, which is what we’re experiencing.",
            "If we did what we should have done 10 years ago and actually got on with building nuclear plants, we could well have been in a different position by now. We could have had more nuclear either delivering or about to come online to help mitigate that impact of those factors which are not within the control of any government. One can’t control the weather and no government can have a really significant impact on international trading commodities.",
            "So if energy security is as important as politicians in the UK often say it is, I think there’s been a bit of a wakeup call. It’s too late in the sense of being able to make a difference for the immediate issue, but we could be in a much better place if such a crisis comes around again.",
            "NucNet: So what you’re calling on the government to do is to accelerate a nuclear new-build programme. But is this message really reaching policymakers? ",
            "TG: I think there has been a noticeable shift in the UK in terms of government and policymakers over the last few weeks. I think the implications of security of supply on the events that have come to pass have really made ripples. I think there probably might have been a hopeful thought that the UK will get through, find some way of dealing with this energy crisis.",
            "But, I think that assessment has been fundamentally changed. And this at the same time as we’ve got COP26 happening in the UK, and the government’s pressing a net zero commitment by 2050. This is all in the context of energy security that I think minds have been focused on a bit. ",
            "So I think we are noticing a discernible position of the UK government almost, but not quite, acknowledging that perhaps it’s gone a bit slow on nuclear and the determination to try to move a bit quicker – and that’s very welcome.",
            "NucNet: The government seems to be on the verge of committing public money in nuclear new build. It has also been working on a new regulated asset base (RAB) model to help finance large infrastructure projects, including nuclear. Is this likely to help? Is the legislation in the process of being finalised? ",
            "TG: Well, the RAB idea has been circulating for quite a while, but it will relatively soon be put into legislation to help finance large capital intensive projects. The RAB model is not entirely new and has been in use in other sectors.",
            "What is at play here is that there seems to have been an understanding and an acceptance that trying to build new nuclear – be that large, conventional reactors or small modular reactors – using the contracts for difference model that we used for Hinkley Point C is just not going to work because the cost of capital is too high.                ",
            "I think the government is ready to move forward with a different approach, which will significantly reduce the cost of capital and help accelerate some of the projects that have been talked about for the last few years without very much happening.",
            "NucNet: And the NIA welcomes the RAB move? ",
            "TG: Yes, more than that. We’ve been lobbying for it for a while and said very clearly that without it, there won’t be any new build. It’s no good for ministers and people to say: ‘Oh yes, we want some more nuclear’ and they don’t fundamentally fix that policy framework issue. It’s fundamental to being able to get more capacity built.",
            "NucNet: Do you think the large energy-intensive industries will increase their interest in nuclear?",
            "TG: By and large, the energy-intensive industries in the UK have always been on board with nuclear because they use and need a lot of power. Their primary motivation has been predictability of electricity cost. And they want the reliability in terms of price, predictability over medium to long periods rather than massive fluctuations and variations in supply and price.",
            "They’ve always been in that position. Chemical industries in the UK, for example, have always been part of the voices calling for more nuclear. The main business body, the CBI in the UK, which covers all sorts of industries, is pro and has been for a long time pro-nuclear both in respect to climate and security of supply.",
            "I think what has changed is with these energy price hikes happening every now and again, security of supplier has gone higher up the list at the moment in the UK with some people who might be not necessarily in industry, but are around the debate and may have been less likely to speak when they felt the debate was solely focused on climate.",
            "NucNet: And what about the media? Do you see an increased interest in nuclear and an effort to understand it?",
            "TG: Yes, there is a bit of a surge there as well. It has partly been as a result of what’s been happening. We’ve commentary from different places, media commentators and leading writers in the main newspapers saying not only that we need new nuclear, but we need to be actively working on it – that the government needs to be active in helping to facilitate that delivery. ",
            "NucNet: How much new nuclear does the UK need to meet its clean energy needs?",
            "TG: Well, the first thing is that we can’t extend the lifetime of our fleet any longer, with the exception of the single-unit Sizewell B, which is the only nuclear plant that will operate beyond 2030. At the moment, it is scheduled to stop operating in 2035 and in all likelihood might be able to be extended into the 2050s. But everything else has been through lifetime extensions already. Operators are not going to be able to squeeze any more out of them. So we don’t really have the option of long-term operation.",
            "To get to net zero and a decarbonised power supply, in the UK we need four times the amount of clean power that we currently have. By the mid-2030s, we need at least 10 GW of new nuclear, and at least another 20 GW nuclear to meet net zero in 2050. And we see a fleet of small modular reactors that would complement large reactor generation. And all of this happening in parallel.",
            "NucNet: What about broader energy issues beyond electricity generation? I’m thinking of issues such as district heating and the generation of green hydrogen from nuclear.",
            "TG: Indeed, almost everything we have talked about to this point was about grid power. I think it’s a really important contextual point that this isn’t just about grid electricity. This is about energy more widely and the role that nuclear can play in that, and will play in that if we’re going to successfully decarbonise more widely. This is another reason why I think we need a lot more electricity capacity.",
            "The broader decarbonisation challenge includes heating. We will need to either directly electrify it or use an energy source which is best generated through using clean electricity to drive it, like hydrogen, for example. ",
            "In the context of current price and supply issues, I think policymakers are perhaps starting to understand a bit better than they would have done a few months ago what the role of hydrogen could be. How are we going to best produce that hydrogen without reinforcing the same problems about being over-reliant on gas and gas prices?"

            "He said it is important to note that it is not just governments that are driving this trend, but also businesses, as companies are similarly making net zero pledges as part of their environmental-social-governance commitments.",
            "Mr Hryhoriw pointed to forecasts that uranium demand could climb 27% from 162 million pounds of U3O8 in 2021 to 206 million lbs by 2030 and 292 million lbs – an increase of 80% – by 2040.  Current primary supply is expected to decline 30% by 2035 and 54% by 2040 due to resource depletion, with future supply projected to be well below demand due to a lack of investment in new mines.",
            "He said utilities have not been replenishing the uranium they are consuming under long-term contracts and therefore have growing uncovered requirements to fill.  This is occurring at a time when there are some big question marks about where the uranium will come from in the future to fuel the world’s expanding nuclear fleet.  ",
            "“In fact, given the persistently low prices, we have seen both planned supply curtailments and a lack of investment in new production capacity, exacerbated by the end of reserve life for some mines, shrinking secondary supplies and trade policy issues,” Mr Hryhoriw said. All of this has been amplified by unplanned supply disruptions – due largely to the pandemic – and the increased demand for uranium from financial funds and junior uranium companies. ",
            "The price of raw uranium, known as Yellowcake, has risen to its highest level since 2014, driven by competition for supplies between nuclear power operators and financial investors, who are betting on sharply higher prices and demand for the material used to fuel reactors.",
            "Investors believe commercial nuclear power will be a key part of the move away from fossil fuels and that a lack of new uranium mines will mean the price has to move higher. The World Nuclear Association said world uranium production dropped considerably from 63,207 tonnes of uranium (tU) in 2016 to 47,731 tU in 2020 and “intense development” of new projects will be needed by the end of the decade to avoid potential supply disruptions.",
            "A newly launched investment trust run by Canadian asset manager Sprott Physical Uranium Trust has snapped up around six million pounds of physical uranium, worth around $240m, since launching on 19 July, helping to push uranium prices to over $50 per pound, up from $30 at the start of the year. ",
            "Earlier this month, Cameco signed a memorandum of understanding with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH), GEH SMR Technologies Canada and Synthos Green Energy to evaluate the potential establishment of a uranium fuel supply chain in Canada capable of servicing a potential fleet of BWRX-300 small modular reactors in Poland.",
            "In July, the company signed an MOU with GEH and Global Nuclear Fuel-Americas to explore several areas of cooperation to advance the commercialisation and deployment of BWRX-300 small modular reactors in Canada and around the world.",
            "Cameco said this MOU is non-binding and non-exclusive and it might develop similar arrangements with other SMR vendors. “We intend to be a go-to fuel supplier across the SMR domain, just as we continue to be for conventional large-scale reactors,” Mr Hryhoriw said.",
            "Since 2016, Cameco has suspended production at a number of its uranium mines and mills in Canada and the US due to persistent market and price weakness resulting from oversupply that has existed since the March 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi accident.  The company also stopped production at its Cigar Lake uranium mine in Saskatchewan, Canada, for periods of 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Cigar Lake is the only facility that has returned to operation. The others – McArthur River (Canada), Key Lake (Canada), Rabbit Lake (Canada, Smith Ranch-Highland (US) and Crow Butte (US) – all remain shut down.",
            "In recent years, Cameco has made what it calls “responsible and deliberate decisions” to preserve the value or its uranium assets in an oversupplied market. It has, for example, bought material on the spot market to meet a portion of its long-term supply contracts with utility customers, taking advantage of low prices. ",
            "Since 2016, the cumulative total of uranium Cameco did not produce and bring to market – as a result of operational suspensions, plus the uranium it bought and removed from the market to deliver to customers under existing supply contracts – equals about 145 million pounds of U308. This means 145 million pounds of U308 has been removed from the supply side in recent years, keeping an already low uranium market from falling further and leading to bullish sentiment about a continued recovery."

            "According to Mr Birol, the share of nuclear power generation in Europe could fall from about 20% to about 5% without policy changes – a trend which will bring challenges for energy systems at a time when coal will be getting phased out from the mix.",

            "That report said nuclear output could rise by 40% to 2030 and double by 2050, though its overall share of generation is likely to be below the current 10% in 2050. It warned that staying on the path to net-zero emissions requires “immediate and massive deployment of all available clean and efficient energy technologies”."

            "KGHM president Marcin Chludziński said SMR technology will substantially reduce the company’s operational costs. He said KGHM plans to generate power commercially to help in “the green transformation” of Poland and bring down costs for the average household.",
            "NuScale’s announcement is the latest in a series of SMR-related developments in Poland. Earlier this month, Synthos Green Energy and ZE Pak said they will work together to explore building GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) BWRX-300 or other US SMRs at the site of the Patnow coal plant about 200 km west of Warsaw.",
            "GEH, GEH SMR Technologies Canada, Cameco and Synthos Green Energy are planning to evaluate the potential establishment of a uranium fuel supply chain in Canada capable of servicing a fleet of BWRX-300 reactors in Poland. ",

            "Separately, the Polish government wants to build from 6,000 to 9,000 MW of installed nuclear capacity based on proven, large-scale, pressurised water nuclear reactors of the Generation III and III+ design. Commercial operation of a first nuclear reactor unit in a proposed set of six is earmarked for 2033. Warsaw has not yet announced a technology or investor tender for the project.",
            "In August 2020, the NuScale SMR became the first and so far only SMR to receive design approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, In July 2021, the NRC published the proposed rule that would certify the NuScale design – a crucial step towards the construction and deployment of this SMR technology.",
            "NuScale has said is planning to commercialise its SMR technology by the end of this decade. NuScale and Fluor are working for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (Uamps) to bring what could be the world’s first SMR project to commercialisation. ",
            "Uamps is scheduled to submit a construction licence application in 2023, and is aiming to start commercial operation of the first module in 2029."

            "The inclusion of nuclear alongside renewables and carbon capture will be necessary if the US is to decarbonise its economy rapidly and cost-effectively.",
            "Any attempt at decarbonising America’s power grid by 2035 and the economy by 2050 using renewables alone would require the development of massive amounts of land for hosting solar panels and wind turbines, the statement said. A Princeton University study estimates that if the US wants a carbon-free economy by 2050 using the least amount of land, it must build 250 large nuclear plants, or several thousand stackable small modular reactors at shuttered and retiring fossil fuel-fired power plants.",
            "In this scenario, wind and solar would still contribute 44% of US electricity generation, while 50% would come from emissions-free nuclear and gas-fired generation fitted with carbon-capture technology. The redevelopment of fossil fuel plants into energy-dense advanced reactors or SMRs would help prevent up to 80 million hectares across the US – twice the size of California – from unnecessary development.",
            "The statement said retiring coal plants are ideal locations for SMRs because of their existing grid connections, available water resources, and proximity to where Americans live and work. Factory-built, prefabricated SMRs can come online faster to supplement renewables than any other dispatchable clean energy source.",
            "“By siting reactors at shuttered power plants, the Biden administration can make smart use of the existing power grid to meet the future clean energy needs of America’s heartland and cities,” it said. “This includes supplying electricity for charging the growing fleet of electric vehicles and industrial process heat for manufacturing hydrogen, fuels, fertilisers, steel, and plastics and other chemicals.”",
            "The redevelopment of fossil fuel plants into nuclear plants would tap into the power industry’s existing networks and supply chains to recruit, train, and provide a qualified workforce for nuclear projects."

            "New build projects continue to play a vital role in sustaining employment and enhancing the UK’s skills base. Hinkley Point C, where two new EPR units are under construction, employs around 6,300 people on site with more than 780 apprentices having been trained on the project to date.  EDF announced earlier this year that employment on site will rise to more than 8,000 in the coming years to finish the project. Sizewell C would also deliver thousands of new jobs as a replica of Hinkley, but legislation for a new financing model is needed to capture those benefits, the NIA said.",
            "Innovations in advanced nuclear technology have also driven the sector’s strong employment presence, with a growing workforce led by Rolls Royce developing a small modular reactor – the UKSMR – in the north-Midlands town of Derby and across the country. UKSMR deployment could create 6,000 additional jobs, and the UK is also pursuing advanced gas-cooled designs that would be led by British engineering. ",
            "Elsewhere, the UK’s world-class nuclear fusion research expertise sees more than 2,000 people employed at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy in Oxfordshire.",
            "The nuclear industry remains a vital engine of regional economic development, with more than 24,000 people employed in the North West in decommissioning, fuel cycle research, reactor design and other disciplines. In the South West, the sector employs over 12,900 people, with £3.2bn already spent across the region from the Hinkley Point C project, more than twice the initial target of £1.5bn set at the project’s outset.",

        "text": [
            "Mark Menzies, the Conservative MP whose constituency of Fylde includes the Springfield site, said “one lesson that the pandemic taught us is that when countries – including our closest allies – meet obstacles, they will seek to protect their own interests”. ",
            "“It is simply inconceivable that in the thriving nuclear industry of the future, we may be reliant on overseas markets for the core parts of our reactor supply chain,” he told the debate.",
            "He said the future is full of promise for Springfields and the wider UK nuclear sector, but significant and urgent challenges remain – namely, a short-term drop-off in fuel orders that risks causing redundancies and, more worryingly, the irreplaceable loss of skills. ",
            "At the heart of this is the likelihood of early closure and uncertainty around Dungeness B, Hinkley B and Hunterston. With 70% of site income related to advanced gas-cooled reactor fuel manufacture, that uncertainty has seen a sudden drop-off in demand. Given the possibility that manufacturing on existing orders will end as early as 2023, this really is an urgent situation, and retrospective action cannot resolve the issue.",
            "Mr Menzies said: “We are also waiting on decisions from the government about the next generation of reactors – the small modular reactor fleet – with Sizewell C and other proposals still to be approved. Even with approval, construction will take several years, which means a lengthy gap until Springfields-manufactured fuel is in use. That ambiguity is causing delays in ownership-level decisions about the future, adding to the uncertainty, particularly among the workforce.”",
            "In the short term, to cope with the drop-off in demand, Springfields needs to find sources of income to support continued work and employment. To date, the redundancies have been voluntary, but Mr Menzies said that will likely not be the case going forward for employees, management and the unions.",
            "Mr Menzies called for the government for support to help bridge the gap before the new technology comes into play. The government needs to take a long-term view of the industry, he said. “Given that no similar facility exists in the UK, those skills will be impossible to replace. Many of the people who have taken voluntary redundancy were there as apprentices, and the collective knowledge among those people really is quite something. To lose that is shocking.”",
            "Amanda Solloway, under-secretary of state for science, research and innovation, said the government recognises the importance of maintaining and developing a strong nuclear skills base and she was aware of the plans for redundancies on the Springfields site this year. ",
            "“My department has been working with Westinghouse, the National Nuclear Laboratory and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority to explore opportunities to support the workforce on the Springfields site,” she said. “We will also continue to encourage vendors and developers to maximise their UK supply chain content, including fuel, wherever that is possible, in order to support the economic growth of the UK nuclear sector’s supply chain.”",
            "According to Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the UK Nuclear Industry Association, if the UK wants clean power and energy security, the country “must safeguard” its capacity to produce nuclear fuel domestically. "

            "The reason so many countries are backing SMRs? They are seen as a critical carbon-free technology than can supplement intermittent power sources like wind and solar while being cheaper and easier to build and operate than large plants. In the drive towards net zero, SMRs represent the possibility of nuclear capacity at a much lower cost, with safety characteristics that would allow them to be deployed in places that have never been considered in the past.",
            "Although the NUWARD project was formally launched two years ago, preliminary studies began in 2012 and the project has been supported by the French government since 2017. During an initial seven-year period, partners carried out pre-feasibility studies and completed a pre-conceptual phase, confirming interest in – and the potential of – the project. Following the announcement in 2019, the project entered a three-year conceptual design phase.",
            "Project planning is on schedule and has not been significantly affected the Covid-19 pandemic, mainly because the current phase can be carried remotely. ",
            "The basic design phase – which follows the conceptual design phase – should begin in 2023. Talks have already begun with French nuclear regulator ASN with the aim of licensing the NUWARD reactor, CEA said.",
            "NUWARD is a Generation III pressurised water reactor (PWR) combining two 170 MW reactors for a total output of 340 MW. One of the main characteristics of the plant will be the integration of proven PWR technology into a compact modular configuration. According to EDF, NUWARD will use best in class French technologies from more than 50 years of experience in PWR design, development, construction and more than 2,000 reactor years of PWR operating experience.",
            "The NUWARD will be a multi-purpose plant, with a design that can be adapted for several uses including green hydrogen production, desalinisation and heat cogeneration. This is another key attraction of SMRs – their potential uses beyond the production of electricity for established grids.  The International Energy Agency has noted that SMRs could help provide flexibility in countries with large electricity grids, or be used in countries or regions with small electricity grids that would not be appropriate for large baseload nuclear power plants.",
            "There are no cost estimates for the NUWARD project being made public at this stage, but with the SMR market as competitive as it is, financial considerations will be at the forefront. In the UK, Rolls-Royce is leading a consortium to develop an SMR which it says will initially cost customers about £2.2bn per unit, dropping to £1.8bn by the time five have been completed. This means it will be comparable with offshore wind at around £50/MWh. ",
            "Cost-effectiveness and meeting the market needs were among the reasons that led the French nuclear industry to suspend the 600-MW Astrid project to build a prototype sodium fast breeder reactor at CEA’s Marcoule nuclear site near Avignon in the south of the country. Astrid was intended to be the first of a kind plant in a Generation IV fleet that could be operational by the end of the 21st century, but CEA said “there was no industrial or economic incentive to build such a plant in the near future, whereas there is a market opportunity and a need for SMRs in the next decades”.",
            "“Several countries or customers are expecting the production of SMRs around 2030,” EDF told NucNet. Advanced modular reactors [AMRs] based on Generation IV technologies will follow. Choosing the SMR path means the NUWARD consortium can reduce the time to market and commercialise the plant sooner than would be possible with an AMR.",
            "SMRs are considered as a complementary technology to more traditional large reactors of the kind that are in operation at nuclear stations around the world. These typically range in size from around 1,000 to 1,200 MW. However, the competitiveness of SMRs has yet to be demonstrated. The Nuclear Energy Agency said recently that SMRs could become commercially viable by the early 2030s, but efforts to build the first plants need international collaboration and more government support. ",
            "President Emmanuel Macron has backed the project with €50m as part of a French recovery plan. Courtesy Élysée Palace.",
            "The NUWARD project received €50m as part of a French recovery plan announced at the end of 2020, when president Emmanuel Macron reiterated his support for the country’s nuclear industry and his willingness to back France as a key player in the SMR sector. “Nuclear energy is a decarbonated, safe energy that should remain a cornerstone of our energy mix,” Mr Macron said.",
            "The NEA said the most optimistic deployment scenarios for SMRs assume successful licensing and the establishment of the factory production and associated supply chain that would lead to cost competitiveness. If SMRs are manufactured in a mass fashion, similar to commercial aircraft, the economic benefits could be significant, the NEA said. But this would require that the market for a single design be relatively large and raises the possibility that only a small number of the many designs under development will ultimately succeed.",
            "TechnicAtome said it is confident in the NUWARD project because it is based on a mature, well-known Generation III technology. The company said this type of reactor is similar to one it is assembling and commissioning for French nuclear-powered submarines, so the technology already exists in a different form. Russia is also adapting reactors used in its new generation icebreakers. State nuclear corporation Rosatom said it is planning to build a land-based SMR in Yakutia, also known as Sakha, an autonomous republic 4,000 km to the east of Moscow, between Siberia and Russia’s far east. It is aiming to begin construction in 2024 and commission the unit by 2028.",
            "Meanwhile, SMR projects around the world are taking shape. One of the latest is in the US, where power companies run by billionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have chosen Wyoming to launch the first Natrium nuclear reactor project on the site of a retiring coal plant. “This is our fastest and clearest course to becoming carbon negative,” Wyoming’s governor, Mark Gordon, said. “Nuclear power is clearly a part of my all-of-the-above strategy for energy” in Wyoming, the country’s top coal-producing state.",
            "The potential global market for SMRs has been estimated at more than $10bn by 2027. Some research companies have put the value at $325bn by 2035. France, and the consortium behind NUWARD, have an eye on this huge potential with EDF saying the technology will be a competitive solution and that NUWARD partners are open to international cooperation. EDF chairman Jean-Bernard Lévy called NUWARD “a promising beginning of a safe and competitive nuclear design meant to broaden the range of solutions for low-carbon baseload energy offered by the French nuclear industry.” ",
            "The challenge ahead is to build a working prototype of the NUWARD and get a commercial version to market – before the competition."

            "Thermochemical water splitting – the direct splitting of water using very high temperature heat from advanced modular nuclear facilities – could be in operation by the mid to late 2030s, although further innovation work will be needed to develop the commercial technology.",
            "“From the 2030s onwards, we may see a wider range of production technologies coming to the market including more hydrogen from nuclear, using low carbon heat and power from small modular and advanced modular reactors, as well as bio-hydrogen with CCUS [carbon capture, utilisation and storage] that can deliver negative emissions,” the strategy says. “A dynamic market will include multiple sources and end uses for hydrogen.”",
            "Using nuclear plants to produce hydrogen would involve transmitting electricity produced by a reactor to electrolysers, which would produce green, or low-carbon hydrogen for industry, transport and home heating, at the sites where the hydrogen is needed. The technology is not yet mature, and remains expensive, but proponents say it could help bring about the transition to a zero-carbon hydrogen-based economy without the need for fossil fuels.",
            "The government said the hydrogen strategy is set to support over 9,000 UK jobs and unlock £4bn investment by 2030. A UK-wide hydrogen economy could be worth £900m and create over 9,000 jobs by 2030, potentially rising to 100,000 jobs and worth up to £13 billion by 2050. ",
            "By 2030, hydrogen could play an important role in decarbonising polluting, energy-intensive industries like chemicals, oil refineries, power and heavy transport like shipping, HGV lorries and trains, by helping these sectors move away from fossil fuels. ",
            "Government analysis suggests that 20-35% of the UK’s energy consumption by 2050 could be hydrogen-based and the new energy source could be critical to meeting the UK’s targets of net zero emissions by 2050 and cutting emissions by 78% by 2035.",
            "An energy white paper, published in December 2020, has already set out how the UK will expand renewable generation while decarbonising power sector emissions, including through new large-scale nuclear while investing in small-scale nuclear technologies.",
            "In November 2020, prime minister Boris Johnson set out an ambitious 10-point plan for “a green industrial revolution” that included investing £525m to help develop large and smaller-scale nuclear plants, and research and develop new advanced modular reactors.",
            "A government-backed report in July said the UK can achieve net zero on time and affordably by 2050 if it “immediately and fully” recognises the opportunities offered by green hydrogen from nuclear plants, although it must put in place stronger industry and government collaboration to deploy the technology “at pace”.",
            "The London-based Nuclear Industry Association welcomed the hydrogen strategy, saying it confirms that nuclear reactors, large, small, current and advanced, have a critical role in producing low-carbon hydrogen. ",
            "“The government must now swiftly implement a new financing model for nuclear to cut costs, move forward with Sizewell C, and continue to support the development of modular reactors, to ensure nuclear is part of a strong low-carbon hydrogen mix,” NIA chief executive Tom Greatrex, said."

            "At present, nuclear energy from France makes up the bulk of the imports, followed by Belgium. On most days, Britain imports almost 3 GW worth of nuclear power from Europe, which is close to the equivalent output of the proposed Sizewell C nuclear station in Suffolk at 3.2 GW, or of six units of a small modular reactor. In July, imported nuclear energy gave London and the Southeast’s power grids an improved low-carbon performance, but without the added economic benefits of domestic nuclear power in the form of investment and jobs.",
            "Nuclear was the leading British zero-carbon generator in July with 15% of the mix. Most of this fleet, however, will retire by the end of March 2024. Grid decarbonisation progress is also stalling: 2021 is the first year since 2012 in which grid carbon intensity in the year-to-date has risen. Britain is also currently on a 40-day coal burning streak, which is more than it burned over a seven-month period from April 10th to November 5th 2020.",
            "NIA chief executive Tom Greatrex Britain must invest in new nuclear projects. “If we are happy enough to rely on French and Belgian nuclear power, we should be happy enough to build our own,” he said. “Unless we act now to build new nuclear capacity, the gap will be filled by more gas bought from volatile global markets or power imported from Europe, and the jobs and skills sustained by those stations will go.”",
            "Two EPRs under construction at Hinkley Point C in southwest England are the only nuclear units being buit in Britain. They are being partially bankrolled by China’s state-owned nuclear energy company China General Nuclear (CGN) as part of a wider deal with French company EDF to replace the UK's aging nuclear plants.",

EDF of France and CGN are 80% and 20% shareholders in the project to build two EPR units at the site. Plans for Bradwell, where CGN and EDF are planning to build a single HPR1000, or Hualong One plant, remain in the early technical stages.",

            "According to the NIA, of the country’s existing fleet of 13 nuclear units, only the 1,198-MW pressurised water reactor at Sizewell B is scheduled to be operational after 2030."

In addition, thanks to also generating extremely high temperature heat, they could help decarbonise industry and potentially power district heating networks by the 2040s.",
            "Around one-third of the UK’s carbon emissions come from heat, with a significant portion from heavy industrial processes. By generating heat at between 500°C and 950°C – higher than other types of advanced reactor – HTGRs could significantly cut emissions from processes such as cement, paper, glass and chemical production in the UK’s industrial heartlands.",

The call for evidence seeks to strengthen the government’s evidence base around the potential of advanced modular reactors and HTGRs in particular.",
            "Energy minister Anne Marie Trevelyan said while renewables like wind and solar will become an integral part of where the country’s electricity will come from by 2050, they will always require a stable low-carbon baseload from nuclear. “That is why, alongside negotiations with the developers of Sizewell C in Suffolk, we are pressing ahead with harnessing new and exciting advanced nuclear technology.”",
            "The government said today’s step builds on the commitment made in the energy white paper and prime minister Boris Johnson’s 10-point plan for £170m of investment in an R&D programme for advanced SMRs, as part of a £385m package to accelerate the development of more flexible nuclear technologies.",

Internationally – as part of the Generation IV International Forum for further research and development – there are six main types of advanced SMR technology, which could play a role in achieving net zero, with some potentially re-using spent nuclear materials as new fuel. However, with one of the highest temperature outputs, HTGRs are being considered for the UK’s demonstrator programme.",

            "It indicates that in a future carbon-free electricity sector, deployment of advanced SMRs would be competitive if the projected levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for these designs can be attained. An LCOE for an nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) SMR in the range of $51/MWh-$54/MWh was calculated for the NuScale reactor. For GE-Hitachi’s BWRX-300 SMR the LCOE was calculated in the range of $44-$51/MWh.",
            "NuScale said recently that Uamps, its first customer for its SMR, had set an LCOE target of $55/MWh.",
            "LCOE captures both capital and operating costs that need to be covered. It is essentially the long-term price at which the electricity produced by a power plant will have to be sold at for the investor to cover all their costs.",
            "The report warns that SMRs may face competition from other firm power sources. The US Energy Information Administration estimates geothermal entering the market in 2025 at $37/MWh, while advanced geothermal is estimated to cost $47/MWh. Entities can get a $2/MWh tax credit that reduces the cost to $35–$45/MWh if the project is properly structured.",
            "Legislative changes in the Pacific Northwest, notably in Washington State, are driving the electricity sector to be carbon neutral by 2030 and ultimately carbon-free by 2045, the report says. “The legislative changes have stimulated renewed interest in nuclear power as a sustainable, carbon-free source of firm, flexible electricity.”",
            "PNNL’s manager for nuclear power systems Ali Zbib, who co-wrote the report, said nuclear energy is a reliable source of baseload electricity and the findings show that advanced SMRs could be economically competitive in a future carbon-free electricity sector. ",
            "The findings outline advantages of building at each site, from a trained workforce residing in Eastern Washington to infrastructure in place at the Centralia plant. The report focused on two designs: NuScale’s small modular reactor and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300.",
            "Last week NuScale and Grant County Public Utility District (Grant PUD) signed a memorandum of understanding to evaluate the deployment of NuScale’s nuclear technology in Central Washington.",
            "The two parties will work together to support Grant PUD’s due diligence process in evaluating energy solutions. The deployment of NuScale’s SMR design would meet the demands of Grant PUD’s customers and with “acceptable and affordable cost certainty”, NuScale said."

            "At its peak in the early 2030s, global nuclear capacity additions could reach 30 GW per year, five‐times the rate of the past decade. In advanced economies, lifetime extensions for existing reactors are pursued in many countries as they are one of the most cost‐effective sources of low‐carbon electricity, while new construction expands to about 4.5 GW per year on average from 2021 to 2035, with an increasing emphasis on small modular reactors (SMRs). ",
            "Despite these efforts, the nuclear share of total generation in advanced economies could fall from 18% in 2020 to 10% in 2050, the report warns. Two‐thirds of new nuclear capacity is built in emerging market and developing economies mainly in the form of large-scale reactors. This raises the share of nuclear in electricity generation in those countries from 5% in 2020 to 7% in 2050. Nuclear could also meet 4% of commercial heat demand in 2050.",
            "The outlook for nuclear is outlined in the report’s “net‐zero emissions by 2050” scenario (NZE), which describes how energy demand and the energy mix will need to evolve if the world is to achieve net‐zero emissions by 2050. Other scenarios in the report are based on existing policies and pledges. In these scenarios nuclear power increases steadily too, maintaining its global market share of about 10%, led by increases in China. Nuclear output could increase from 10% to 25%.",
            "The report calls for important decisions to be made concerning nuclear power, notably on lifetime extensions, the pace of new construction and the extent of government support for advanced nuclear technologies, particularly those related to small modular reactors and high‐temperature gas reactors, both of which can expand markets for nuclear power beyond electricity.",
            "The report warns that without further lifetime extensions and new projects beyond those already under construction, nuclear power output in advanced economies will decline by two‐thirds over the next two decades.",
            "The IEA warns that climate pledges by governments to date – even if fully achieved – would fall well short of what is required to bring global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to net-zero by 2050 and give the world an even chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 °C.",
            "The NZE roadmap sets out more than 400 milestones to guide the global journey to net-zero by 2050. These include, from today, no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, and no further final investment decisions for new unabated coal plants. By 2035, there are no sales of new internal combustion engine passenger cars. By 2040, the global electricity sector could have already reached net-zero emissions.",
            "IEA executive director Fatih Birol said: “Our roadmap shows the priority actions that are needed today to ensure the opportunity of net-zero emissions by 2050 – narrow but still achievable – is not lost. ",
            "“The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal – our best chance of tackling climate change and limiting global warming to 1.5 °C – make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced.”"

            "“During this shift, the government plans to rely on nuclear power generation to meet the major electricity demand. Nuclear power generation was 15.9 TWh in 2020, making its share 44% in total power generation in the country and this is expected to remain above 40% until 2030.”",
            "Mr Vyakaranam said Bulgaria has taken multiple steps towards the development of nuclear power in recent times including joining the Nuclear Energy Agency in January 2021. Kozloduy NPP signed a memorandum of understanding with US-based NuScale Power for the deployment of NuScale’s small modular reactor technology. ",
            "In October 2020, Bulgaria and the US signed what they called key documents related to nuclear energy for civilian purposes. Prime minister Boyko Borisov said nuclear energy is one of the greener and cleaner energies and that is why “we want to use more secure technology of the latest generation and achieve the diversification of nuclear fuel”.",

            "Foratom said the bloc should support innovation, research and development into all low-carbon hydrogen projects. The EU also needs to pay more attention to economic aspects and supply reliability – both are key issues for industry – to ensure rapid development of clean hydrogen projects at a more competitive cost.",
            "“The EU has set itself the very ambitious target of decarbonising its economy by 2050. Achieving this will require a massive transformation of the energy, industry, transport and building sectors”, Foratom director-general Yves Desbazeille said. “Hydrogen is one of the technologies which could help Europe reach its goals. But two challenges remain: producing real low-carbon hydrogen and expanding its use to a broad range of energy intensive sectors that need it.”",
            "“There are several nuclear-to-hydrogen projects in the pipeline”, Mr Desbazeille said. “Whilst this technology is a viable solution, we have to make sure that the EU puts in place the right policy incentives to expand its development further”.",
            "Hydrogen can be produced through electrolysis, a process of making it from nothing more than electricity and water. Electricity from a nuclear plant – or from renewable energy facilities – can be transmitted by the existing grid infrastructure to electrolysers, which produce hydrogen for industry, transport and home heating, at the sites where the hydrogen is needed.",
            "According to Foratom, the advantage of making use of all low-carbon electricity sources for hydrogen production is two-fold.  First, it will ensure that there is enough hydrogen available at all times as an increasing number of sectors switch to this energy carrier. Second, running an electrolyser for longer periods reduces the costs of the technology.",

            "The UK-based Royal Society said in a recent policy briefing that nuclear energy has the potential to help the UK to achieve net zero-carbon emissions by 2050, not only through the generation of low-carbon electricity but also by using reactor heat to produce hydrogen."

            "The paper says small modular and advanced nuclear plants are coming to the market before the end of this decade and have the potential to be deployed in a wider range of locations, some of which would be unsuitable for large-scale reactors. Once available, they might help to cut the cost of electricity as production is scaled up.",
            "New nuclear power plant construction also has a positive impact on local economies. At peak construction, 3,500 workers are needed to build the plant. A single plant requires approximately 340,000 cubic metres of concrete and 66,000 tonnes of steel, a significant boost to suppliers of these materials.",
            "The paper also notes that in contrast to some fossil fuel-based industries, nuclear energy is a clean technology with no adverse consequences for air quality and very high safety standards. “Investment in clean energy could and should be at the forefront of the post-Covid",
            "economic recovery, particularly in emerging markets,” the paper says. “The long life of nuclear plants makes them stable employers who provide highly skilled and highly paid reliable work with excellent opportunities for women.”"

He said the Wylfa Newydd site and the Oldbury site in southwest England, where Hitachi was also planning two UK ABWRs, are “highly suitable” for nuclear new build and remain capable of substantially supporting UK energy policy. ",
            "The Wylfa Newydd site benefits from a decade of major investment and development and is too important to the net zero agenda and the economic future of Anglesey and North Wales, for that progress to be wasted, Mr Hawthorne said.",

            "The construction of at least one additional nuclear power plant would provide a significant boost to energy security while 14 of the UK’s 15 commercial nuclear power stations are decommissioned by 2030. It would complement the country’s booming renewables portfolio and help to manage periods of variability.",
            "The nuclear closures translate to a loss of 7.7 GW of reliable, zero-emission generating capacity. The construction of two EPR plants at Hinkley Point C in Somerset will replace some of the shortfall, but the report says there is a risk that without more capacity, the UK will have to prolong its dependence on fossil fuels – which would exacerbate climate change.",
            "The construction of another nuclear power station would have other benefits for the energy system, the report says. New nuclear reactors can be engineered so that some of the heat they produce can be used for purposes other than electricity generation. For example, heat could be piped to nearby businesses or homes for general heating. Heat can also increase the efficiency of hydrogen production, which could be used to decarbonise parts of the economy where electrification is harder, such as for certain forms of heavy transport or industrial processes.",
            "Analysis in the report shows how wind and solar provided less than 20% of daily electricity demand on 82 separate occasions in 2020, including a period of over a week in August and a week in November.",
            "To support the development of new nuclear facilities, the think-tank recommends exploring innovative financing methods, such as the regulated asset base model, which would allow developers to charge consumers a set amount before electricity generation begins. This could cut borrowing costs and lead to cheaper energy prices for families and businesses.",
            "Renewed investment in nuclear energy could maintain skills and knowledge, ensuring the UK is well-placed to spearhead the next generation of nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors and fusion reactors.",

            "A working group was formed and a deadline set for the report of 31 January 2021.",
            "Bulgarian energy minister Temenuzhka Petkova said the working group had been in communication with US-based Westinghouse, who have said they would “support the realisation of a seventh unit at Kozloduy using existing equipment we own from the Belene nuclear project”.",
            "The government press service said the ministry of energy should now prepare a financial model for the project and carry out a legal analysis of the national, European and international legal framework. The ministry should also continue to examine the option of deploying small modular reactors, it said.",
            "What Next For Belene?",
            "It remains unclear what the Kozloduy proposal means for the two-unit Belene project, proposed for a new site about 160km east of Kozloduy and set to use Russia-supplied nuclear technology. ",
            "The Bulgarian government had been calling for investors to join the project, including Russia’s Rosatom, China’s CNNC and South Korea’s KHNP. France’s Framatone and US-based General Electric had also been interested to provide equipment of the project.",
            "Kozloduy, on the Danube River in northwest Bulgaria, is the country’s only nuclear power station. It houses six reactor units, but only two VVER-1000 PWRs are in commercial operation with four older VVERs under decommissioning. The operational Kozloduy-5 and -6 supplied 37% of Bulgaria’s electricity in 2019.",
            "In 2012, Bulgaria began talking about a seventh reactor unit at Kozloduy. This was at a time when the Belene project had been halted because of financing concerns and a failure to find investors. A proposed expansion of Kozloduy received a positive environmental impact assessment the same year, according to earlier reports.",
            "US-based Westinghouse was at the time invited to build a single AP1000 pressurised water reactor unit at Kozloduy. Negotiations began on a shareholders’ agreement, but were never concluded.",
            "After losing an international arbitration case to Russia in 2016, Bulgaria had to pay €600m to Russian suppliers for the bulk of the nuclear equipment ordered for Belene. As a result, in 2018, the government formally revived the project.",
            "With the revival of the Belene project, it seemed the government had sidelined new-build plans for Kozloduy. However, in October 2020 prime minister Boiko Borisov announced his government might be looking to revive the project.",

            "Cost of using reactors for production would be lower than wind, report also concludes",
            "Nuclear-produced hydrogen could make a sizeable contribution to the development of the hydrogen economy in the UK and Europe, but progress will depend on the adoption of technology-neutral policies which do not discriminate against nuclear power, a think-tank says in a new report. ",
            "",
            "The pro-nuclear New Nuclear Watch Institute report makes a case for technology-neutrality in policies designed to boost the clean hydrogen sector. Policies should acknowledge that both renewable energy and nuclear power are low-carbon sources of hydrogen production and should be treated equally. ",
            "",
            "The report concludes that using nuclear power to produce hydrogen using electrolyser technology has several advantages compared to using intermittent renewables.",
            "",
            "One of those advantages is cost. According to the report hydrogen produced from nuclear plants would cost $5.63/kg This compares to $9.81/kg to $12.46/kg for new, dedicated wind and $27.12/kg for balancing wind.",
            "The report finds that per unit of installed electrolyser capacity, nuclear power can produce 5.45 and 2.23 times as much clean hydrogen as solar and wind power respectively. The report highlights that the land area required to produce hydrogen using nuclear power is considerably lower than that required by renewable energy sources. It suggests that an offshore wind farm would require 1,400 times as much land area to produce as much hydrogen as a traditional GW-scale nuclear power plant.",
            "NNWI chairman Tim Yeo, a former MP and environment minister, said the report shows how using nuclear power rather than intermittent renewable energy to produce hydrogen allows electrolyser technology to operate at a far higher capacity factor and so provide a stronger stimulus to the development of a robust hydrogen economy. “Choosing nuclear is a no brainer for any government wanting to ramp up hydrogen production quickly,” he said.",
            "Potential major uses for clean hydrogen include industries such as oil refineries, and ammonia, methanol and steel production. It could also be used for heavy goods road vehicles, rail, aviation and shipping.",
            "However, there are obstacles. Current hydrogen production is carbon-intensive, small-scale and expensive. Electrolyser capacity needs to be scaled up because most are no more than 10 MW. Hydrogen infrastructure is limited and low supply and low demand are acting as a break on incentivising infrastructure.",
            "The report explores the possible development of EU hydrogen policy, taking into consideration the European Commission’s hydrogen strategy published in July 2020. The study says that the EU’s decision to set its long-term aim on purely “renewable hydrogen” production, at the expense of other ‘low-carbon sources of production such as nuclear power, could delay investment in the infrastructure needed for a broad-based hydrogen economy. ",
            "According to the NNWI, nuclear-produced hydrogen would bring multiple benefits to the development of the European hydrogen system, as acknowledged by the French national hydrogen strategy, which sees a clear and valuable role for nuclear-produced hydrogen.",
            "The Covid-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to use the spare capacity of nuclear power to produce hydrogen and accelerate the development of a European hydrogen economy.",
            "The UK government said in an energy white paper released earlier this week that it would work with industry for 5GW of low-carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030. The white paper said advanced nuclear reactors could unlock efficient production of hydrogen and synthetic fuels.",
            "Hydrogen can be produced through electrolysis, a process of making it from nothing more than electricity and water. Electricity from a nuclear plant can be transmitted by the existing grid infrastructure to electrolysers, which produce hydrogen for industry, transport and home heating, at the sites where the hydrogen is needed.",
            "A number of governments, including the US, the UK and Canada, are exploring the possibility of using existing nuclear plants to produce hydrogen.",
            "In July, 15 companies and trade unions, including France’s state-controlled power company EDF and several engineering firms, announced proposals for a clean energy hub in the UK including up to three EPR reactors, small modular reactors and the production of hydrogen.",
            "The Royal Society said in a recent policy briefing that nuclear energy has the potential to help the UK to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, not only through the generation of low-carbon electricity but also by using reactor heat to produce hydrogen."

            "Small Modular Reactors",
            "The white paper says SMRs are usually based on proven water-cooled reactors similar to current nuclear power station reactors, but on a smaller scale. They use nuclear fission to generate low-carbon electricity. SMRs are called modular reactors as their components can be manufactured in factories using innovative techniques and then transported to site to be assembled.",
            "Advanced Modular Reactors",
            "These are reactors which use novel cooling systems or fuels and may offer new functionalities such as industrial process heat. These reactors could operate at over 800°C and the high-grade heat could unlock efficient production of hydrogen and synthetic fuels."

            "The administration’s budget for 2021 says nuclear energy is critical to the nation’s energy mix. The budget supports various programmes to advance nuclear energy technologies. It promotes the revitalisation of the domestic industry and the ability of domestic technologies to compete abroad. The Budget provides $1.2bn for R&D and other important nuclear energy programmes, including nearly $300m for the construction of the Versatile Test Reactor – a first of its kind fast reactor that would help the private sector develop and demonstrate new technologies.",
            "The budget notes that on 12 July 2019, the president determined that “...the United States uranium industry faces significant challenges in producing uranium domestically and that this is an issue of national security.” The budget establishes a uranium reserve for the US to provide additional assurances of availability of uranium in the event of a market disruption.

In February 2020, using his preferred medium of Twitter, Trump announced he was no longer supporting a repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, a state he is targeting after narrowly losing it to Hillary Clinton in 2016. He wrote: “Nevada, I hear you on Yucca Mountain and my Administration will RESPECT you!” He also pledged to find “innovative approaches” to find a new place to store the 90,000 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel being stored at 120 temporary storage sites – an impasse that could cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.",

In 2012 he said Indiana’s future energy supply must come from a variety of sources that will likely include nuclear power. As candidate for Indiana governor, a post he held from 2013 to 2017, Pence said nuclear power “should be a part of our conversation as we explore strategies for meeting our future energy needs”. ",

She said: “Yucca Mountain – that's a nonstarter for me. The kind of disposal that has happened at Yucca Mountain – and also taking away that state's ability to make decisions – this administration was, in the middle of the night, carting waste in to Yucca Mountain without the authority and the permission of the leaders of the state of Nevada. Asked about phasing out nuclear energy, she reportedly said: “We have to figure out what we’re going to do about the waste. My bottom-line is that I’m not going to allow the federal government to go in and impose its priorities on any state – it’s going to have to be those states who make that decision.”",
            "Harris appeared to support the development of next generation nuclear technologies. She said: “Utilities and scientists are developing nuclear power reactors that are much smaller than the massive facilities that have been used in past decades. The new reactors, called small modular reactors that the Energy Department’s national labs are helping to develop, would produce perhaps 50 to 100 megawatts.”"

It has another eight under construction and 11 more planned in Finland, Belarus, India Hungary, Egypt, Turkey, Bangladesh and China. Rosatom says it has 36 units in its global order portfolio, almost all in emerging markets, although not all of these have been formally confirmed. It says the portfolio is worth about $130bn over the next 10 years.",
            "The growth of Russia’s nuclear energy industry is worrying US politicians and observers, who say the US needs to reform its nuclear sector if it is to compete. Energy secretary Dan Brouillette said many countries of geopolitical importance are pursuing nuclear energy for their domestic electricity needs. Those countries are largely turning to Russian (and sometimes Chinese) state-owned enterprises for the technological support needed to build reactors, while the US sits on the sidelines. “In effect, China and Russia are gaining geopolitical leverage by exporting nuclear expertise and building 100-year bilateral relationships,” he said.",
            "The US has already reacted to Russia’s dominance in the sector by lifting a legacy prohibition that prevented the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) funding nuclear energy projects overseas.",
            "The DFC, a federal agency, said the move reflected the vast energy needs of developing countries and the potential of new and advanced technologies such as small modular reactors and microreactors in these markets. Modernising the DFC’s nuclear energy policy will help deliver a secure power source to developing countries to promote economic growth and affordable energy access in underserved communities.",
            "Meanwhile, Rosatom is heading an expansive and aggressive international strategy for Russia, aiming at building new nuclear power units and at establishing new relations and cooperation in the coming years.",
            "Nuclear energy is seen as a hugely significant export, one that could compete with fossil fuel sources in energy net importer countries, or in countries where energy demand will constantly increase, like developing economies in Asia and Africa. It also allows countries doing the exporting to get a foot in the door of emerging economies in areas of the globe where potential economic cooperation is vast.",
            "Part of Rosatom’s appeal is Russia’s lower prices and state-of-the-art technology. Another big draw for those looking for a nuclear supplier is the fact that Russia usually provides most of the financing for its nuclear plants. For four units Russia is building a Akkuyu, at an unconfirmed cost of $20bn, Rosatom is supplying financing. In return, it is also the co-owner of the facility, gaining returns on its investments during operation from electricity sales.",
            "Underpinning the business is politics. Russia has long used energy as the sweetener when offering a package of trade deals to its international partners.

But he warned that nuclear in Africa is challenging because of its instability and high levels of corruption. He told NucNet that investors are concerned that after a couple of years there will be a difficult election and a messy change of government, and “everything is different”. He called for an ‘energy charter’ for Africa, as in Europe after the end of the Cold War, to protect international investments in the sector. “This would encourage the development of nuclear and other sources to generate electricity in Africa,” he said."

            "Most of the growth in nuclear capacity relies on existing nuclear reactor designs. Some advanced nuclear technologies, notably small modular reactors (SMRs), support the rising share of variable renewables. Today SMRs are at the prototype development stage, but their potential for shorter lead times and lower investment requirements reduce investment risks compared with large-scale nuclear plants.",
            "The IEA includes nuclear in its definition of clean energy sources, but warns in the report that one of the main changes in the power sector since 2000 has been the stagnation of nuclear power, with a sharp slowdown in the rate of commissioning new reactors, especially in advanced economies. ",
            "The number of construction starts for new nuclear power plants slumped in the late 1980s and 1990s in the wake of lower fossil fuel prices and accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, but started to pick up again in the late 2000s, mainly in emerging economies. Interest in building new nuclear plants then fell again after the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear accident. Today there are 54 nuclear power reactors under construction, 39 of which are in emerging economies.",
            "Cumulative emissions savings related to the increased contribution of renewables in power generation since 2000 are estimated at 16 Gt. The equivalent cumulative emissions savings figure related to nuclear power generation is 30 Gt.",
            "In the SDS, electricity demand expands by 30,000 TWh, which means that each year to 2070 sees electricity demand equivalent to the current annual demand of Mexico and the UK combined be added to the world power system. This would call for a push towards far more use of solar, wind and other renewables, as well as nuclear power.",
            "Under the SDS nuclear primary energy use more than doubles between 2019 and 2070, with emerging economies in Asia accounting for around 75% of the growth in capacity. Nuclear meets 13% of total generation in 2070 in China – more than three times the current share.",
            "The share of renewables, including hydropower and solid biomass, jumps from around 15% in 2019 to more than 60% in 2070. Solar energy, which is used for power generation and for heating purposes in buildings and industry, becomes by 2070 the largest primary energy resource, accounting for more than 20% of global primary energy demand.",
            "The share of renewables in the global power generation mix reaches 86% in 2070, with the remaining 14% of power from nuclear plants (8%), fossil fuel plants with CCUS (5%) and hydrogen (1%).",
            "The report concludes that a major effort to develop and deploy clean energy technologies worldwide is urgently needed to meet international energy and climate goals, particularly in order to reduce carbon emissions from areas beyond the power sector such as transport, buildings and industry.",
            "With global carbon emissions at unacceptably high levels, structural changes to the energy system are required to achieve the rapid and lasting decline in emissions called for by the world’s shared climate targets. The report analyses more than 800 different technology options to assess what would need to happen to reach net-zero emissions by 2070 while ensuring a resilient and secure energy system.",
            "The report says innovation needs sufficient funding to generate a steady pipeline of new ideas. It calls on governments to mitigate the investment risks of key large-scale demonstrations for new clean energy technologies. These may include new nuclear designs, carbon capture and storage, and floating offshore wind power – all of which face high capital costs for the first commercial projects."

            "There are various types of advanced, or Generation IV, reactors. Some can be constructed as small modular reactors, which may offer a potential for lower capital costs and faster construction. Light water-cooled SMRs, high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, and sodium-cooled fast reactors are among potential next-generation technologies. ",

            "“The primary challenge in siting a deep geologic nuclear waste repository, such as Yucca Mountain, is obtaining local consent,” the report said. It called for Congress to continue to pursue a legislative solution to the nuclear waste problem, which should include consent-based siting for any permanent repository for nuclear waste. The DOE should prioritise accepting high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel from decommissioned civilian nuclear power reactors in high population areas and high earthquake hazard areas.",
            "In 2010, under the Obama administration, the Department of Energy declared Yucca Mountain “unworkable” and the project was stopped.",
            "In 2017, president Donald Trump signalled renewed support for Yucca Mountain with the White House pledging $120m of funding in its 2018 federal budget proposal to restart licensing procedures at the site, but the proposal was ultimately dropped by Congress.",
            "The report said next-generation nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors could be a promising source of zero-carbon electricity, but many challenges remain, including safety, proliferation risks, and cost. It said the country’s regulator, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, “will need to play an active oversight role for these technologies”.",
            "The report recommended that Congress should direct the DOE to provide support for first-of-a-kind or early deployment nuclear power technologies, such as SMRs, through R&D, federal financing, loan guarantees, other types of federal credit, or a pilot programme for a long-term power purchase agreement for federal agencies."

            "In December 2019 the US Department of Energy granted a site use permit to Oklo to build a demonstration Aurora plant on the Idaho National Laboratory site.",
            "The Aurora is an advanced fission power system that consists of a small reactor with integrated solar panels. It uses liquid metal to move fission heat out of the reactor core and into a secondary power generation system and generates approximately 1.5 MW of power. ",
            "Oklo has said it has budgeted “in the order of” $10m for construction and $3m a year for operations of the Aurora plant.",
            "On fuel cycle costs Oklo said that because of the type of reactor and fuel cycle, only a single core load is required for the licence lifetime of 20 years.",
            "The Aurora will generate both usable heat and electricity, run for at least 20 years on one load of fuel and operate without the need for water. The plant can also recycle fuel and ultimately convert nuclear waste to clean energy.",
            "Oklo, which is solely venture-funded and backed primarily by US-based investors, announced last year that it had successfully demonstrated prototypes of a metallic fuel at INL for the Aurora reactor. It said it had fabricated prototypes with multiple fuel elements reaching production specification.",
            "Oklo would use high-assay low-enriched uranium (Haleu) fuel. However, in common with many other advanced reactor developers, the lack of reliable access to Haleu remains a challenge – one that Congress has set its sights on addressing. ",
            "The sooner Oklo can “have access to be able to work with that, the faster we’re going to be able to actually get something built,” company co-founder Jacob DeWitte said.",
            "Haleu fuel has many advantages that improve reactor performance. Because the fissionable isotope U235 is more concentrated in Haleu fuel, the fuel assemblies and reactors can be smaller, which is one reason why many small modular reactor designs will run on Haleu. The reactors do not need to be refuelled as often, and they can achieve higher burnup rates, which means less fuel will be required and less waste will be produced."

            "He said the industry’s calls for market reforms that would reward the security of baseload nuclear energy are legitimate, but warned that the nuclear sector needs to evolve to reflect the market. “The market is not going to change overnight,” he said. “It’s going to take a long time for it to be reformed.",
            "“It would be to the nuclear sector’s advantage to have products that fit the budgets of current customers under current circumstance.”",
            "Cost is one of the issues driving the market to consider smaller reactors. This is because the initial capital needed is so much less than for traditional large light-water reactors (LWRs) of the kind that have been under construction and faced delays and cost overruns at Vogtle in the US, Flamanville-3 in France and Olkiluoto-3 in Finland. Instead of talking about an investment of $10bn or more, small modular reactors, or SMRs, might make it to market for around $1bn billion, Mr Magwood said. That is much more “in the affordability range” for a lot of customers and has inevitably created a lot of interest.",
            "However, Mr Magwood said he does not agree with the notion that the industry has seen the last of the large reactors. If SMRs are as successful as a lot of people hope, the first examples could begin construction by the mid-2020s and replace some large LWRs in the future. “But until they [SMRs] are on the market, until they are real, it’s hard to say,” Mr Magwood said.",
            "Last month the author of a think-tank report said the Vogtle-3 and -4 nuclear power plants under construction in Georgia could become the last large-capacity reactors to be built in the US, with SMRs and other Generation IV advanced reactors taking over as key technologies.",
            "Jane Nakano, a senior fellow specialising in energy security and climate change at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said she “would not be surprised” if the two Westinghouse AP1000 units were the last large commercial units in the US.",
            "But Mr Magwood said technology like the AP1000 being used at Vogtle is \"excellent\" and “probably the safest large reactor technology that’s been built”. ",
            "However, the Vogtle project has shown that for any first-of-a-kind project you are going to run into some issues, Mr Magwood said. “The good news on all of this is that Vogtle-3 and Vogtle-4 plants are almost complete and we will see this technology in operation.”",
            "AP1000s have already been built in China and are operating extremely well. “I have talked to Chinese officials about the AP1000 and they are operating extraordinarily well, they are very pleased with the plants. The question is, what’s the market for the future?”",
            "A lot depends on what demand looks like. In some countries, particularly emerging economies like China and India, there is very large growth in electricity demand. More people are moving from rural areas to urban areas. Factories are being built. The need for electricity increases. In Western Europe and North America, electricity demand is flat, increasing by about one percent or less a year. ",
            "In contrast to the large LWRs like the AP1000s at Vogtle, SMRs fit into systems where electricity demand is not as large, Mr Magwood said.",
            "“In countries like the US, the question is not really of meeting growing demand, but more of switching to modern technologies to replace old coal plants that are going offline,” he said. The issue is mostly one of replacing existing capacity, not meeting increased demand.",
            "“And that kind of market doesn’t lend itself to very large investments in plant equipment like it used to. Which makes SMRs more attractive than in markets where large reactors are needed to meet growing demand. ",
            "“This is still somewhere where I think the large reactors play a role,” Mr Magwood said.  “They play a role where there is large demand growth, but they also play a role in situations where you need to retire very large facilities. ",
            "“If there are large coal plants that have to go offline because they are too old, or even old nuclear plants, that presents an opportunity to replace that capacity with new large capacity. ",
            "“And in those cases, the traditional large plants might fit. But that's something that has to decided on a case-by-case basis.”",
            "Generation IV SMRs are still in the design stage, but construction and operation are coming. In the US, NuScale’s SMR – a fully factory-fabricated module capable of generating 60 MW of electricity using a scaled-down version of PWR technology – is the first to be going through the regulatory approval process in the US and could be on the market by the end of the year “as a real product”. That will be the first step to see what the small reactor revolution might look like. ",
            "Mr Magwood also addressed the issue of financing new nuclear, saying that if the market was completely open and took into account the full system costs of all technologies, nuclear would probably be better off. But he pointed out that “it’s always important to recognise that it’s not exactly a free market anywhere”.",
            "He said many electricity markets are “heavily distorted and dysfunctional” because of selective subsidies. “These market imbalances make investing in nuclear power very unfavourable in many countries,” he said.",
            "According to Mr Magwood, business models for utilities have changed and selling electricity is generating little profit, or even a loss, in many countries.",
            "“A situation has been created where a mechanism, which had been so successful for so many years, where revenue is generated through the sale of electricity to enable investment into future plants and equipment, is breaking down. That’s not a sustainable situation.”",
            "Utilities today, for example, are expecting nuclear equipment vendors to come up with ready designs for plants, but are unwilling or unable to pay for this element of new-build projects. At the same time, Mr Magwood said, vendors often do not have the financial resources to cover the cost of getting a design ready for deployment.",
            "Mr Magwood said there are some policy approaches, including the regulated asset-base (RAB) model being considered in the UK, that could be more favourable to large capital projects and be an incentive to nuclear. Large wind farms have large capital costs and could also benefit from “reforms to the market”. ",
            "“On the other hand, the nuclear sector needs to evolve to reflect the market,” he said. The market is not going to change overnight. It’s going to take a long time for it to be reformed.",
            "“It would be to the nuclear sector’s advantage to have products that fit the budgets of current customers under current circumstance.”",
            "And so we come back to SMRs and to microreactors that can be built quicker and more easily than the large LWRs.  ",
            "“And I think that’s one of the things that’s really driving this interest in small reactors – the idea that instead of investing in 2,000 MW you can build 300 MW now and add another 300 MW when it’s needed, until you get to the 2,000 you’re looking for,” Mr Magwood said.",
            "“And that way, every time you install a 300-MW system and put it on the grid, you are making money back and starting to recover your costs, while you start constructing the next module. ",
            "“I mean, that's a model that is very attractive to a lot of people. And I think that’s something that the nuclear sector is going to have to do if it's going to survive over the next decade or so.”"

            "Companies including Russia’s Rosatom and NuScale of the US told the inquiry that Generation IV small modular reactor technology could be a perfect fit for Australia because they provide the reliable, load-following power needed to address the intermittency of renewables.",
            "“Nuclear energy should be on the table for consideration as part of our future energy mix,” committee chairman Ted O'Brien said. “Australia should say a definite ‘No’ to old nuclear technologies but a conditional ‘Yes’ to new and emerging technologies such as small modular reactors. And most importantly, the Australian people should be at the centre of any approval process.",
            "“If we’re serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we can’t simply ignore this zero-emissions baseload technology. But we also need to be humble enough to learn lessons from other countries who have gone down this path. It’s as much about getting the technology right as it is about maintaining a social licence based on trust and transparency.”"

            "The new uranium reserve, for which $150m has been allocated, will provide assurance of availability of uranium in the event of a market disruption and support strategic US fuel cycle capabilities. ",
            "During the first year, it is expected that the reserve would directly support the operation of at least two US uranium mines and the reestablishment of domestic conversion capabilities. ",
            "“Establishing this reserve is a critical step needed to address the overreliance on imported uranium product that has undermined US energy security and impacted US fuel supply capabilities,” the report concludes.",
            "Uranium is required for 96 commercial nuclear reactors providing about 20% of electricity generation in addition to fueling navy aircraft carriers and submarines. The domestic industry is no longer producing uranium, with 100% of requirements are coming from imports or dwindling inventory.",
            "The report calls for “streamlining regulatory reform and land access for uranium extraction” and support for Department of Commerce efforts to protect against future uranium dumping by Russia in the US market. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission should have the power to deny imports of nuclear fuel fabricated in Russia or China.",
            "It proposes “a level playing field” for all energy sources in power markets and says the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) should improve competition in wholesale energy markets. ",
            "The civilian nuclear energy industry has long argued that nuclear energy’s contribution to energy security and grid stability should be rewarded. In 2018 the Nuclear Energy Institute said a decision by FERC not to adopt a proposal that would have required markets to compensate “fuel-secure” baseload electricity generation was a “missed opportunity” to support nuclear plants. The NEI says nuclear’s attributes, including resiliency and reliability, are not being fairly valued in the market.",
            "NEI president and chief executive officer Maria Korsnick said. “The status quo, in which markets recognise only short-term price signals and ignore the essential role of nuclear generation, will lead to more premature shutdowns of well-run nuclear facilities. Once closed, these facilities are shuttered forever.”",
            "Six commercial nuclear plants have shut down in the US since 2013 and 12 more are scheduled to retire within seven years.",

            "Mr Trump set up the working group in July 2019 after saying he did not agree with a US Commerce Department investigation that found uranium imports threaten US national security.",
            "Mr Trump said he would not impose quotas on uranium imports buy agreed the department’s findings raised significant concerns and ordered the establishment of the working group to carry out a deeper review.",
            "The potential for quotas on foreign uranium stemmed from an investigation into whether imported uranium ore and related products, which are essential components for the US’s nuclear arsenal, submarines, aircraft carriers and nuclear power plants, were a security threat.",
            "Unveiling the working group report on 23 April energy secretary Dan Brouillette said, however, that the decline of the US industrial base in the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle over the past few decades “had threatened national interest and national security”.",
            "He said the report lays out an array of policy options to restore US leadership in nuclear energy and technology. “As a matter of national security, it is critical that we take bold steps to preserve and grow the entire US nuclear energy enterprise,” he said. “The Trump administration is committed to regaining our competitive global position as the world leader in nuclear energy.”",
            "The report says the US must use technological innovation and advanced nuclear R&D investments to consolidate technical advances and strengthen leadership in the next generation of nuclear energy technologies.",
            "Policy proposals will ensure there will be a healthy and growing nuclear energy sector to which uranium miners, fuel cycle providers, and reactor vendors can sell their products and services. ",
            "The report also says the government needs to support the US nuclear energy industry in exporting civil nuclear technology in competition with state-owned enterprises.",
            "The US has two future defence needs for domestic uranium supply: low-enriched uranium needed to produce tritium for nuclear weapons in the 2040s, and highly-enriched uranium needed to fuel navy nuclear reactors in the 2050s.",
            "The strategy also recognises that US national security is integrated with the health of the front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle and the US therefore needs a strong civil nuclear industry to enable national defence.",
            "The DOE warns in the report that “a 10-year timeline reflects a responsible approach to addressing the challenges facing the front-end of the fuel cycle”."

            "Opposing a nuclear project that is more than 1,000 kilometres away from Vienna seems like a misplaced effort, but is driven by concerns much closer to home – that its neighbour, the Czech Republic, may build a nuclear power plant on the border. Austria lost the Hinkley Point fight but can be expected to continue its opposition to new nuclear in the EU.",
            "Austria’s neighbour, Germany, was once a leader in nuclear power generation, but its knee-jerk reaction to the Fukushima-Daiichi accident has prompted a wave of plant shutdowns. Whilst it has endeavoured to increase renewable energy production as a replacement for nuclear, a far better approach would have been to add renewables as a supplement to its existing nuclear fleet. This hybrid approach would have nearly doubled the amount of carbon-free generation that Germany achieved in 2019. ",
            "Closing Germany’s nuclear fleet, which ironically was among the safest and best-run in the world, was a waste of a valuable European resource, and has set the country a decade behind where it could have been in its fight against climate change.",
            "Now officially outside the EU, the UK has taken a much more thoughtful approach to nuclear power. It is committed to increasing its nuclear generation – with about one fifth of UK power currently generated by nuclear plants. Why has the UK taken such a different stance to that of its EU neighbours like Germany? It comes down to natural resources and a hard look at the facts. ",
            "In the UK, we set ourselves ambitious carbon emission targets, but solar and wind can only take us so far. One need only live through a London winter to realise the futility of solar as an option, and even offshore wind in the UK has a median capacity factor of only around 36%. That means that, if you want 1,000 MW of power delivered to the grid, you have to install over 2,700 MW of windmills. That also means an awful lot of windmills cluttering up pristine coastlines and countryside.  The UK’s energy industry must wake up to the fact that we cannot rely on these renewal energy streams in the same way that other countries can. When it comes to nuclear power, we must think bigger. And smaller.",
            "The only active “big” nuclear new-build project in the UK is Hinkley Point C, with NuGen project at Moorside in Cumbria and the Horizon project at Wylfa in north Wales on ice. If the government’s regulated asset base model gets implemented for nuclear, the cost of capital for those big projects will be greatly reduced. However, we are seeing steps in the right direction, with the likes of specialist engineers Rolls-Royce developing small modular reactor (SMR) technology and the development of Moltex Energy’s stable salt reactor. ",
            "Looking further afield, the divide continues on the world stage. In the US, more readily accessible cheap natural gas and an anti-renewables president mean that nuclear generation is not a priority. As Donald Trump seeks to boost the coal and oil industries and rolls back climate protections, nuclear power has been all but lost in the melee, with smaller single-unit sites shutting shown under economic pressure from low-cost gas generation. ",
            "Meanwhile, to the East, both China and Russia are taking huge strides to further expand their nuclear capabilities, with both countries enhancing their international clout through their nuclear programmes. ",
            "China, facing huge demand for electricity and limited resources for power generation, is betting big on its huge nuclear programme to meet both energy needs and climate targets. This strategy has paid dividends as, while constructing its fleet of 48 nuclear power plants and 10 more under construction, China has developed skills and technology that are valuable exports. Expect to see China as a major supplier of nuclear power plants throughout the world in the upcoming decade. ",
            "Likewise, Russia, which has vast nuclear power expertise, is expanding its new build-projects beyond its borders into Turkey and, possibly, eastern Europe, where there is already an existing population of Russian-supplied nuclear reactors. ",
            "Yet, looking at Asia as a whole, Japan and South Korea are slowing their development of new nuclear plants, while Indonesia has long discussed developing a plant but has made very little progress. ",
            "Clearly, the world’s division on nuclear isn’t as simple as East vs West. There are bigger and more complex forces at play. ",
            "So, if there is such a divergence in attitudes to nuclear power, are there any areas where sentiment is consistent? ",
            "Readers will be aware of the potential for SMRs to revolutionise nuclear power generation – reducing build time, risk and costs. The initial capital cost of a smaller reactor, capable of being built in a factory, results in returns in as little as 18 months, compared to the eight or nine years required to build a large 1,600 MW reactor like each EPR at Hinkley Point C.  It is far more difficult for the government to find the “patient capital” willing to invest in that timeframe. For those looking to be at the heart of nuclear’s future, many believe that smaller is better when it comes to nuclear. ",
            "While manufacturing questions surrounding SMRs prevail, specialist UK engineering firms are pretty much poised to get SMRs up-and-running, with existing supply chains ready for when the necessary government seed funding materialises. ",
            "Should the UK leverage these existing assets, skill sets and supply chains, we could see the country really get ahead in the global nuclear race, which would also be a major win for the environment.",

            "In December 201 the US Department of Energy granted a site use permit to Oklo to build a demonstration Aurora energy plant on the Idaho National Laboratory site.",
            "The Aurora will generate both usable heat and electricity, run for at least 20 years on one load of fuel and operate without the need for water. The plant can also recycle fuel and ultimately convert nuclear waste to clean energy.",
            "Oklo, which is solely venture-funded and backed primarily by US-based investors, announced last year that it had successfully demonstrated prototypes of a metallic fuel at INL for the Aurora reactor. It said it had fabricated prototypes with multiple fuel elements reaching production specification.",
            "Oklo would use high-assay low-enriched uranium (Haleu) fuel. However, in common with many other advanced reactor developers, the lack of reliable access to Haleu remains a challenge – one that Congress has set its sights on addressing. The sooner Oklo can “have access to be able to work with that, the faster we’re going to be able to actually get something built,” company co-founder Jacob DeWitte said.",
            "Haleu fuel has many advantages that improve reactor performance. Because the fissionable isotope U235 is more concentrated in Haleu fuel, the fuel assemblies and reactors can be smaller, which is one reason why many small modular reactor designs will run on Haleu. The reactors do not need to be refuelled as often, and they can achieve higher burnup rates, which means less fuel will be required and less waste will be produced."

            "Haleu fuel has many advantages that improve reactor performance. Because the fissionable isotope U235 is more concentrated in Haleu fuel, the fuel assemblies and reactors can be smaller, which is one reason why many small modular reactor designs will run on Haleu. ",
            "The reactors do not need to be refuelled as often, and they can achieve higher burnup rates, which means less fuel will be required and less waste will be produced.",
            "Haleu is a component for advanced nuclear reactor fuel that is not commercially available today and may be required for a number of advanced reactor designs under development in both the commercial and government sectors.",
            "Several US companies, including Oklo, are developing micro-reactor technologies that would use this fuel, the INL said ",
            "INL said Oklo applied for access to the Haleu material through a competitive process INL launched earlier this year.",
            "INL will produce Haleu by processing and treating used fuel from the now-decommissioned Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR II), containing high concentrations of uranium.",
            "In December 2019, the US Department of Energy granted a site use permit to Oklo to build a demonstration Aurora energy plant – comprising a small 1.5-MW reactor with integrated solar panels – on the Idaho National Laboratory site."

            "Several Generation IV reactor types are under consideration and projects are in various phases of market readiness. Some are closer to being realised than others, with the most optimistic estimate for commercial deployment being the early 2030s.",
            "Generation IV reactors have the advantage of fitting the low-carbon requirement for future energy technologies, but will need to do more than this to be viable. They will need to compete economically with renewables and show guaranteed cost savings. The next bit step is the construction of a working prototype, which would give developers a reactor model they could sell to customers. As yet, no one has got that far.",
            "China",
            "China produced a working prototype of an HTGR, but hasn’t put multiple units of the 250 MW design into commercial electricity generation service. The plant’s developer, China’s State Nuclear Power Technology Corp (SNPTC), says the reactor’s heat output is suitable for use in steel making and hydrogen production. ",
            "However, Mark Hibbs, a senior fellow at Carnegie’s Nuclear Policy Programme, says SNPTC dropped plans to manufacture 20 of the units for use in electricity generation when levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) estimates rose to levels higher than a conventional PWR such as China’s indigenous Hualong One. ",

The CFR-600, which was designed and developed by the China Institute of Atomic Energy with Russian assistance, will be a demonstration sodium-cooled pool-type fast reactor and is expected to begin commercial operation by 2023. China’s R&D on fast neutron reactors started in 1964, supported by Russia. ",
            "The development of a commercial-scale reactor, the 1,000-1,200 MW CFR-1000 reactor, is said to be under review. A final investment decision is due this year with construction starting in December 2028 and operations scheduled for 2034. Fast neutron reactors are seen as the main reactor technology for China and CNNC has said the FNR could become predominant by mid-century.",

However, in 2018, the US government issued a ban on nuclear energy exports to China, which brought the TerraPower-China cooperation to an abrupt halt. ",
            "Russia",

The Brest plant is part of Russia’s Breakthrough project for the development of closed fuel cycle technology. The start date for construction has been postponed several times because of the need for additional testing of key reactor structural elements. ",

            "One revenue model that holds promise for developers of small modular reactors (defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency as units with electrical power ratings of less than 300MW) is to offer heat as the primary output of their plants. Heat can be used to generate electricity, but it can also be used for process heat for industry, especially for manufacturing chemicals, the production of hydrogen, and desalinisation. The combination of revenues from these heat streams could expand the business case for advanced reactors. ",
            "US think-tank Third Way says companies investing in Generation IV technologies are being built and funded because the innovators and investors see profit in creating an answer to the global energy paradox – there are 1.3 billion people in the world without access to reliable electricity. “Advanced nuclear can provide that electricity while cutting global carbon emissions,” the think-tank said.",
            "Generation IV reactors offer the promise of improved safety, efficiency, and lower costs. A 2017 study by Energy Innovation Reform Project put the average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) at $60/MWh, or 39% lower than the $99/MWh expected by the US Energy Information Agency for pressurised-water reactor nuclear plants entering service in the early 2020s. The LCOE is the long-term price at which the electricity produced by a nuclear plant will have to be sold at for the investor to cover all their costs including a profit. ",
            "There are other advantages that could be unlocked by the development of Generation IV plants. Up-front capital is less than for conventional reactors and lead times are shorter. The proliferation risk is lower because used nuclear fuel can be used. Some models offer the possibility of burning actinides to further reduce waste and of being able to \"breed more fuel\" than they consume. Many can be factory-manufactured and transported to isolated, energy-hungry areas on the back of vehicles.",
            "The problem remains that Generation IV plants still require substantial R&D effort, preventing their commercial adoption in the short term.",
            "",
            "In the US and Canada more than 50 companies representing more than $1bn in investor money, are pursuing technical innovations in nuclear energy. They include big-name projects like TerraPower and small startups including California-based Oklo, which recently received a site use permit to build a demonstration Aurora energy plant (pictured) – comprising a small reactor with integrated solar panels – on the Idaho National Laboratory site.",
            "There are significant differences in the timelines and prospects for success between developers of SMRs, depending on the type of technology they are pursuing. Plants based on established light-water reactor technologies, which have been in use since the 1950s, are inevitably closer to fruition than plants based on fast neutron reactors that do not use water as a moderator or coolant. ",
            "Potential new coolants for Generation IV plants include liquid metal, high temperature gases, and molten salt. Third Way says nuclear reactors using these coolants can be even safer than most light-water reactors. The higher operating temperatures of coolants like helium, liquid metals, and molten salts more readily lend themselves to industrial applications requiring high temperature process heat – exactly the kind of applications that would add value to the business model.",
            "Another major focus is developing thorium-based, molten-salt reactors – which scientists also hope can help meet the world’s growing need for energy without contributing to global warming.",
            "These reactors are powered by controlled fission reactions in the same way as conventional uranium reactors. However, the technology could prove to be cheaper and cleaner, while the use of thorium – which is less radioactive than uranium – may generate less waste.  ",
            "India has a three-stage programme to develop thorium fueled reactors. The country plans to use advanced heavy-water reactors fueled with U-233 obtained from the irradiation of thorium in PHWRs and fast reactors.",
            "Replacing water as a coolant with liquid molten salt could tap more of the energy available in radioactive materials and reduce the risk of a meltdown by slowing the nuclear reactions automatically if they get too hot.",
            "The South China Morning Post reported that Xu Hongjie, director of China’s molten-salt programme, said China had mastered the technology in laboratories and planned to put it into commercial use by 2030 – before anyone else did so. The newspaper said China has invested about 2 billion yuan ($300m) over the past few years in molten salt research and development, but building the plants will require tens of billions more.",
            "A first objective for China is reported to be the design and development of a first-of-a-kind 100 MW thorium molten salt reactor in 2020 in the city of Wuwei in Gansu province. Commercial development is targeted for the early 2030s. ",
            "Another aspect of the R&D effort is that developers need places to test their technologies, develop materials, and new types of reactor fuel. Public-private partnerships with government agencies, labs, private companies, and non-profit R&D centres are vital.",
            "A number of public-private partnerships have made progress. NuScale’s cost-sharing agreement with the DOE covers design and licensing work for its 60-MW SMR.  TerraPower has a $60m grant from the DOE for its work with Southern, a nuclear utility, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory on its molten chloride salt reactor. Southern and other partners, such as the Electric Power Research Institute, add their resources, including funds and expertise, to the effort.",
            "The most significant international endeavor to make progress with Generation IV technology is the Generation IV International Forum (GIF), a cooperative effort set up by nine founding-member countries (it now has 14 member countries) in 2000 to carry out the R&D needed to establish the feasibility and performance capabilities of Generation IV nuclear energy systems. The forum aims to pool resources, allowing scientists to develop safer and cheaper next-generation systems. It wants to commercially deploy Generation IV systems by 2040. ",
            "The six technologies undergoing R&D are the gas-cooled fast reactor, lead-cooled fast reactor, molten salt reactor (MSR), supercritical water-cooled reactor, sodium-cooled fast reactor (SCFR) and very high-temperature reactor (VHTR).",
            "Of the six, three have attracted most attention from entrepreneurial developers: the MSR, SCFR, VHTR designs. US national labs have rated these three designs as having the greatest likelihood of success in the next decade. Yet the challenges they face are enormous. ",
            "No one has ever built a commercial scale unit for any of these designs and put the unit into revenue service for a nuclear utility. The capital and operational costs to build and operate a first-of-a-kind (FOAK) unit are still in a process of discovery. The forum itself has acknowledged that for real long-term progress to be made in Generation IV development, advanced research facilities need to be built, the industry must become more involved and the “workforce of the future” should be developed.",
            "Regulation is another obstacle. Regulatory agencies have never assessed Generation IV reactors and the preparations for doing so are costly and time-consuming. Plans by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to cooperate to speed up design reviews are a step in the right direction. Two companies – Terrestrial Energy, a developer of an MSR, and NuScale, which is developing an SMR based on LWR design principles – have so far signed up for the design review process.",
            "The two biggest challenges remain getting through the licensing process and convincing a nuclear utility, based on real experience with prototypes, that an advanced design can be built on time, within budget, and operated at a profit. ",
            "For this to happen, a business model that includes heat output could be crucial.",
            "What Next For Generation IV?",
            "The nuclear industry sees a number of key steps governments can take to speed up Generation IV deployment. Some governments – notably the US and China – are already making commitments of this sort.",

To meet its climate goal as stipulated in the Paris agreement, China will need to reduce its coal power capacity by 40% over the next decade, according to Global Energy Monitor’s analysis. At present, this seems unrealistic. In addition to roughly 1,000 GW of existing coal capacity, China has 121 GW of coal plants under construction, which is more than is being built in the rest of the world combined.",
            "China has 48 nuclear power reactors in operation, 10 under construction, and more about to start construction. Almost all of the new starts are at coastal sites due to limitations on getting large components transported inland. It is aiming for 58 GW of installed nuclear capacity by 2020 – up from about 36 GW today.",

China continues to buy nuclear reactors from Russia and in December signed a deal that could lead to the construction of two advanced heavy water reactors from Canada’s Candu Energy Inc. The contract was awarded by China National Nuclear Power Co Ltd (CNNP) for pre-project work. CNNP is planning the construction of two AHWRs in China in or around 2021. ",
            "China is making significant investments in nuclear energy R&D, especially for molten salt, high temperature gas, and even thorium-fuelled reactors.

The government has an ambitious objective to reach 63 GW of installed nuclear power capacity by 2032, a large increase compared to today’s installed capacity of around 7 GW in 2019. One of India’s most pressing problems is that it relies relies on coal for about 48% of its energy generation.",

This domestic plant, two of which are under construction at Kakrapar, is based on Canada’s Candu technology.

The government must also come to terms with how it will replace lost nuclear capacity, which accounts for about 24% of generation.",
            "South Korea has four APR1400 plants under construction at Barakah in the United Arab Emirates. The Seoul government sees nuclear technology exports as a way of reviving the domestic nuclear industry. It recently signed an updated agreement with the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy in Saudi Arabia to create a joint venture for the construction of a low-power small modular nuclear reactor in the Middle East kingdom.",
            "The SMR technology being planned for Saudi Arabia is the Korea Atomic Research Institute’s “system-integrated modular advanced reactor” (Smart), a medium-sized unit designed for generating electricity and for thermal applications such as seawater desalination. Scientists in South Korea have been developing the technology for 22 years.",
            "In another move aimed at the export market, South Korea completed the US regulator’s safety design review of its APR1400, the same type of plant under construction at Barakah. Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Company (KHNP) and its parent company Korea Electric Power Corporation submitted the application in December 2014.",
            "In Japan, the main theme in the coming years is likely to be more frustration over the slow pace of reactor restarts.",
            "Japan has 62 nuclear power units, but shut down all 42 that were operating at the time after the Fukushima-Daiichi accident. This has led to increased imports of coal and natural gas to keep the lights on. The cost of these imports is a strain on the nation’s economy. Thirty-three units have a licence to operate although before units return to service they need to meet stricter safety standards introduced following the accident.",
            "Nine units have returned to service. They are Genkai-3 and -4, Ikata-3, Ohi-3 and -4, Sendai-1 and -2, and Takahama-3 and -4.",
            "Restarts have taken so much time partly because the Nuclear Regulatory Agency has leaned hard on Japan’s nuclear utilities over anti-terrorism requirements and measures to mitigate the effects of volcanic eruptions.",
            "Challenges to restarts have also come from provincial politicians who have found success in getting elected by criticising the nuclear energy industry. The closure of the reactors, and the long, uncertain process to restart them, has hit local economies that depended on the payroll from plant employment and the economic multiplier effect of plant purchases of parts and supplies.",
            "Japan’s exports of nuclear reactors have dried up with both Hitachi and Mitsubishi withdrawing from planned deals in the UK due to higher than expected costs and uncertainties over customer financing. ",
            "Japan does not have any significant technology developed, beyond R&D lab scale projects, for either small modular reactors or high temperature gas reactors. ",
            "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the country’s nuclear share in 2018 was about 6.2%. Before Fukushima, Japan generated about 30% of its electricity from nuclear and planned to increase that to 40%.",
            "An energy white paper adopted by the Cabinet called for further efforts to cut carbon emissions by keeping to a nuclear generation target of 20% to 22%.",
            "There has been some potentially positive news from Japan. In August 2019, four of Japan’s major energy and nuclear power companies signed an agreement to discuss potential collaboration on boiling water reactor projects – a move that could lead to construction of a new nuclear power plant at Higashidori in the north of the country.",
            "Tokyo Electric Power Company, Chubu Electric Power Company, Hitachi and Toshiba said the agreement was signed with the aim of creating “sustainable business operations” for the safe and economical operation of the BWR business, and constructing and operating nuclear power plants.",
            "The Tokyo-based Japan Atomic Industrial Forum said given that no BWRs have yet been restarted following the March 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi accident, maintaining the technology and human resources for the reactors is a major issue.",
            "In Southeast Asia, the International Energy Agency says nuclear could provide around 2% of the share of power generation by 2040. Nuclear power does not feature in Southeast Asia’s energy mix, although according to the IEA a number of countries are considering it as an option.",
            "Thailand includes 2 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2036 in its national power development plan. Vietnam also makes provision for its introduction by 2030 in its power development plan, although the plan has been suspended. Malaysia and Indonesia\r\nrecognise nuclear power as an energy option in their national plans, but there is no specific plan to introduce it.",
            "The Philippines\r\nhas a nuclear station at Bataan, north of Manila, but it has never operated and has been mothballed. The country does, however, seem to be making more progress than its neighbours with regards to new build. Congress has approved legislation that calls for a regulatory framework to be established with a view to using nuclear for energy production, health and medicine, scientific research, education and agriculture. In October energy secretary Alfonso Cusi said the government will prepare a detailed plan for the IAEA on how it could embark on a nuclear power programme.",

            "The Candu nuclear plant is a pressurised heavy-water reactor design developed in the late 1950s and 1960s by a partnership that included Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario and Canadian General Electric. The acronym used for its name derives from “Canada Deuterium Uranium”. It refers to its deuterium oxide (heavy water) moderator and its use of natural uranium fuel, which is not enriched with U-235."

            "According to The Times newspaper EDF has hired Rothschild as financial adviser for the project and says it wants a “definitive way forward” from the government this year so it can start construction in 2022.",
            "The problem is the nature of the financing. The government says it wants to support new nuclear projects, but only if they can be delivered at a competitive price and each individual project represents value for money. The problem with new build is the amount of capital needed up-front and the long wait for any return on investment while the project is completed and becomes revenue-generating.",
            "The government is working on a new financing model, the regulated asset-based, or RAB model, which it says will provide regulated returns to investors and reduce the cost of raising private finance. According to government documents the RAB model will reduce consumer bills and maximise value for money for consumers and taxpayers.",
            "The RAB model, typically used for funding UK monopoly infrastructure, involves an economic regulator who grants a licence to a company to charge a regulated price to users of the infrastructure. It essentially aims to lower overall costs by having consumers fund future nuclear projects before they are built.",
            "If the RAB model is implemented in the UK – and the government has not yet made a decision – it could be adapted for use by other market economies. It could be instrumental in reviving the prospects for the Moorside, Wylfa, Newydd, and Oldbury nuclear projects, all of which have stalled because of a lack of financing.",

Both projects have seen significant delays and cost overruns. The startup date for Hanhikivi-1, a Russian-supplied plant also under construction in Finland, has been pushed back to 2028, four years behind the original schedule and eight years later than the proposed start when the government approved the project in 2010.",
            "The French government has asked EDF to work on a project for the construction of six new next-generation EPR 2 units, the successor to the EPR.",
            "Recently, however, a government minister said no decision will be taken before the end of 2022, pushing it beyond the date of the country’s next general election.",
            "The French nuclear industry has said that to realistically replace retiring nuclear capacity in the 2040s and secure a balanced mix based on nuclear and renewable energies, it needs a decision by the French government about a programme of new units by 2021-2022.",
            "In Germany, Belgium, Spain\r\nand Switzerland the sector is dominated by plans to phase out nuclear. Germany plans to shut its plants by 2022, Belgium by 2025 and Spain some time after 2025.

            "The committee makes three key recommendations. Firstly, the government should consider the prospect of nuclear technology as part of Australia’s future energy mix. ",
            "Secondly, the government should undertake a body of work to deepen the understanding of nuclear technology in the Australian context. This should involve a technology assessment on different generations of nuclear reactors including an examination of their feasibility and suitability to Australia. ",

            "The Aurora will generate both usable heat and electricity, run for at least 20 years on one load of fuel and operate without the need for water, he said. The plant can also recycle fuel and ultimately convert nuclear waste to clean energy.",
            "Oklo, which is solely venture-funded and backed primarily by US-based investors, recently announced that it successfully demonstrated prototypes of a metallic fuel at INL for the Aurora reactor. It said it had fabricated prototypes with multiple fuel elements reaching production specification.",

However, I common with many other advanced reactor developers, the lack of reliable access to Haleu remains a challenge – one that Congress has set its sights on addressing. The sooner Oklo can “have access to be able to work with that, the faster we’re going to be able to actually get something built,” Mr DeWitte said.",
            "Haleu fuel has many advantages that improve reactor performance.  Because the fissionable isotope U235 is more concentrated in Haleu fuel, the fuel assemblies and reactors can be smaller, which is one reason why many small modular reactor designs will run on Haleu.  The reactors do not need to be refueled as often, and they can achieve higher burnup rates, which means less fuel will be required and less waste will be produced.",

            "In its manifesto, published last week, the Labour Party promised to build new nuclear power plants needed for energy security and revive the Wylfa Newydd project in Anglesey, north Wales.“The Tories have let down the people of Ynys Môn (Anglesey) by failing to deliver the Wylfa project,” the manifesto said. “Labour will work with people on the island to maximise its potential for new nuclear energy, alongside investment in renewables.”Hitachi announced in January that it would suspend work on plans to build two UK Advanced Boiling Water Reactors (ABWRs) at Wylfa Newydd because of rising construction costs and failure to reach an agreement on financing with the UK government.Press reports in August said prime minister Boris Johnson was preparing to announce government plans to build small modular reactors in the northern English counties of Yorkshire, Cumbria, Lancashire and Cheshire in a £500m scheme.Mr Johnson has made no such announcement yet, but earlier this month a consortium headed by British engineering giant Rolls Royce said it expects to develop its first-of-a-kind SMRs at existing licensed nuclear sites – with Cumbria and Wales its top targets.The UK’s fleet of 15 commercial nuclear plants provides about 17.7% of the country’s electricity, but according to the International Atomic Energy Agency the reactor fleet is comparatively old and this inevitably gives rise to safety related ageing issues and the possibility of permanent shutdowns for decommissioning.The only commercial nuclear plants under construction in the UK are the two 1,600-MW EPR units at Hinkley Point C in southwest England.EDF and China General Nuclear have plans for an additional two EPRs at Sizewell. The two companies also intend to deploy HPR1000 technology at Bradwell.Horizon Nuclear Power, owned by Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy Ltd, had proposed to build two ABWRs at each of its sites in Wylfa and Oldbury. The Wylfa project is now on hold and there have been no official announcements regarding progress on Oldbury.NuGen, owned by Toshiba, was planning to build up to 3.8 GW of nuclear generation at the Moorside site near Sellafield. In November 2018 Toshiba announced it had decided to wind up NuGen because of its inability to find a buyer and the ongoing costs it was incurring."

            "“We expect developing markets will drive global nuclear growth, especially China, which has embarked on a major nuclear new-build program,” S&P said.",
            "State support is key because nuclear generation is increasingly exposed to competitive and volatile energy markets, where renewables typically enjoy preferred treatment. ",
            "State support may come through capacity sales as in Russia, high nuclear capacity utilisation as in China, more supportive prices for the nuclear output as in Japan, contract for differences, or CO2 prices. ",
            "The UK delivers support through its contract for difference for two EPR units under construction at Hinkley Point C and through CO2 pricing mechanisms. France is considering re-regulating existing plants to justify life extension investments. The US provides zero-emission credits as a stimulus.",
            "However, nuclear will still be needed, S&P said. It said a combination of steady growth in renewables and maintenance of a material share of nuclear baseload over the next decades will help to achieve huge CO2 savings and smooth any energy transition. ",
            "Life extension costs for nuclear plants could still be cost-competitive, notably when considering additional grid costs for renewables. This is particularly true for Japan or eastern Europe where renewables are still more expensive than nuclear.",
            "Small modular reactors require lower upfront investments than traditional large nuclear blocks and could be manufactured serially, S&P said."

            "The BWRX-300, a 300-MW water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems, makes use of the design and licensing basis of GEH’s Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor, or ESBWR. Through significant design simplification, GEH believes the BWRX-300 will require up to 60% less capital cost per MW when compared to other water-cooled SMR designs or existing large nuclear reactor designs.

            "The success of these projects echoes the experience of nuclear power construction in decades past, when its rapid deployment largely decarbonised electricity production in countries like France and Sweden.",
            "Kirsty Gogan, co-founder and executive director of Energy for Humanity, told the conference at the agency’s Vienna headquarters that most new-build projects are delivering very low-cost, successful nuclear programmes, achieved through repeat builds, a programmatic approach, and building up skills and capabilities within the supply chain, labour force and project leadership team.",
            "The new builds that have gone over budget and schedule are all first-of-a-kind, first-in-a-generation projects,” Ms Gogan said. “There isn’t the experience within the project leadership teams, supply chain or labour force, and those designs are being licensed for the first time by regulators that haven’t really gained real life experience of licensing plants for a generation.”",
            "According to data compiled by the IAEA on the 61 new nuclear power reactors connected to the grid over the last decade, units in the Far East were built almost twice as quickly as those in Europe, taking on average 66 months versus 110 months. ",
            "Jessica Lovering, a former director of energy at the Breakthrough Institute, a US-based non-profit organisation, said the key to bringing down construction costs and times is to achieve high learning rates by repeating projects using standardised designs. ",
            "“If you look at South Korea today, their costs and construction times have been coming down gradually, so they can get a plant built in three to four years,” Ms Lovering said. “For a plant that’s over a gigawatt, that is really fast in terms of adding electricity to the grid.”",
            "The industry needs to move away from being largely focused on massive one-off projects, she said. “We have to move from project to product,” Ms Lovering said, adding that the deployment of small, medium sized or modular reactors will shift the industry’s approach."

            "Duke Energy’s announcement that it intends to extend the life of its entire fleet of 11 nuclear power plants is a much-needed boost for an industry in the US that has been hit by financial pressures and competition from government-backed corporations in China and Russia.Ironically, the news came on the same day that Exelon Generation, the company that runs the single-unit Three Mile Island nuclear station, confirmed it would officially close the plant, citing a lack of state action in subsidising clean energy.",
            "The Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the nuclear industry in the US, welcomed Duke Energy’s decision and noted that almost all operating US nuclear power reactors have applied with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for an initial licence extension. ",
            "The NEI said it expects that other utilities will follow Duke Energy’s lead and pursue second licence extensions for their nuclear power plants to meet their own climate and other goals. ",
            "The US has the largest number of nuclear plants in the world – 99 in commercial operation providing 20% of its electricity generation – but its leadership in the industry is said by many in the sector to be declining as efforts to build a new generation of reactors have been plagued by problems, and ageing plants have been retired or closed in the face of economic, market, and financial pressures.",
            "The situation, exacerbated by competition in the overseas new-build sector from China and Russia, has seen the nuclear industry and its supporters call on the government to enact legislation that would support the continued operation of nuclear plants.\n\r\nThe industry has long argued that electricity markets should be reformed to recognise the ability of traditional baseload generation with onsite fuel supplies – including nuclear power plants – to provide grid resiliency during extreme events like hurricanes or extreme winter weather.\n\nA report by the Washington-based think-tank the Atlantic Council issued a stark warning, arguing that the US nuclear energy industry is facing a crisis that the Trump administration must immediately address.\n\r\nThe good news is that the Trump administration recognises the problem, supports nuclear energy, and sees new generation nuclear technology such as small modular reactors as a key part of its energy strategy.Six US nuclear plants have been shut down permanently since 2013 and 12 more are slated to retire over the next seven years. That means a total of 18 shutdowns that will remove more than 15.87 GW of generation from the grid, or around 15% of existing nuclear capacity.\n\r\nOnly two nuclear plants, the Vogtle-3 and -4 Westinghouse AP1000 units in Georgia, are under construction.\n\r\nThe NEI said the US electricity grid is enduring “unprecedented tumult and challenge” because of the loss of thousands and thousands of megawatts of carbon-free, fuel-secure generation that nuclear plants represent.\n\r\nClosing nuclear plants makes electricity prices go up and is putting emissions reduction targets hopelessly out of reach, NEI president and chief executive officer Maria Korsnick said.",
            "Ms Korsnick said of the Duke announcement that Duke Energy has made “the bold, far-sighted decision” to extend the lives of all its nuclear power plants, because like other electricity producers it recognises that it cannot reach its carbon emission reduction target without them.",
            "“As America’s largest source of carbon emissions-free power, keeping our nuclear plants operating is a critical factor in meeting climate and energy goals,” she said.",
            "In a statement the NEI said a growing consensus by scientists and voices within the environmental community agree that nuclear energy is essential for decarbonisation. “Duke Energy’s announcement is one of the many examples of how nuclear energy is an important driver to meeting climate goals.”\n\r\nThe Atlantic Council said the decline of the nuclear power industry in the US is “an important policy problem” that is not receiving the attention it deserves. ",
            "The report was made public in March 2018, in the same week that Ohio-based utility FirstEnergy announced plans to permanently shut down its three nuclear power stations – Davis-Besse, Perry and Beaver Valley – within the next three years without some kind of state or federal relief."

            "The UK government has announced it wants to prepare to support further new nuclear projects, but only if they can be delivered at a competitive price and each individual project represents value for money.",
            "The government plans were contained in a consultation document on a possible new funding model for new nuclear in the UK.",
            "In the document the government says that by providing regulated returns to investors, a regulated asset-based, or RAB model, can reduce the cost of raising private finance for new nuclear projects, which are notorious for their up-front capital requirements. According to the document the RAB model will reduce consumer bills and maximise value for money for consumers and taxpayers.",
            "The RAB model, typically used for funding UK monopoly infrastructure, involves an economic regulator who grants a licence to a company to charge a regulated price to users of the infrastructure. ",
            "The model essentially aims to lower overall costs by having consumers fund future nuclear projects before they are built.",
            "According to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), RAB-funded infrastructure has attracted significant investment from private sector capital over the last 20-30 years, with total value of RAB assets in 2018 of about £160bn.",
            "After months of rumours that the government might consider the RAB model, the BEIS has launched the consultation to seek views on it, including arrangements for risk sharing.",
            "In the consultation document the BEIS says any RAB model would need to come with guarantees including government protection for investors and consumers against “specific remote, low probability but high impact risk events”.",
            "Those “risk events” include cost overruns,  disruption to debt markets, risks for which insurance is not available and political risks.",
            "There would need to be a fair sharing of costs and risks between consumers and investors set out in an economic regulatory regime, an economic regulator to operate the regime and a route for funds to be raised from energy suppliers to support new nuclear projects.",
            "The document says the UK recently became the first major economy to legislate for a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, but reaching this target will require ambitious action to reduce emissions while keeping energy costs low and supplies secure.  ",
            "To meet increasing energy demand, whilst reducing emissions to low levels, there will need to be a substantial increase in low-carbon generation. The government committee on climate change estimates a four-fold increase may be needed. This at a time when seven out of eight of the UK’s existing nuclear power stations – important contributors to the country’s low-carbon generation – are due to come offline by 2030 as they reach the end of their operational lives.",
            "As the cost of renewable technologies such as offshore wind and solar continues to fall, it is becoming clear that they are likely to provide most of the UK’s low-carbon generating capacity in 2050. However, there will still be a crucial role for low-carbon “firm” – or always available – power. The committee on climate change says 38% firm low-carbon energy might be needed to meet net zero while maintaining security of supply and keeping costs low.",
            "The consultation document says nuclear, which today provides about 20% of the UK’s electricity, is a low-carbon option and the government “should be prepared to support further new nuclear projects in the years ahead, if they can be delivered at a competitive price and each individual project represents value for money”.",
            "The first step in driving down costs was the signing of an ambitious policy deal –known as the nuclear sector deal – with the nuclear industry which focuses on lowering the cost of new nuclear projects by 30% to ensure nuclear remains competitive with other technologies. ",
            "The nuclear industry – as part of the implementation of the nuclear sector deal – is leading work to establish how that 30% target can be achieved by 2030. ",
            "This will involve thinking about how, for example, innovative approaches to advanced manufacturing, construction and materials can reduce costs in a range of products and services across the nuclear industry, including for future nuclear technologies.",
            "The deal will also see the government provide up to £56m for R&D for advanced modular reactors and increase its support the development and deployment of small modular reactors and the innovative technologies that support them",
            "The new RAB funding model could be used for EDF Energy’s plans for a new EPR plant at Sizewell C in Suffolk, which was left in doubt after criticism of the “contracts for difference” model and costs surrounding the Hinkley Point C project in Somerset.",
            "“Few project developers have a balance sheet that can accommodate the £15-20bn cost of delivering a new nuclear project, and financial investors have been unwilling to invest during the construction phase given the long construction period and risk of cost increases and delays,” the consultation document says.",
            "RAB could also resurrect plans to build two UK Advanced Boiling Water Reactors at the Wylfa project in North Wales, which were shelved last year because of rising construction costs and a failure to reach an agreement on financing with the UK government.",
            "France’s state-backed EDF Energy has been a vocal champion for the proposed RAB model after the cost of its twin-EPR Hinkley Point C project in Somerset was heavily criticised for its cost to consumers.",
            "BEIS said using an RAB model for future projects was suitable as companies such as EDF would look to replicate the Hinkley Point design in future plants. EDF said its proposed Sizewell C plant would be a “near replica” and therefore “cheaper to construct and finance”."

            "The US Department of Energy, he said, is studying ways to bail out nuclear (and coal) facilities, including potentially by mandating grid operators to purchase power from them.",
            "Supporters say it’s a sensible move because the nation’s power grid cannot rely solely on natural gas, wind, and solar. Opponents of the nuclear industry say nuclear power that was once advertised as being “too cheap to meter” has become too costly for electric utilities to buy. ",
            "The US has the largest number of nuclear plants in the world – 99 in commercial operation providing 20% of its electricity generation – but its industry leadership is declining as efforts to build a new generation of reactors have been plagued by problems, and ageing plants have been retired or closed in the face of economic, market, and financial pressures.",
            "The situation, exacerbated by robust competition in the new-build sector from China and Russia, has seen the nuclear industry and its supporters call on the government to enact legislation that would support the continued operation of nuclear plants.",
            "But the main reason behind nuclear’s problems in the US, says Dr J. Winston Porter, a national energy and environmental consultant and former assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency, is a shale revolution that has produced a rapid supply of inexpensive and relatively clean natural gas. ",
            "“Because of this we are becoming increasingly dependent on it for most electricity production,” he said. “Consequently, we risk losing the energy diversity that has long served as a bulwark of the US energy system. ",
            "“The problem may be an eventual lack of robust competition. One can even ask, ‘What will be the cost of natural gas when it is our only major source of electric power?’”",
            "Mr Perry said bailing out nuclear power plants is as important to national security as keeping the military strong, and that the cost to Americans should not be an issue.",
            "“You cannot put a dollar figure on the cost to keep America free,” he told reporters at a press conference in Washington, when asked about the administration’s effort to extend the lives of the facilities. When asked about the cost of a potential bailout, he said he did not yet know.",
            "The nuclear industry has long argued that electricity markets should be reformed to recognise the ability of traditional baseload generation with onsite fuel supplies – including nuclear power plants – to provide grid resiliency during extreme events like hurricanes or extreme winter weather.",

            "The good news is that the Trump administration recognises the problem, supports nuclear energy, and sees new generation nuclear technology such as small modular reactors as a key part of its energy strategy.",
            "According to promoters of SMRs, these scaled-down reactors could solve the challenges faced by nuclear power. SMR developers promise lowered costs, decreased production of radioactive waste, reduction or elimination of the risk of severe accidents, and no contribution to nuclear proliferation. Dozens of companies – both in the US and the rest of the world – are developing their own SMR designs, and many have received funding from wealthy private investors and the DOE.",
            "The need for a new direction is evident. Six US nuclear plants have been shut down permanently since 2013 and 12 more are slated to retire over the next seven years. That means a total of 18 shutdowns that will remove more than 15.8 GW of generation from the grid, or 15% of existing nuclear capacity.",
            "Only two nuclear plants, the Vogtle-3 and -4 Westinghouse AP1000 units in Georgia, are under construction. Construction of the Summer-3 and -4 AP1000 plants in South Carolina was abandoned in August 2017 following analysis of schedule and cost data from Westinghouse and subcontractor Fluor Corporation. South Carolina Electric & Gas owned 55% of the project and state-owned utility Santee Cooper the remaining 45%.",
            "The Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the nuclear industry in the US, said the US electricity grid is enduring “unprecedented tumult and challenge” because of the loss of thousands and thousands of megawatts of carbon-free, fuel-secure generation that nuclear plants represent. Closing nuclear plants makes electricity prices go up and is putting emissions reduction targets hopelessly out of reach, NEI president and chief executive officer Maria Korsnick (pictured) said.",
            "The Atlantic Council said the decline of the nuclear power industry in the US is “an important policy problem” that is not receiving the attention it deserves. The report was made public in March 2018, in the same week that Ohio-based utility FirstEnergy announced plans to permanently shut down its three nuclear power stations – Davis-Besse, Perry and Beaver Valley – within the next three years without some kind of state or federal relief.",
            "To save financially-ailing nuclear plants, state legislatures in Illinois and New York last year approved subsidies to keep nuclear plants operating after utilities made appeals about protecting consumers and jobs. ",

In Minnesota, the state legislature is considering a bill that would help Xcel Energy, owner and operator of the Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear stations, plan for the high costs of maintaining old nuclear power plants. The proposed legislation would give utilities earlier notice about how much money they could recover for costly work, Minnesota Public Radio reported.",
            "The NEI confirmed that Mr Trump had ordered Mr Perry to “prepare immediate steps” to stop premature closures of “fuel-secure” nuclear and coal power plants and prevent further risks to national security and grid resilience.",
            "This reflects the administration’s focus on grid resilience, which began last September when Mr Perry directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to “take swift action” to address threats to the resiliency of the US electric grid.",
            "In another signal that momentum for change is gathering pace, a broad coalition of 75 former US statesmen, national security officials and industry leaders urged Mr Perry to take immediate action to prevent the closure of nuclear reactors.",

            "Nuclear power plants are among the most robust elements of US critical infrastructure, the letter said. They have up to two years’ worth of fuel on site, providing valuable fuel diversity and increasing the resilience of the electrical grid by eliminating the supply vulnerabilities that some other forms of energy supply face.",
            "Congress continues to demonstrate bipartisan support for nuclear energy, with the Senate passing an appropriations bill last week that provides $1.2bn for the DOE’s nuclear energy programmes. The overwhelming 86-5 vote on the spending package came just over two weeks after the House passed a similar bill that also saw strong funding for nuclear energy.",
            "And in what the NEI called “a demonstration of the Trump administration’s continued support for revitalising the commercial nuclear industry”, the DOE recently announced nearly $64m in funding for advanced nuclear energy technology projects to be carried out by DOE national laboratories, universities and private companies.",
            "In recent months, the DOE has provided almost $90m in funding for advanced nuclear R&D projects through several different mechanisms, the NEI said.",
            "Meanwhile, the age of the existing nuclear fleet is a problem for the present. That’s not because America’s nuclear reactors are falling apart –they are regularly inspected, and almost all of them have now gone through the process of renewing their original 40-year operating licences for 20 more years, said David McIntyre, a public affairs officer at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A few, including the Turkey Point nuclear station in Florida, have even put in for a second round of renewals that could give them the ability to operate for a total of 80 years.",
            "Instead, it is the cost of upkeep that is prohibitive. Components degrade and break down, especially components exposed to radiation on a daily basis. Maintenance and repair, upgrades and rejuvenation all take investment. ",
            "And right now, that means spending lots of money on power plants that are not especially profitable. "

            "The study, which analyses the potential benefits and challenges of mobile nuclear power plants with very small modular reactor technology, said a small nuclear reactor offers a transformative technology, delivering one to 10 MW or so of electrical power for years without refueling, in a size small enough to be transported by road and air. A micro-reactor would be fully autonomous, load-following, cooled passively by the environment and meltdown-proof, the study said. It noted that the resupply of liquid fuel and drinking water for troops in-theatre costs about four lives for every 100 convoys. Micro-reactors, usually of 10MW or less, are under development in the US by companies like NuScale and terrestrial Energy, and also by NASA for space exploration.They would need no refuelling for 10 years or more and could use a form of low-enriched uranium known as high-assay low-enriched uranium (Haleu), which is neither weapons-grade nor useful for radioactive dirty bombs. Micro-reactors are being designed to protect against severe natural phenomena and man-made physical and cyber security threats.The study concluded that micro-reactors can provide “a continuous high-density power source, without the need for fuel resupply or other external power source, to meet future force demands”.The Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute said in a recent report that the cost to generate electricity from the first micro reactor will be less than the same costs for diesel generators at between $0.14/kWh and $0.41/kWh.The NEI report said that as companies continue to produce micro reactors, future costs are estimated to fall to between $0.09/kWh and $0.33/kWh. The range of costs is due to variations in transport accessibility, site conditions, the technology, the ability to reduce future costs through lessons learned and whether ownership is private or public.A UK report said micro-reactors are a feasible option for the UK and have a potential market in the hundreds by 2030.The report, produced by Nuvia, WSP and Atomic Acquisitions, said there is great potential for development of micro-reactors between 2030 and 2035."

The objective is to verify whether a plant design meets Canadian nuclear regulatory requirements. The review will focus on identifying any issues that could become fundamental barriers in a licensing process for a possible new-build project in Canada. “We are designing the BWRX-300 small modular reactor to be cost competitive with gas and renewables,” said Jon Ball, executive vice-president of nuclear plant projects for GEH. “This review is an important step in the commercialisation of this breakthrough technology.” The BWRX-300 is a 300-MW SMR derived from GEH’s 1,520 MW Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) design. According to GEH, the BWRX-300 leverages the design and licensing basis of the ESBWR, which received design certification in the US in 2014. GEH said it had used “dramatic design simplification” to result in the BWRX-300 requiring up to 60% less capital cost per MW when compared to other water-cooled SMRs or existing large nuclear reactor designs. Compared with the ESBWR, the BWRX-300 would use 50% less concrete and steel on a per MW basis.The company said it believes that the BWRX-300 can become cost-competitive with power generation from combined cycle gas and renewables."

            "15 May (NucNet): Scotland-based energy services company Wood has been appointed by the UK government to lead the second phase of a nuclear research project that aims to demonstrate significant cost savings in the design, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power reactors.",
            "The $4.6m government contract will see experts from industry and academia collaborate on the digital project using virtual engineering and high-performance computing.The project, known as the digital reactor design programme, is part of a broader effort to put UK industry at the forefront of developing Generation IV and small modular reactors, which could play a key role in meeting the UK’s future energy needs. Wood said phase one of the project has proved the concept for a new and better way of designing and building nuclear power reactors. Phase two will demonstrate “improved efficiency, enable supply chain collaboration and ultimately deliver a cultural change across the industry”.Andrew Stephenson, the UK government’s minister for nuclear, said: “Using virtual engineering and computing technology to design and build the next generation of nuclear reactors will position the UK at the cutting-edge of low-carbon energy innovation.”He said making simulations in a virtual world allows designers to take virtual risks, reducing design times and demonstrating cost savings across the nuclear life cycle, from design through to decommissioning. This is key to achieving cost reduction targets that are part of the UK’s industrial strategy, he said.Other organisations involved in the project include EDF Energy, Rolls-Royce, the National Nuclear Laboratory, the University of Liverpool and the University of Sheffield."

He said maintaining, replacing and expanding Japan’s domestic nuclear power generation capacity is the way to improve the country’s energy security in the long run.  Japan shut down all 42 commercial nuclear reactors after the March 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi accident. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the country’s nuclear share in 2017 was about 3.6%. Before Fukushima, Japan generated about 30% of its electricity from nuclear and planned to increase that to 40%.Nine units in Japan’s reactor fleet are now in commercial operation. They are Ohi-3 and -4, Genkai-3 and -4, Sendai-1 and -2, Takahama-3 and -4, and Ikata-3."

            "13 May (NucNet): Depending on renewable energy alone is not a reliable option and nuclear is needed because it is emissions-free and offers “rock-solid, 24/7 reliability”, US energy secretary Rick Perry has said.",
            "In a speech at the EarthX conference in Dallas, Mr Perry said: “Now some people want us to take renewables... and rely on them alone. If we followed their advice our energy might be cleaner, but nowhere near as reliable.”He cited concerns over how renewables would perform if the sun doesn’t shine or the wind blow, and what might happen if a single natural disaster or serious cyberattack occurred.“Our lights could go out and stay out, impacting our entire way of life,” he said. “And imagine the costs to our economy and society of maintaining a grid that is completely reliant on intermittent energy.”Mr Perry said this danger can be averted by adding nuclear to the energy mix. From small modular reactors to advanced reactors and micro reactors, American-led innovation “can and will blaze a trail for a truly amazing nuclear energy revival”, Mr Perry said.The US nuclear energy industry has said the US needs significant investment and bold policy to maintain its position as a world leader in nuclear safety, technology, and operation.Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute president and chief executive officer Maria Korsnick said recently that the nuclear sector in the US is under stress because it has been taken for granted in “a perfect storm” created by very low natural gas prices, very low demand increases for electricity and subsidies for other types of generation.Ms Korsnick said shutting nuclear plants is a huge step backwards and they cannot be restarted when politicians and people change their minds. She said that because of the six nuclear plants that have retired since 2012, “it’s as if we’ve made no progress at all in adding clean energy”.Nuclear is resilient and needs recognition in the marketplace for its low emissions, Ms Korsnick said. Nuclear helps keep the grid resilient, especially during periods of intense cold weather."

            "23 Apr (NucNet): The Minerals Council of Australia has said the time has come to end the discriminatory treatment of nuclear energy by repealing the ban on new plants. ",
            "In a statement dated 18 April the council, which represents Australia’s exploration, mining and minerals processing industry, said it welcomed prime minister Scott Morrison’s comments that nuclear energy must pay its way in Australia, but acknowledged that the federal government is not considering removing the current ban on nuclear power. “Removing the ban would allow for Australians to have a serious conversation about a genuinely technology neutral approach towards the nation’s energy mix – delivering affordable, reliable and clean energy sources,” the statement said. “The removal of the prohibition on nuclear energy will also allow for investment proposals to be brought forward. There is an urgent need for Australia to consider all technologies on their merits.”The council said nuclear energy provides 11% of the world's electricity which is low-cost, zero-emission and available 24/7. “That is why new nuclear power stations are being built in China, the United Arab Emirates, Finland and the UK,” it said. “Latest generation nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors offer the potential to fully back up renewable energy sources.”Mr Morrison said on a Tasmanian radio station recently that he would be okay with receiving proposals from the nuclear energy industry.However, following a negative reaction from the opposition, the Liberal politician took to Twitter to explain that even though receiving recommendations related to non-conventional energy generation was “not ‘not’ on the agenda”, his government does not have any plans to change the laws regarding nuclear power.Australian Nuclear Association vice-president Rob Parker told Sydney radio station 2GB that Australia can have a clean, low-carbon, low-cost future using nuclear energy, but political parties are not addressing the issue because they see it as being too contentious.Mr Parker said Australia can address its environmental and economic needs with nuclear energy. He called on the government to “engage with the issue, engage with the people who know how to build nuclear plants and get on and do the proper investigation”."

            "The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission said the application, from Global First Power with support from Ontario Power Generation and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation, is to deploy a micro modular reactor (MMR) plant at Chalk River in Ontario.The companies confirmed their submission of the application, which is in response to an invitation issued in April 2018 by Canadian Nuclear Laboratories for the construction and operation of an SMR demonstration unit at a CNL-managed site. In February Global First Power’s proposal became the first to advance to the third stage of CNL’s four-step review process, meaning the GFP consortium could discuss land arrangements, project risk management, and contractual terms.In 2017, CNL set the ambitious goal of siting an SMR on a CNL-managed site by 2026. It received 19 expressions of interest from technology developers interested in building a prototype or demonstration reactor at a CNL site. In February Terrestrial Energy and Starcore Nuclear completed the pre-qualification stage of the same invitation process.The proposed GFP project includes a nuclear plant containing an MMR unit. The plant will provide approximately 15 MW (thermal) of process heat (up to 5 MW of electricity) to an adjacent plant where it will be converted to electrical power or heat for clients. The electrical power could also be supplied to the area grid. “The MMR technology is an economically competitive alternative to greenhouse gas emitting diesel power and heat generation, with a smaller environmental footprint,” GFP said.GFP said it hopes that the MMR system will replace diesel in remote mines and communities that do not have access to the electricity grid as well as provide broad benefits in addressing energy-related issues in the indigenous communities in the north."

            "29 Mar (NucNet): A wide-ranging bill introduced by a group of bipartisan US senators seeks to reestablish US leadership in nuclear energy, bringing together private and public sector innovators to develop next-generation advanced reactor concepts.",
            "The Nuclear Energy Leadership Act aims to “spur development of demonstration projects at the Department of Energy, which could become an important source of carbon-free electricity generation”, the senators said in a joint press release. To compete with state-owned or state-sponsored developers in “rival nations” – namely Russia and China – the bill encourages significant collaboration between the federal government, national laboratories, and private industry. One provision directs the DOE to establish specific goals and ultimately demonstrate advanced reactors with the private sector. The bill seeks to “define and establish” a domestic market for advanced nuclear reactors by extending term limits for federal power purchase agreements (PPAs) from the current 10 years to 40 years.“Initial capital costs for nuclear reactors are paid for over a period beyond 10 years, which means 10-year PPAs do not work for nuclear projects,” the senators said. The bill requires the DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy to develop a 10-year plan to support advanced nuclear R&D goals. “There has not been a cohesive long-term strategy for the direction of US nuclear science and engineering R&D policy across administrations,” it says.The bill sets out plans to boost the development of fast reactors. Fast reactors, which are being explored or constructed in Japan, France, India, Russia and China, allow a significant increase in the amount of energy obtained from natural, depleted and recycled uranium. The technology also enables plutonium to be used and recycled several times, and minor actinides to be recycled.Only a handful of mature fast reactor concepts have been demonstrated and only two such units are in full commercial operation. At the end of 2016, Russia began commercial operation of the Beloyarsk-4 BN-800 sodium-cooled fast neutron reactor and also operates the Beloyarsk-3 BN-600 fast neutron unit, which began commercial operation in 1981, at the same site. In China, the 20-MW CEFR reached full power for the first time in December 2014, but has not generally operated as a commercial unit.To help advance US-developed fast reactor technology, the bill directs the DOE to construct a fast reactor research facility.The bill pushes for rapid advancements in high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuels, which several small modular reactors under development require but for which no domestic production capability exists.

            "4 Mar (NucNet): UK engineering giant Rolls-Royce has confirmed it is reviewing options for its civil nuclear business.",
            "The company was responding to a report in The Sunday Times which said it has hired consultancy KPMG to find a buyer for its nuclear division, in a move which could result in a deal worth around £200m.Rolls-Royce did not confirm or deny the report, but told NucNet today that it is “conducting a review of options for its international civil nuclear business”.The division specialises in monitoring and control equipment for measuring the temperature and radiation levels from nuclear reactors.The proposed move is thought to be part of chief executive Warren East’s plans to re-focus the engineering giant on its core jet engine, power generation turbine, and defence interests.However, it also comes amidst growing uncertainty over the future of planned new reactors in the UK after a number of flagship projects were shelved.Earlier this year Hitachi announced it was suspending the Wylfa nuclear project in Wales and Toshiba said it was winding up NuGen, the company overseeing plans to build three Westinghouse AP1000 units at Moorside in northwest England.The Sunday Times suggested the proposed sale would not include Rolls-Royce’s work for the Hinkley Point C project. Last month Rolls-Royce signed a contract to provide diesel generators for backup power to Hinkley Point C.Reports also said the sale will not affect the company’s involvement in a consortium working on plans for a new generation of small modular reactors.In February the Financial Times reported that Rolls-Royce and its partners were asking the UK government for more than £200m in funding to develop a business that will build SMRs. The company was said to be seeking a sum “in the low hundreds of millions”.Rolls-Royce confirmed to the Financial Times that its consortium was “in discussions with UK government officials that we hope could result in a significant joint investment in our power plant design.” In July the Financial Times reported that Rolls-Royce was preparing to shut down its project to develop SMRs if the government does not make a long-term commitment to the technology, including financial support."

            "1 Mar (NucNet): Nuclear energy in the US is facing major challenges and without effective policy action the country will be on track to lose a substantial proportion of its capacity and see China become the leader in nuclear power generation technology, International Energy Agency executive director Fatih Birol has told the US Senate energy and natural resources committee. ",
            "Mr Birol told a hearing into prospects for global energy markets that nuclear should be seen as a key asset in the US. He said the US has been a leader in nuclear power generation technology for 60 years, alongside France, Japan and Russia. However, if US policies do not change China will become the new leader in nuclear power generation, he said. “China has rapidly developed nuclear power over the past two decades, increasing from just three operating reactors in 2000 to 46 at the end of last year. Nuclear capacity in China is set to overtake that of the US within 10 years.”Mr Birol said the US should make it a priority to safeguard its existing fleet and to extend plant lifetimes. But in large parts of the US lifetime extensions present a challenge because wholesale markets do not value the energy security and clean energy contribution of nuclear. He said nuclear still generates twice as much low-carbon electricity in the US as wind and solar combined. The baseload capacity of nuclear power plants plays a major role in maintaining electricity security. This is especially true in the northern regions of the US which experience spikes in electricity and gas demand during extreme cold spells like the recent polar vortex – times when solar production can be challenged. There is significant international appetite for innovative approaches to nuclear power, including small modular reactors. SMRs can offer significant benefits, such as factory fabrication, flexibility in where they can be deployed and lower upfront investment. This is yet another opportunity for American innovation to play a leading role, Mr Birol told the hearing.To safeguard the long-term contribution of nuclear, the US needs to continue to accelerate innovation in new nuclear technologies, including SMRs, Mr Birol said."

            "30 Jan (NucNet): Nuclear energy plays an important role in France’s energy strategy and plans to permanently shut down four to six reactor units by 2028 do not indicate that the government has a nuclear exit strategy, ecology minister François de Rugy said.",
            "Last week France’s government unveiled its energy strategy for the next 10 years, which includes four to six reactor closures by 2028. In November president Emmanuel Macron said France will shut down 14 commercial nuclear reactors by 2035 out of 58, all operated by state-controlled utility EDF, now in commercial operation.“It is not, I want to say it very clearly, a nuclear exit strategy but a rebalancing in which nuclear has its place,” Mr de Rugy said. “We consider that in the production of electricity in France, and probably in Europe and in the world, nuclear power can play a role since it presents a completely carbon-free production.” Mr de Rugy said the government is waiting for EDF’s proposals, due in 2021, before deciding on the construction of new EPR reactors in France. He said the decision would be based on cost, funding assessments and technical feasibility. The government wants to wait for the start of the Flamanville-3 EPR, the only one under construction in France.Faulty weldings discovered last year forced EDF to delay the start-up date for the 1,600-MW Generation III plant to the second quarter of 2020 and announce an increase in the cost of the project to €10.5bn and then to €10.9bn. An estimate of the cost in July 2011 was €8bn.Earlier this week the French nuclear industry signed a contract with the government and unions, covering the period 2019-2022, which proposes an action plan for the nuclear industry.Under the contract, Framatome will develop a new version of the EPR and will work with EDF and the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, or CEA, to develop a small modular reactor based on French technology.

            "8 Jan (NucNet): The US Department of Energy has issued a notice of intent to invest in a pilot programme to produce high-assay low-enriched uranium (Haleu) in the hope of accelerating the next generation of nuclear reactors. ",
            "The DOE plans to spend $115m to help develop advanced fuels for next-generation reactors.Under a three-year pilot project announced yesterday, the money would go to an Ohio company to produce Haleu fuel, which uses a more energy-dense uranium, which the nuclear industry has been asking for to support a budding industry of smaller reactors.DOE officials said they plan to award the contract to American Centrifuge Operating, a unit of Centrus Energy Corp, unless rival companies can make a compelling case by 22 JanuaryMaria Korsnick, president and chief executive officer of the Nuclear Energy Institute lobby group said the pilot programme demonstrates continued confidence in the success of the next generation of advanced nuclear reactors and for new fuel options for the existing fleet.  The DOE’s investment is a significant starting point in the Haleu fuel infrastructure, she said.The NEI said low-enriched uranium fuel used in today's nuclear power plants typically contains less than 5% of fissile uranium-235, but many of the advanced reactor designs currently under development will require Haleu fuel. There are no commercial facilities in the US that are immediately capable of producing Haleu fuel.Centrus Energy says on its website that Haleu fuel has many advantages that improve reactor performance.  Because the U235 is more concentrated, the fuel assemblies and reactors can be smaller, which is one reason why many small modular reactor designs will run on Halue fuel. The reactors do not need to be refuelled as often, and they can achieve higher “burnup” rates, which means less fuel will be required and less waste will be produced.Centrus said it is working under a contract with X-energy, a reactor and fuel company, to pursue the development of a fuel fabrication facility that would produce Haleu fuel that could power a variety of advanced reactors under development around the world, ensuring a US source of supply for this emerging industry."

            "Small modular reactors promise to bring nuclear power to the masses, revolutionising the nuclear power industry by making its production increasingly affordable and available to a far wider market. SMRs are standardised products that are made on a factory production line, rather than bespoke machines that are constructed onsite one at a time. Mass production will ensure consistency in quality and drive down unit costs, compared to traditional, one-off, and complex large reactor designs. SMR components will be much cheaper to transport than those used in traditional large reactors. SMR reactor plant and supporting components are all compact enough to be transported from factory to construction site by boat, lorry or railway; unlike the huge transporters and road closures that are required for larger conventional plants. These designs are also much safer: the smaller reactor cores, simpler systems, and reliance on built-in passive safety features all mean that the size of the emergency planning zone can be reduced to the boundary of the plant, in contrast to the “plume exposure pathway” EPZ, which is up to 16 km, for traditional large nuclear plants. In countries with a smaller electrical grid, for example sub-Saharan Africa and the polar north, SMRs offer advantages for ensuring grid stability. Their power can be delivered in bite-sized morsels to the wider grid, resulting in a stable and incremental expansion of the grid as demand increases. SMRs are also much less demanding in terms of siting as they do not require the same large, low-population zones as traditional reactors. Safety improvements aside, the largest economic advantage of modular design is the great reduction in construction risk. Thanks to an SMR’s factory construction, the site hosting it can be prepared before it arrives, minimising expensive contract variations. This reduction in construction risk should mean that budgets and timelines will be met more reliably.  The UK is easily the most progressive western country when it comes to nuclear power. The government is taking steps in the right direction with significant investment in SMRs, including a fund of up to £20m for supply chain development, £7m for regulatory readiness, and up to £44m in an advanced modular reactor feasibility and development project. In June 2018, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy issued its ambitious nuclear sector deal policy paper. This paper presents plans for cooperation between the government and the civilian sector. Those plans include a 30% reduction in the cost of new-build projects by 2030; lower generation costs and a 20% reduction in decommissioning costs to the taxpayer; and a more competitive supply chain, with more UK companies using advanced manufacturing methods and entering domestic and export markets for nuclear goods and services.As part of the nuclear sector deal, the government will set out a framework to support the development and deployment of SMRs and the technologies that support them.The UK nuclear regulatory framework is goal-based rather than prescriptive, which makes the UK particularly attractive for deploying SMRs. While nuclear reactor vendors are required to demonstrate their safety case to the Office of Nuclear Regulation, the regulations do not prescribe any particular design solution. In other words, the ONR requires that SMRs be safe, but it doesn’t tell the manufacturer how to make them safe – that is the job of the designer. As for cost, the current market for nuclear power is largely limited to wealthy buyers with deep pockets. But, thanks to its small and modular design, the production time, introduction period and safety management of SMRs are all considerably reduced. With this in mind, the cost of implementing this technology into global power grids should be significantly lower than traditional large reactors. The other positive news is that development of SMRs in the UK should not be disproportionately impacted by Brexit and withdrawal from the Euratom treaty. In the very near term, the UK will need to establish bilateral nuclear cooperation treaties with major supplier countries in the EU and elsewhere, but it has already begun to do this. Western powers, such as Canada, France and the US, are developing SMRs. There are also promising new designs from China, Russia, and Japan. However, it seems that the UK is the most likely to make the greatest strides in SMR development, given the government’s support of nuclear. Realistically, the earliest an SMR will be operational in the UK is probably the early 2030s. That may seem a long time, but there is a lot that needs to happen between now and commercial operation. Supply chains will need to be developed, ONR generic design assessments will need to be completed, the SMR manufacturing facility will need to be designed and built, and a site will need to be identified and prepared to accept the SMR. All of this takes time, but if the government holds its current course, all of these challenges can be overcome.>>>>> Vincent Zabielski is a specialist nuclear lawyer at London-based law firm Pillsbury, focusing on international nuclear energy matters, including advice related to new-build EPC contracts, power purchase agreements, operation and maintenance, fuel supply chain, liability issues, and export controls.

            "15 Oct (NucNet): Significant advances have been made in recent years on small modular reactors with about 50 SMR concepts at various stages of development around the world and commercial operations expected to begin “in the coming years”, the International Atomic Energy Agency said.",
            "According to the IAEA, SMRs have the potential to meet the needs of a wide range of users and to be low-carbon replacements for ageing fossil fuel-fired power plants. They have improved safety features and are suitable for non-electric applications, such as cooling, heating and water desalination. The agency said some SMRs will use pre-fabricated systems and components to shorten construction schedules and offer greater flexibility and affordability than traditional nuclear power plants. They also offer options for countries with smaller electricity grids, regions with less developed infrastructure and for energy systems that combine nuclear and alternative sources, including renewables.SMRs require less upfront capital per unit, but their electricity generating cost will probably be higher than that of large reactors. Their costs will be weighed against alternatives and competitiveness will need to be pursued through economies of scale. “An expeditious deployment of SMRs will involve the development of a resilient supply chain, human resources and a robust regulatory framework,” the agency said.The IAEA recently released two new publications on SMRs: Deployment Indicators for Small Modular Reactors, which provides member states with a methodology for evaluating the potential deployment of SMRs; and an updated edition of Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments, which provides an overview of the status of SMR designs around the world.Details online: https://bit.ly/2P0Vraj"

            "“The United States cannot ignore the national security implications of China’ efforts to obtain nuclear technology outside of established processes of US-China civil nuclear cooperation,” energy secretary Rick Perry said in the statement.The decision is the result of a broad government policy review led by the National Security Council and is driven by Beijing’s efforts to obtain advanced technology, nuclear material and equipment from US companies.The review, which examined the economic and national security ramifications, was prompted by China's efforts to gain US intellectual property, sometimes illicitly, in ways that undermine American businesses and the military, officials told the media.One administration official said China is “actively pursuing our advanced nuclear technology for diversion to military use in its third-generation nuclear power submarine, in the development of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and in strategic dual use nuclear-powered platforms, such as small modular reactors and floating nuclear power plants deployable in the South China Sea”.The new policy, which goes into effect immediately, sets guidelines for all existing, pending and future technology transfers to China, administration officials said. They said the US is particularly concerned about technology that can power submarines, aircraft carriers and SMRs that could be used in floating power plants in South China Sea.US nuclear exports to China amounted to $170m in 2017. The administration carefully weighed the economic impact, an official said, but was acting because it “must first and foremost protect” national security."

            "US-based GA said both Congress and the DoD have identified energy security as a key issue for the US armed forces. As the military becomes more reliant on advanced computing and networking for its tasks, and moves towards the deployment of advanced weapons with large power demands, it has become critically dependent on resilient sources of electricity.Yet almost all DoD installations depend on grid power, which can suffer outages at any time, GA said. Backup electricity is provided by diesel generators that lack sufficient reliability and are themselves dependent on limited local fuel storage. In part because of these concerns, Congress has directed the DoD and the Department of Energy to study the possible deployment of micro-reactors of 10 MW and less no later than 2027.GA said micro-reactors can be factory-manufactured and assembled much more rapidly than large commercial nuclear plants. Also unlike larger plants, they can be developed and deployed in much shorter periods of time. A recent report by the Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute said the first such system could be deployed domestically by the DoD in as little as five to seven years with sufficient funding and support, especially from DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.The use of micro-reactors for resilient power in remote locations is an option being examined by other nations. GA said both Canada and the UK have advanced government programmes underway with the goal of deploying small reactors within the next decade.GA is developing a mobile nuclear power supply that is truck/air shippable and would fit in a standard military shipping container. This modular, autonomous system has a load-following generating capacity of up to 10 MW and a refuelling period greater than 10 years."

The design, as approved, would produce approximately 1,400 MW of electricity. The NRC said the APR1400 features systems to safely shut down the reactor or mitigate the effects of an accident. The standard design approval does not grant permission to build or operate a reactor. Full certification, if granted by the NRC, is also valid for 15 years and allows a utility to reference the design when applying for a combined licence to build and operate a nuclear power plant. The NRC is also reviewing applications to certify two other designs: Mitsubishi’s US Advanced Pressurised Water Reactor and NuScale’s small modular reactor.

            "The NEI, which represents the US nuclear industry, said the “potential regulatory breakthrough” could accelerate deployment of small modular and advanced reactors.The NEI said in the finding came during a preliminary assessment of Tennessee Valley Authority’s (TVA) early site permit application for the potential deployment of SMRsIn May 2016, TVA, a government-owned corporation, applied to the NRC for permission for the construction and operation of SMR units at the Clinch River site near Oak Ridge, Tennessee.TVA said at the time it was the first company to submit any type of application related to SMRs to the regulator.The NRC said it would use the application to review site safety, environmental and emergency preparedness requirements for the project.According to the NEI, TVA’s application used information from four SMR designs – BWXT’s mPower, Holtec International’s SMR-160, NuScale Power’s SMR and Westinghouse’s SMR – to assess a possible exemption for TVA to the existing 10-mile emergency planning zone required under US law. The NEI said TVA’s application showed that certain SMR characteristics, like the smaller amount of fuel in the reactor cores, simpler systems, and reliance on built-in passive safety features, eliminate several potential emergency scenarios.Details are online: http://bit.ly/2PH7kjj "

            "7 Aug (NucNet): Small modular reactors should be offered the same subsidies as those provided to offshore wind, an independent finance working group appointed by the government has concluded, according to the Financial Times.",
            "The subsidies, which should include a contract-for-difference to guarantee a minimum price for electricity, would help to commercialise the nascent SMR industry in the UK, the Expert Finance Working Group on Small Reactors was reported to have said.The group added that the government should select projects on the basis of commercial readiness and not select a preferred project. The Financial Times said this could be considered a blow to Rolls Royce, which recently warned it will shut down its SMR project if the government does not make a long-term commitment to its technology.The group was set up in February 2018 to advise on how SMR projects could raise investment in the UK.In June the government said the group’s analysis suggested that the UK is well placed to develop first-of-a-kind SMR projects and that the characteristics of SMRs could attract private investment.According to the UK’s Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, initial cost modelling suggests that SMRs will not be significantly cheaper, in terms of capital cost per megawatt output, than the current generation of gigawatt-scale reactors.A 2014 SMR feasibility study led by the National Nuclear Laboratory gave a best estimate of over £80/MWh – not far from the strike price agreed for Hinkley Point C. However, Rolls-Royce said it was targeting a price of £60/MWh for its SMR design.The UK government expressed support for domestic SMR development in the 2016 Budget and launched a competition to identify the best-value design for the UK. The competition considered SMR designs which generate up to 300MW and which are able to achieve in-factory production of modular components or systems amounting to a minimum of 40% of the total plant cost.That competition was closed in December 2017, with the publication of a series of techno-economic assessments of SMRs.The government has since launched a programme to support and develop feasibility projects for SMRs. Funding announced in June included up to £44m for research and development to support the development of advanced SMRs."

            "The phasing out of nuclear power in Germany is, at least for the time being, prolonging dependence on coal, said the paper, published by Imperial College’s Grantham Institute - Climate Change and Environment.Nuclear power is the largest source of low-carbon electricity in the developed world and the second largest, after hydro, in the world as a whole. In countries with limited hydro power, it is also one of the few options for low-carbon electricity that do not depend on local weather conditions. The paper points out that in France, which largely relies on nuclear power for its electricity, has reduced the carbon intensity of its economy to less than half the average for developed nations. Countries such as China, India, and Pakistan, where much of the growth in future energy demand will be concentrated, are continuing to invest in new nuclear power stations. “Currently we cannot rely on variable renewables without the need for baseline generation such as nuclear,” the paper concluded. However, if nuclear power is to fulfil its potential to provide reliable low-carbon electricity, “the industry will need to demonstrate reliable construction, reduced costs, and greater flexibility of operation”.In the UK, the government’s decision to procure a two-unit, 3.2 GW nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C is a big risk, but also represents a crucial opportunity for the conventional nuclear industry, which is under significant financial stress, to rebuild itself.The successful completion of two EPR units supplied by EDF at Hinkley Point C and reductions in the cost of subsequent nuclear power stations will be critical for the future of the industry in the UK. “UK government policy supports a new programme of nuclear power and the recent agreement to guarantee the price of electricity from Hinkley Point C is a major first step,” the paper said. “Much will depend on the successful construction of this station.”Cost is probably the most controversial aspect of nuclear power in the UK today, the paper said. In the US and Europe, the nuclear industry has found it difficult to compete with cheap gas and with increasingly competitive renewables.To get Hinkley Point C agreed the government has guaranteed an index linked price for its power, of £92.50 (2012 prices) per MWh over 35 years. This is more than twice the current wholesale price of electricity in the UK. It is also significantly above the prices of £74.75 for 2021/22 projects and £57.50 for 2022/23 projects for offshore wind. If the Sizewell EPR goes ahead the contract price of Hinkley Point C will be reduced to £89.50 per MWh. A report earlier this year by the UK-based Energy Technology Institute said there was “strong evidence” from projects outside Europe and the US that cost reductions of around 35% can be made to nuclear new build projects in the UK. EDF has put the cost of Hinkley Point C at around £20bn, or approximately £6,250 ($8,020) per kilowatt.The report put the total capital cost of the Flamanville-3 nuclear plant under construction in France at a little over $10,000/kW. The Olkiluoto-3 plant under construction in Finland is about $9,600/kW. The report put the total capital cost of construction in China in a range of about $1,700 to $5,000/kW. In Russia the cost is about $2,500 to around $3,600/kW.There is no simple comparison with the cost of offshore wind, the paper concluded. Hinkley Point C will provide reliable power, whereas offshore wind power is intermittent. The Hinkley Point C price guarantee runs for 35 years whereas the offshore wind guarantee is only 15 years. “On the other hand, Hinkley Point C will probably have at least 30 years of life after the price guarantee has ended, whereas the post-subsidy life of wind farms is expected to be much shorter.”the Hinkley Point C price is “not necessarily a good guide to the true cost of a new nuclear programme, such as the government proposes, in the UK”. The Hinkley Point EPR is the first of its kind in the UK, and no station to this design has yet been commissioned anywhere in the world. Furthermore, the UK has had no experience of new nuclear construction since Sizewell B was commissioned in 1995. Even with this degree of government support, there is no certainty that Hinkley Point will be completed without further help. EDF, who are bearing two thirds of the cost, are experiencing considerable financial stress. “If the project suffers serious delays, as other EPR project have done, completion may depend on the willingness of the French government to provide additional support,” the paper said.“On the other hand, if Hinkley Point is completed within time and budget, it will be highly profitable and this could open the door for repeat orders of the EPR at somewhat lower cost, due to the experience gained.”According to the paper, nuclear power will be essential for meeting the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, unless the country can adapt to depend largely on variable wind and solar, or there is a breakthrough in the commercialisation of carbon capture and storage.The need for nuclear may be greater if electricity becomes the preferred low-carbon solution for transport and heat.The paper concluded that investment in nuclear power is “risky”. Nuclear power stations take time to build and require heavy up-front investment, but should last for 60 years or more. In the US and Europe the cost of new builds has been high and construction performance troubled. “As a result, it is difficult to attract private investment,” the paper said.It said the UK may regret building nuclear power stations if the cost of renewables continues to fall and we find solutions to the problem of the variability of these generation sources. “On the other hand, if progress in reducing the costs of energy storage is insufficient, we may not be able to achieve climate targets without new nuclear generation capacity.”.Small modular reactors (SMRs), currently being assessed by the UK government, could be largely factory built and less prone to construction delays than larger plants. The smaller unit size should make them easier to finance and more flexible to deploy.The paper said advanced reactor concepts, including advanced SMRs, are under development for the longer term. These aim to deliver low-carbon energy solutions, such as high-grade heat for industrial processes, as well as improved economics and safety.The paper is online: https://bit.ly/2M7XV28"

Bruce Power will spend CAD13bn to refurbish six of the eight nuclear reactors at the Bruce nuclear station.The Canadian Nuclear Association said refurbishment will provide clean electrical production for another 25-30 years, supporting increased deployment of renewables and further reducing Canada’s reliance on fossil fuels.Ms Velshi, who will succeed Michael Binder at the CNSC next month, also said the CNSC has a key role to play in positioning Canada to become a global leader in emerging nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors.She said: “The CNSC can help drive policy makers, government officials and industry to solutions to address regulatory challenges that will be front and centre for the sector in years to come. I am thinking here, for example, of long-term nuclear waste management.”Ms Velshi said public trust in the nuclear industry needs to be improved by increasing transparency. “A recurring concern we still hear from many members of the public is that they need more information,” she said."

            "5 Jul (NucNet): Nuclear power holds the potential to make a significant contribution to decarbonising the US energy system, but whether it could do so in its current form is a critical question, a report by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University’s Department of Engineering and Public Policy says.",
            "The report, published in in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, says existing large light water reactors in the US are under economic pressure from low natural gas prices, and some have already closed. Moreover, because of their great cost and complexity, it appears most unlikely that any new large plants will be built over the next several decades. “It should be a source of profound concern for all who care about climate change that, for entirely predictable and resolvable reasons, the US appears set to virtually lose nuclear power, and thus a wedge of reliable and low-carbon energy, over the next few decades,” the report concludes.The report says that while advanced reactor designs are sometimes held up as a potential solution to nuclear power’s challenges, assessment of the advanced fission enterprise suggests that no US design will be commercialised before mid-century. “That leaves factory-manufactured, light water small modular reactors (SMRs) as the only option that might be deployed at significant scale in the climate-critical period of the next several decades.“We have systematically investigated how a domestic market could develop to support that industry over the next several decades and, in the absence of a dramatic change in the policy environment, have been unable to make a convincing case.”The report concludes that achieving deep decarbonization of the energy system will require a portfolio of “every available technology and strategy we can muster”.

            "The US Department of Energy, he said, is studying ways to bail out nuclear (and coal) facilities, including potentially by mandating grid operators to purchase power from them.Supporters say it’s a sensible move because the nation’s power grid cannot rely solely on natural gas, wind, and solar. Opponents of the nuclear industry say nuclear power that was once advertised as being “too cheap to meter” has become too costly for electric utilities to buy. The US has the largest number of nuclear plants in the world – 99 in commercial operation providing 20% of its electricity generation – but its industry leadership is declining as efforts to build a new generation of reactors have been plagued by problems, and aging plants have been retired or closed in the face of economic, market, and financial pressures.The situation, exacerbated by robust competition in the new-build sector from China and Russia, has seen the nuclear industry and its supporters call on the government to enact legislation that would support the continued operation of nuclear plants.But the main reason behind nuclear’s problems in the US, says Dr J. Winston Porter, a national energy and environmental consultant and former assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency, is a shale revolution that has produced a rapid supply of inexpensive and relatively clean natural gas. “Because of this we are becoming increasingly dependent on it for most electricity production,” he said. “Consequently, we risk losing the energy diversity that has long served as a bulwark of the US energy system. “The problem may be an eventual lack of robust competition. One can even ask, ‘What will be the cost of natural gas when it is our only major source of electric power?’”Mr Perry said bailing out nuclear power plants is as important to national security as keeping the military strong, and that the cost to Americans should not be an issue.“You cannot put a dollar figure on the cost to keep America free,” he told reporters at a press conference in Washington, when asked about the administration’s effort to extend the lives of the facilities. When asked about the cost of a potential bailout, he said he did not yet know.The nuclear industry has long argued that electricity markets should be reformed to recognise the ability of traditional baseload generation with onsite fuel supplies – including nuclear power plants – to provide grid resiliency during extreme events like hurricanes or extreme winter weather.A report by the Washington-based think-tank the Atlantic Council argued that the US nuclear energy industry is facing a crisis that the Trump administration must immediately address as a core part of its “all of the above” energy strategy that is intended to herald an era of American energy dominance. The good news is that the Trump administration recognises the problem, supports nuclear energy, and sees new generation nuclear technology such as small modular reactors as a key part of its energy strategy.According to promoters of SMRs, these scaled-down reactors could solve the challenges faced by nuclear power. SMR developers promise lowered costs, decreased production of radioactive waste, reduction or elimination of the risk of severe accidents, and no contribution to nuclear proliferation. Dozens of companies – both in the US and the rest of the world – are developing their own SMR designs, and many have received funding from wealthy private investors and the DOE.The need for a new direction is evident. Six US nuclear plants have been shut down permanently since 2013 and 12 more are slated to retire over the next seven years. That means a total of 18 shutdowns that will remove more than 15.8 GW of generation from the grid, or 15% of existing nuclear capacity.Only two nuclear plants, the Vogtle-3 and -4 Westinghouse AP1000 units in Georgia, are under construction. Construction of the Summer-3 and -4 AP1000 plants in South Carolina was abandoned in August 2017 following analysis of schedule and cost data from Westinghouse and subcontractor Fluor Corporation. South Carolina Electric & Gas owned 55% of the project and state-owned utility Santee Cooper the remaining 45%.The Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the nuclear industry in the US, said the US electricity grid is enduring “unprecedented tumult and challenge” because of the loss of thousands and thousands of megawatts of carbon-free, fuel-secure generation that nuclear plants represent. Closing nuclear plants makes electricity prices go up and is putting emissions reduction targets hopelessly out of reach, NEI president and chief executive officer Maria Korsnick said.The Atlantic Council said the decline of the nuclear power industry in the US is “an important policy problem” that is not receiving the attention it deserves. The report was made public in March 2018, in the same week that Ohio-based utility FirstEnergy announced plans to permanently shut down its three nuclear power stations – Davis-Besse, Perry and Beaver Valley – within the next three years without some kind of state or federal relief.To save financially-ailing nuclear plants, state legislatures in Illinois and New York last year approved subsidies to keep nuclear plants operating after utilities made appeals about protecting consumers and jobs. Other proposed bailouts of nuclear plants have stalled in New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In Minnesota, the state legislature is considering a bill that would help Xcel Energy, owner and operator of the Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear stations, plan for the high costs of maintaining old nuclear power plants. The proposed legislation would give utilities earlier notice about how much money they could recover for costly work, Minnesota Public Radio reported.The NEI confirmed that Mr Trump had ordered Mr Perry to “prepare immediate steps” to stop premature closures of “fuel-secure” nuclear and coal power plants and prevent further risks to national security and grid resilience.This reflects the administration’s focus on grid resilience, which began last September when Mr Perry directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to “take swift action” to address threats to the resiliency of the US electric grid. Last week, in another signal that momentum for change is gathering pace, a broad coalition of 75 former US statesmen, national security officials and industry leaders urged Mr Perry to take immediate action to prevent the closure of nuclear reactors.The signatories urge Mr Perry to take concrete steps to ensure the national security attributes of US nuclear power plants are properly recognised by policymakers and are valued in US electricity markets.The letter, posted online by the Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute lobby group, said the national security benefits of a strong domestic nuclear energy sector take many forms, many of which overlap and together are woven into the nation’s greater strength and resilience.Nuclear power plants are among the most robust elements of US critical infrastructure, the letter said. They have up to two years’ worth of fuel on site, providing valuable fuel diversity and increasing the resilience of the electrical grid by eliminating the supply vulnerabilities that some other forms of energy supply face.Congress continues to demonstrate bipartisan support for nuclear energy, with the Senate passing an appropriations bill last week that provides $1.2bn for the DOE’s nuclear energy programmes. The overwhelming 86-5 vote on the spending package came just over two weeks after the House passed a similar bill that also saw strong funding for nuclear energy.And in what the NEI called “a demonstration of the Trump administration’s continued support for revitalising the commercial nuclear industry”, the DOE recently announced nearly $64m in funding for advanced nuclear energy technology projects to be carried out by DOE national laboratories, universities and private companies.In recent months, the DOE has provided almost $90m in funding for advanced nuclear R&D projects through several different mechanisms, the NEI said.Meanwhile, the age of the existing nuclear fleet is a problem for the present. That’s not because America’s nuclear reactors are falling apart –they are regularly inspected, and almost all of them have now gone through the process of renewing their original 40-year operating licences for 20 more years, said David McIntyre, a public affairs officer at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A few, including the Turkey Point nuclear station in Florida, have even put in for a second round of renewals that could give them the ability to operate for a total of 80 years.Instead, it is the cost of upkeep that is prohibitive. Components degrade and break down, especially components exposed to radiation on a daily basis. Maintenance and repair, upgrades and rejuvenation all take investment. And right now, that means spending lots of money on power plants that are not especially profitable. "

            "2 Jul (NucNet): The US has the largest number of nuclear plants in the world – 99 in commercial operation providing 20% of its electricity generation – but its leadership in the industry is declining as efforts to build a new generation of reactors have been plagued by problems, and aging plants have been retired or closed in the face of economic, market, and financial pressures.",
            "The situation, exacerbated by competition in the overseas new-build sector from China and Russia, has seen the nuclear industry and its supporters call on the government to enact legislation that would support the continued operation of nuclear plants.The industry has long argued that electricity markets should be reformed to recognise the ability of traditional baseload generation with onsite fuel supplies – including nuclear power plants – to provide grid resiliency during extreme events like hurricanes or extreme winter weather.A recent report by the Washington-based think-tank the Atlantic Council issued a stark warning, arguing that the US nuclear energy industry is facing a crisis that the Trump administration must immediately address. The good news is that the Trump administration recognises the problem, supports nuclear energy, and sees new generation nuclear technology such as small modular reactors as a key part of its energy strategy.Six US nuclear plants have been shut down permanently since 2013 and 12 more are slated to retire over the next seven years. That means a total of 18 shutdowns that will remove more than 15.87 GW of generation from the grid, or around 15% of existing nuclear capacity.Only two nuclear plants, the Vogtle-3 and -4 Westinghouse AP1000 units in Georgia, are under construction.The Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the nuclear industry in the US, said the US electricity grid is enduring “unprecedented tumult and challenge” because of the loss of thousands and thousands of megawatts of carbon-free, fuel-secure generation that nuclear plants represent. Closing nuclear plants makes electricity prices go up and is putting emissions reduction targets hopelessly out of reach, NEI president and chief executive officer Maria Korsnick said.The Atlantic Council said the decline of the nuclear power industry in the US is “an important policy problem” that is not receiving the attention it deserves. The report was made public in March 2018, in the same week that Ohio-based utility FirstEnergy announced plans to permanently shut down its three nuclear power stations – Davis-Besse, Perry and Beaver Valley – within the next three years without some kind of state or federal relief.Nuclear Energy In The US: Download the NucNet InfographicNucNet special report: A Stark Warning To Trump On China, Russia And The ‘Crisis’ Facing US Nuclear Industry "

            "28 Jun (NucNet): The UK government has announced an ambitious £200m funding deal with the nuclear sector that could lead to a new generation small modular reactor being built at an existing nuclear site in north Wales.",
            "The government said the nuclear deal will ensure that nuclear energy continues to power the UK for years to come through major innovation, cutting-edge technology and ensuring a diverse and highly-skilled workforce.The deal, part of the country’s long-term industrial strategy, is worth over £200m and follows the government’s recent announcement that it is to enter into negotiations with Hitachi over plans to build two UK Advanced-Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) units at Wylfa Newydd on the island of Anglesey in north Wales.The government said the deal will spearhead Britain’s move towards cleaner economic growth. It focuses on innovation to develop the technology and skills needed to maintain the UK’s position as “one of the world’s leading nuclear countries”.While the bulk of the £200m investment is confirmation of support pledged last year, the site chosen to launch the sector deal is being seen as significant.The Trawsfynydd nuclear site, in north Wales, is seen as a possible location for an SMR.About £56m will go to help eight vendors of SMRs carry out technical studies.Alun Cairns, secretary of state for Wales, said Trawsfynydd is ready to be transformed with little upgrade needed to the grid infrastructure. “It’s in the right place with the right people and good links to leading academic research institutions in the nuclear sector. The kind of small reactor which could be sited in Trawsfynydd is set to usher in an era of cost-effective power with equipment put together off site and transported to locations like this for relatively easy assembly.”Trawsfynydd, which had two 195-MW gas-cooled Magnox reactors, is on a 15-hectare site, on an inland lake in Snowdonia National Park.Trawsfynydd was the first inland civil Magnox nuclear station. It started service in 1965 and generated 69 TWh of electricity over the 26 years until its closure in 1991.In 2016 a committee of MPs said Trawsfynydd should be designated as a site for a first-of-its kind SMR station. They said progress should to be made soon if the UK wants to be “first to market” for SMRs.The deal includes £86m in government funding for fusion research at the UK Atomic Energy Authority’s science centre in Culham in Oxfordshire, and up to £44m for research and development funding to support the development of advanced modular reactors.The government said as a result of the deal, the nuclear industry will cut costs of new nuclear power stations by 30% by 2030, while cutting the cost of decommissioning old nuclear sites by up to a fifth.The nuclear deal is online: https://bit.ly/2Krg35W"

            "27 Jun (NucNet): Continuous improvement in reactor designs in the coming years could make nuclear power more cost-effective and help to alleviate public concerns on issues such as safety and waste disposal, International Atomic Energy Agency director-general Yukiya Amano said in his keynote address at the 2018 World Nuclear Exhibition event in Paris, France, today.",
            "Mr Amano said advanced water-cooled reactors with innovative safety measures and small modular reactors could  play a key role in the replacement and expansion of the global nuclear fleet. He said it was essential that robust levels of nuclear safety consistent with IAEA safety standards should be in place at every nuclear power plant. “In many countries, public acceptance remains the most important issue to be addressed when it comes to nuclear power. Enhanced safety helps to increase public confidence in nuclear power,” he said.Mr Amano said he believes it will be difficult for the world to meet the challenges of securing sufficient energy, and of limiting the average global temperature increase to 2 degrees centigrade, without making more use of nuclear power.Renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar power would play an increasingly important role in the future. “However, these are intermittent energy sources which cannot meet countries’ needs on their own. That means more use of nuclear power will be needed,” Mr Amano said."

            "Mr Amano told the International Symposium on Uranium Raw Material for the Nuclear Fuel Cycle that it is also essential to take full account of environmental concerns, both to ensure public acceptance today and to avoid troubling legacy issues in the future.Delegates at the Vienna meeting are discussing the latest research and technologies related to the development of new uranium sources, and the technical, economic, environmental, safety and social aspects of uranium exploration and mining.Mr Amano said he believes it will be difficult for the world to meet the twin challenges of securing sufficient energy and limiting the average global temperature increase to two degrees centigrade in the coming decades without making more use of nuclear power.IAEA projections show that nuclear power’s global potential up to 2050 remains high, but its expansion is expected to slow in the coming years.Mr Amano said promising work is underway on new generations of nuclear power reactors that require less uranium, including some types of small, medium-sized or modular reactors. Some countries are interested in the thorium fuel cycle.“However, for the foreseeable future, most new nuclear power technologies will still run, wholly or partially, on uranium,” he said.He said there are 451 commercial nuclear power reactors in operation in 30 countries. Another 58 reactors are under construction, mostly in Asia. Some 30 countries are considering introducing nuclear power."

            "12 Jun (NucNet): Jordan has scrapped a $10bn (€8.5bn) deal with Russia to build the Middle Eastern kingdom’s first nuclear power station, reports in local media said today.",
            "The Jordan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) sent a statement to the Jordan Times saying the Jordanian government decided to abandon the deal with Russia over disagreements on its financing.“The Russians requested obtaining loans from commercial banks, which would have increased the cost of the project and the prices of generated electricity. The Jordanian government rejected the proposal”, the statement said.Commercial loans would have made the prices of electricity generated by the proposed nuclear station uncompetitive, JAEC said.A statement published on JAEC’s official website said that a meeting was called in 2017 to work out a final investment decision for the project and potentially attracting external financing and investors.In September 2014, Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom signed a pre-investment contract for the construction in Jordan of two VVER-1000 units. In March 2015, Rosatom and JAEC signed an intergovernmental agreement for construction of the units. The first unit was expected to go online in 2022.JAEC said it has conducted a number of feasibility and technical studies on the nuclear power station project, which were not fully related to the use of Russian technology.The nuclear station project will be continued and open to the eventual participation of other technology providers, JAEC said.In May 2018, JAEC signed an agreement with Rosatom to perform a feasibility study on the deployment of a low-power small modular reactor (SMR).In November 2017, Rolls-Royce signed a memorandum of understanding with JAEC to carry out a technical feasibility study for the construction of a Rolls-Royce SMR in Jordan.JAEC said it is also interested in developing high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTR) technology."

The UK has said it will leave Euratom when it quits the EU on 29 March 2019. Euratom covers issues such as the transport of radioactive materials, including those used in medical treatments and in nuclear power stations.The NEI said that because the UK has announced significant plans to develop new nuclear plants in the years ahead, including possibly small modular reactors, a new Section 123 agreement is critical for US nuclear exports and American jobs.Dan Lipman, vice-president of suppliers, new reactors, and international programmes at the NEI, said the UK government’s decision to invest in new nuclear power generation is based on recognition that nuclear energy is a clean, reliable and emissions-free energy source that reduces the nation’s reliance on imported fossil fuels. Mr Lipman said: “The UK government’s ambitious development plans have made it the most important nuclear technology export market after China, according to a US Department of Commerce report, making the Section 123 agreement welcome news for US firms.”"

NRG also intends to use advanced 3D simulation techniques to confirm the feasibility of certain design safety features which cannot be evaluated using conventional simulation techniques.In the long-term, LeadCold intends to construct an electrically heated model of its reactor. This should allow additional experimental verification of both the advanced design safety features and the simulation techniques applied by NRG. The collaboration will put advanced simulation techniques developed at NRG as part of the Dutch national R&D programme to the test, NRG project manager Ferry Roelofs said. Janne Wallenius, LeadCold’s chief executive officer, said NRG’s advanced simulation techniques should confirm proper functioning of the reactor’s safety features and help convince safety authorities of LeadCold’s approach.LeadCold was founded in 2013 with its head office in Stockholm and a Canadian subsidiary.

The new bill removes that deadline and ensures that the two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors being built at Southern Nuclear Operating Company’s Vogtle site in Georgia can benefit from the credit.The 6,000-MW capacity limit also means that the PTC will benefit plans by NuScale Power and its consortium partners to build a commercial small modular reactor power station at the Idaho National Laboratory by 2026, the NEI said.NEI president and chief executive officer Maria Korsnick welcomed the new legislation and said that it showed the US’s commitment to retain its leadership in commercial nuclear technology. Ms Korsnick said: “The bipartisan vote by both houses of Congress to allow new reactors to receive the nuclear production tax-credit also was a vote for continued American leadership in nuclear energy, environmental stewardship and thousands of jobs.”The nuclear PTC provision is part of a much larger piece of legislation that seeks to reform the country’s tax code."

The Committee should encourage the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to instruct regional transmission organisations to move forward with price reforms in order to recognise the grid stability contributions of baseload power, among which is nuclear. Ms Korsnick said that Congress should support the timely deployment of accident tolerant fuels, small modular reactors and advanced reactors. In particular, lawmakers should establish deadlines for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review new fuel types and advanced reactor designs.Congress should streamline the nuclear export review process and expand nuclear project finance opportunities to help level the playing field for US nuclear companies that compete against foreign government-controlled entities, Ms Korsnick said.Ms Korsnick’s testimony included three other issues to be addressed by Congress: to complete the reform of the federal used fuel management programme without watering down its funding aspects; to modernise the NRC’s “outdated” fee structure, regulatory requirements and licensing processes; and to provide federal funding for decontamination and decommissioning of legacy gaseous diffusion plants.Last month, the FERC decided not to adopt a proposal that would have required markets to compensate “fuel-secure baseload electricity generation” such as nuclear. The nuclear industry says it is under economic pressure due to decreasing demand and competition from natural gas and renewables, and this was a “missed opportunity” to support nuclear plants, whose attributes include resiliency and reliability, are not being fairly valued in the market.Ms Korsnick’s testimony is online: https://bit.ly/2sdxrGV "

            "2 Feb (NucNet): A study funded by the US Department of Energy recommends that federal agencies such as the DOE and the Defence Department be allowed to enter into 30-year power purchase agreements with utility operators of small modular reactors (SMRs). ",
            "SMRs are a good fit for sites like the DOE’s 17 national laboratories, the study says.For example, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee is the largest consumer of electricity among the agency’s sites and is engaged in several critical, round-the-clock defence and research-related activities.“An SMR located in the correct area can provide a significant benefit to secure the facility and ensure long-term operation without refueling (SMRs easily store two years’ worth of fuel on-site),” the study says. “Similar to aircraft carriers and submarines that are powered by nuclear power, no other power source can provide that much certainty to a land-based defence facility.”Long-term power purchase agreements between a federal agency customer and power-producing utility would help to significantly reduce the risk of constructing and operating the first small modular reactors in the US, the study says.The study also calls on the government to include nuclear power in the definition of “clean power,” and encourage states to support SMRs giving them credit for the zero-carbon energy.The study is online: http://bit.ly/2FFWCDU"

            "26 Jan (NucNet): In a white paper published this week the US nuclear industry has set out a number of recommendations about how the regulator can streamline licensing of advanced reactors to ensure the country’s leadership in nuclear energy.",
            "Developed by the Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute in coordination with the Nuclear Innovation Alliance and the US Nuclear Infrastructure Council, the white paper outlines proposals to support innovation, commercialisation and deployment of new nuclear technology.The paper calls on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to reverse the trend of increasing regulatory costs and excessively long reviews. It urges the NRC to begin taking steps against “regulatory creep” by focusing its licensing reviews on areas that are safety-significant. The NRC should also align the regulatory framework for advanced reactors with their inherent enhanced safety, the paper says. The NRC needs to continue its work with the industry to tailor its regulatory guidance and regulations to address reactor designs other than the large light water reactors for which it has developed its current decades-long regulatory framework, the NEI said.Among the potential inherent safety features of advanced reactors that should be reflected in design reviews are less complex designs leading to larger safety margins, slower accident progression, less likely and smaller off-site releases, and smaller emergency planning zones. Several US-based reactor developers are preparing innovative designs for licensing in the next decade or so, including small modular reactors and non-light water based advanced reactor designs.The NEI said: “However, without a modernised, streamlined and safety-focused licensing process that accounts for the unique safety characteristics of these designs, this technology leadership is at risk and other countries will begin to outpace the US in the international market for advanced nuclear technology.”Details online: http://bit.ly/2GjBiFp"

Asked about plans to build six AP1000s in Andhra Pradesh, India, the company said: “We continue to pursue the India bids as they were structured in a manner that does not include construction risk.” Westinghouse also said it would continue to cooperate with the UK on the development and eventual deployment of a small modular reactor. “We believe there is great value in the Westinghouse SMR, which applies the AP1000 plant safety technology into a 200 MW-class reactor.”"

The society said a feasibility study will be carried out into the potential for SMRs to replace fossil fuel-burning in cities around the Helsinki metropolitan area. Several advanced SMRs are in development and coming to market by 2030 that could meet the specifications, the society said. Most of the district heating in Finland is produced by burning coal, natural gas, wood fuels and peat. While many Finnish cities have progressive climate policies and goals, they have struggled to decarbonise heating and liquid fuels, the society said. Rauli Partanen, vice-chair of the society and an independent energy analyst and author, said there are “significant economic possibilities” in producing combined heat and power (CHP) with nuclear reactors. He said: “With CHP, the reactor could produce roughly twice the value per installed capacity compared with just electricity production, while at the same time decarbonising heat production.” He said nuclear is great for baseload needs, but with advanced technologies such as high temperature reactors and high temperature electrolysis, nuclear can also be used to decarbonise not just electricity, heat but also transportation fuels and many industries”."

The report, ‘Nuclear Power: A Future Pathway for the UK’, follows government announcements last week on its support for the next generation of nuclear technologies. The report says the UK needs to have a fleet of affordable SMRs generating by 2040. Old nuclear needs to be replaced with new nuclear by 2030 and Generation IV and fusion plants need to be developed for beyond 2050. It says there are three “roadblocks” to the UK’s plans for new nuclear. Brexatom needs to be addressed urgently, otherwise the entire UK nuclear industry will not be able to function. A timetable is needed for a deep geological disposal facility and firm plans should be put in place for disposal of the UK’s plutonium stockpile. The report urges the government to identify new potential nuclear sites beyond 2025, including sites for SMRs. It also calls on the government to add nuclear construction skills to the shortage occupation list. This would allow experienced workers from oversees to enter the UK.

            "8 Dec (NucNet): The estimated first-of-a-kind (FOAK) cost of electricity from a generic small modular reactor (SMR) deployed in the UK after 2030 is 30% higher than the government’s estimate for large nuclear commissioning, but 7% lower than offshore wind and between 16% lower and 3% higher than combined cycle gas turbines, according to a government study. For integral pressurised water reactor SMRs, overnight capital costs are higher than for large nuclear due to a premium on FOAK costs and reduced economies of scale. For other SMR designs, cost estimates are not sufficiently developed to make valid comparisons. The study, by the consultancy Atkins for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said there was “a great deal of uncertainty with regards to the economics” of SMRs. However, the authors said such reactors should be able to cut costs more quickly than large ones because they could be built and put into service in less time. The degree of cost reduction for SMRs is sensitive to a number of assumptions, said the study, including the rate of UK deployment, a change in regulatory approach to consistently commission a single design over time, and the development of a global market for SMRs, of which the UK design achieves a 10% share. SMRs have the potential to create broader economic advantages to the UK, the study said. Between 2017 and 2040, the estimated net impact – accounting for direct, supply chain and consumer spending – could be around £1.7bn (€1.9bn, $2.2bn) including £0.6bn in taxes and average employment of 800 jobs a year.

The report, ‘Creating confident investors and competitive advantage for the UK nuclear supply chain’, calls for clarity on the need for nuclear power in the UK’s energy mix and commitment from government and industry to invest in new reactors. It says the UK’s planned nuclear new build programme offers a significant opportunity for the UK supply chain to demonstrate its capability and benefit economically. The government estimates investment of more than £45bn (€50bn, $59bn) will be needed to develop the first three nuclear power stations at Hinkley Point C, Wylfa Newydd and Moorside, where there are plans for a total of seven units across the three sites. The potential for new opportunities, such as small modular reactors, provides an opportunity to increase the skills and capacity of the UK nuclear supply chain, the report says. The report, which is built on interviews with members of the nuclear industry, highlights that international suppliers possess comparatively larger financial backing in the form of stronger balance sheets than UK suppliers. As a result, the UK supply chain is in a less favourable position to absorb the risk required to innovate and grow. “Innovation is sometimes seen as a risk within the sector and this is at a time when the UK must adopt leadership in innovation through the government’s industrial strategy,” the report says.

The report, ‘Expanding Horizons: The Role for New Nuclear in the UK’s Energy Mix’, argues that new nuclear should be central to the UK’s long-term energy strategy. Nuclear currently meets 45% of the UK’s low-carbon electricity and the power generated by the current nuclear fleet avoids the emission of 49 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, ResPublica said. The report says Britain’s new nuclear programme is necessary to meet the country’s medium and long-term ambitions for energy security and decarbonisation. No new reactors have been built in the UK almost three decades and much of the current electricity capacity will close by 2030. “Sustained political will and commitment is needed in the coming years to push new nuclear projects over the line,” the report says. The report also says new nuclear should not be offered as an alternative to renewables. Earlier this year over half of electricity generation was met from low-carbon sources comprised of nuclear and renewables, making nuclear a resource of huge potential as the UK strives to meet legally binding carbon targets. New nuclear is also a key source for UK innovation with enormous potential for nascent technology such as small modular reactors, the report says."

Greg Clark, the business secretary, is keen to put the UK at the forefront of technology seen as a more affordable alternative to large-scale nuclear reactors such as those under construction at the £20bn (€22bn, $26bn) Hinkley Point C nuclear station in southwest England, the newspaper said. It said development of SMRs is regarded as crucial to the future of the nuclear industry as it finds ways to remain competitive against the falling cost of renewable wind and solar power. The UK faces competition from the US, Canada and China in its effort to establish a leading position in SMR technology. In September 2017 media reports said industry players including Rolls-Royce, NuScale, Hitachi and Westinghouse had held meetings with civil servants about nuclear strategy and the development of SMRs. In a report published on 12 September 2017, Rolls-Royce said SMRs could produce energy for as low as £60 per MWh, which is competitive against wind and solar and significantly lower than the £92.50 per MWh agreed by the government and project developer EDF for Hinkley Point C. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the London-based Nuclear Industry Association , said with a potential global market for SMRs valued at £250bn-£400bn, the government must provide clarity if the energy, industrial and export opportunities of a UK SMR are to be realised."

            "19 Oct (NucNet): If the US wants to renew its leadership in nuclear technology and exports it needs to invest in a range of small modular reactor (SMR) technologies and help them reach commercial deployment, a study says. The Nuclear Innovation Alliance study, ‘Enabling Nuclear Innovation: Leading on Small Modular Reactors,’ says rebuilding the dominant position the US once held as the leading exporter of nuclear power plants could create hundreds of thousands of American jobs. It adds that a significant construction programme of SMRs in the near future is achievable if a combination of sensible state and federal policies is enacted. “The US should invest in a portfolio of reactor technologies and provide a continuum of support through the different stages of development using the market to guide technology down-selection,” the report says. The study recommends a blend of federal and state policy solutions including expanding the US Department of Energy cost-sharing programme with the private sector to accelerate SMR licensing and deployment. The study also highlights SMRs’ ability to complement intermittent renewables through their ability to “load-follow,” or ramp power up and down to follow daily fluctuations in electricity demand. This means SMRs could fill a role similar to natural gas plants on the grid, but without generating emissions. The Nuclear Innovation Alliance is made up of companies, investors, experts and stakeholders seeking to advance nuclear energy innovation and enable reactor commercialisation.

            "19 Oct (NucNet): Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) has received responses from 80 organisations following a request for expressions of interest on small modular reactors (SMRs) – a global response that shows “strong interest” in advancing the technology. CNL said in a report published on 18 October 2017 that the responses included 19 expressions of interest in siting a prototype or demonstration SMR at a CNL campus. CNL launched the request this summer to gather feedback on the potential for an SMR industry in Canada and the role CNL can play in bringing SMR technology to market. The report, ‘Perspectives on Canada’s SMR Opportunity’, summarises the responses, which came from SMR technology developers, potential end users, host communities, supply chain companies and academic institutions. The report says that while submissions came from a variety of organisations, there were areas of general agreement, including the positive economic benefits to Canada, alignment with Canada’s commitment to fight climate change, important applications for remote communities, and the potential to improve nuclear safety through next-generation nuclear technology. A number of responses indicated interest in integrating SMRs as part of a more diverse energy strategy, with applications as varied as district heating, co-generation, energy storage, desalination, or hydrogen production.

            "5 Oct (NucNet): US-based nuclear equipment manufacturer Westinghouse Electric Company has called on European Union legislators to adopt a technology-neutral approach when discussing the future of the bloc’s low-carbon energy policies.  ",
            "In its ‘Clean Energy for All Europeans’ legislative package, released in November 2016, the European Commission made no mention of nuclear energy, said Michael Kirst, Westinghouse’s vice-president of strategy for the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region at a media briefing in Brussels. He said the package did not offer “a real investment signal” to developers. The EC said the legislative package aims to improve the functioning of the European energy market, increase energy efficiency across the EU, achieve European “global leadership” in renewable energy and innovation, and provide a “fair deal” for consumers. “We are a bit surprised how nuclear is treated”, Luc Van Hulle, the company’s president for EMEA said.  Mr Van Hulle said Westinghouse believes greenhouse-emission and energy efficiency targets should be set by legislation, but types of technology to be used in achieving those targets should not be specified. This approach inhibits technology innovation, he said. He called for legislation to be created to ensure nuclear is considered among all low-carbon energy sources. Mr Kirst said there is a need for reliable, baseload low-carbon power and in this respect the combination between nuclear and renewables is a “very good one”. Nuclear power units have an average availability of 85-90% and can be operated in a flexible manner when needed to ensure grid stability and security of supply, he noted.Renewables, however, need back-up power because of their average intermittent availability of only about 30%. If this back-up power came from gas or coal, then the growth of renewables could ironically lead to the use of more fossil sources, he said. “Some people have convinced themselves that we can move to an all-renewables system and do without nuclear. And maybe someday we could, but today the technologies simply don’t allow that”, Mr Kirst said.He said utility-sized energy storage technology, which could potentially cause a “paradigm shift”, has not been developed yet. “Today it gets up to about a 100MW or so and is extremely expensive”, he said.  As part of its criticism of the proposed clean energy package, Westinghouse also said EU legislators did not consider “the totality of system costs” for each source of energy. Overall costs extend beyond the usual generation costs and include system costs such as back-up fuel and ETS (emission trading system) costs, taxes and policy support costs, and network costs like grid losses, grid modification, transmission disturbance and maintenance costs. Mr Kirst said Westinghouse sees sense in a market system that uses auctions for future power development, but such a system takes into account only marginal costs of power generation. “So what we are suggesting is if they are going to implement an auction format and capacity markets, let’s take a look at the total systems cost, because that is what the end consumer is going to pay for”, Mr Kirst said.The approach to system costs needs an open and honest debate in a “once-in-a-generation energy reform package”, Mr Kirst added.He said Westinghouse has not found the EC very supportive on the topic, but is involved in the parliamentary consultation process related to the clean energy package.Mr Van Hulle said policymakers need to be careful about striking a balance between renewables and nuclear in the power mix, but considering the total picture of costs, there is “a sound basis for nuclear going forward”.  Westinghouse says renewables and nuclear are both capital intensive energy options, with the largest bulk of the cost being paid up-front. Nuclear’s scale is much larger, but so is the energy output it generates“Energy should be a long-term vision. I understand that nuclear has a very high capital cost to start with. But if there is a long term vision, these are plants which are going to run for 60 years on an energy source which is extremely secure”, Mr Van Hulle said.Foratom, the Brussels-based trade association for the nuclear industry in Europe, said in a position paper earlier this year that the clean energy package could ensure a coherent approach towards meeting energy and climate objectives, provided the EC takes into account the views of the nuclear energy industry. The position paper said the goal of the EU to decarbonise the economy by more than 80% by 2050 cannot be achieved without nuclear power and called for an effective power market leading to competitive and affordable electricity prices for end-users and the promotion of investments in low-carbon technologies.The European nuclear industry has been calling for some time on the EC to propose a new energy market design that facilitates investments in all low-carbon energy sources including nuclear.In its recent Energy Technology Perspectives 2017 report, the Paris-based International Energy Agency argued that the sanctioning of new low-carbon generation has stalled because expected generation from wind and solar capacity has been almost entirely offset by the slowdown in nuclear and hydropower investment decisions, which declined by more than 50% over the last five years.The report speaks of the need for “strong policy signals” and “multiple policy objectives”. But for the nuclear sector, it says little about what these signals and objectives should be.Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy protection in the US in March 2017 to shelter its core businesses and give time to restructure for continuing operation. The company had been troubled by significant cost overruns on construction of AP1000 reactors at the Vogtle and Summer nuclear power stations. Company president and chief executive officer José Gutiérrez said the problems that led to the Chapter 11 filing had nothing to do with the company’s AP1000 reactor technology and that AP1000 reactors being built in China are proceeding well. Last month Westinghouse said it remained committed to developing a 225-MW small modular reactor in the UK. Details of the clean energy package are online: http://bit.ly/2gId2Q"

            "29 Sep (NucNet): Small modular reactors (SMRs) could rival the costs of natural gas plants if the risks typically facing new technologies are properly addressed, says a study by US-based SMR Start, the consortium of SMR developers and potential customers formed in January 2016 to help commercialise small reactor technologies. “There are many conditions and scenarios that could occur that would result in SMRs being comparable with the costs of a natural gas combined cycle plant,” the study, ‘Economics of Small Modular Reactors,’ says. “The first SMRs are expected to be within the range of natural gas plants costs assuming appropriate private-public partnerships to help reduce technology risks and keep first-of-a-kind costs low.” The study evaluates market opportunities, commercialisation time frames and cost competitiveness for SMRs. It also assesses various policy tools to help “first movers” overcome the costs of first-of-a-kind technology, including production tax credits, investment tax credits, loan guarantees, power purchase agreements and other policy tools. The study says SMRs will be needed as large retirements of baseload generation and an increase in intermittent renewables have negative impacts on the grid. Private companies continue to invest in SMRs – more than $1bn (€840m) so far – with the pace of development accelerated by support from the US Department of Energy. The first SMR licensing applications – by NuScale Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority – have been accepted for review by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with the first approval expected in the early-2020s.

            "28 Sep (NucNet): Westinghouse Electric Company said today it remains committed to developing a 225-MW small modular reactor (SMR) that the company believes will allow the UK to move from buyer to global provider of SMR technology. The company said in a statement that more than 85% of its SMR’s design, licence and procurement scope can be delivered by the UK. The fuel would be manufactured at its Springfields facility in northern England. “This is a special offering that only Westinghouse, with UK partners, can deliver,” the statement said. The Generation III+ Westinghouse SMR design benefits from sharing platforms, systems, and processes with the Westinghouse AP1000 reactor technology. The AP1000 reactor design completed the UK generic design assessment (GDA) in March 2017, resulting in a fully licensed plant ready for UK deployment. Rolls-Royce said in a report last week that SMR projects could deliver electricity for a similar cost to offshore wind. Rolls-Royce and its consortium partners, including Amec Foster Wheeler, Arup, Laing O’Rourke and Nuvia, say the UK SMR they are developing could produce energy for as low as £60 (€66, $79) per MWh, which is competitive against wind and solar and significantly lower than the £92.50 per MWh agreed by the government and project developer EDF for the new Hinkley Point C nuclear station.  Media reports in the UK have suggested that ministers are ready to approve the development of a fleet of SMRs to help guard against electricity shortages as older nuclear power stations are decommissioned. Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy protection in the US March 2017, citing costs from the Summer and Vogtle nuclear projects in the US.

            "25 Sep (NucNet): The UK nuclear industry is hoping that claims by Rolls-Royce that small modular reactor (SMR) projects could deliver electricity for a similar cost to offshore wind will provide much-needed impetus to government plans for the country to develop a “best value” SMR and put it into commercial operation by the end of the next decade.  ",
            "Rolls-Royce and its consortium partners, including Amec Foster Wheeler, Arup, Laing O’Rourke and Nuvia, say the UK SMR they are developing could produce energy for as low as £60 (€66, $79) per MWh, which is competitive against wind and solar and significantly lower than the £92.50 per MWh agreed by the government and project developer EDF for the new Hinkley Point C nuclear station. According to Rolls-Royce, the capital cost of the UK SMR can be reduced from a first-of-a-kind (FOAK) baseline to Nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) over a relatively short period of time, perhaps as little as eight years. This is less than the time required to construct a single large reactor such as the EPRs planned for Hinkley Point in Somerset. The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) generated by a FOAK UK SMR power station is forecast under £75 per MWh, but this reduces to a forecast £65 per MWh by station number five. In the medium term the target is even lower at £60 per MWh. The Rolls-Royce cost estimates were a boost for the nuclear industry, coming days after it emerged that offshore wind has fallen in cost over the past few years with a recent UK government auction for subsidy contracts awarding offshore wind projects due to generate power in 2021-22 contracts at £74.75 per MWh, while those set to generate in 2022-23 were awarded contracts for £57.50 per MWh. That price is half of what new offshore windfarms were being awarded just two years ago. However, Rolls-Royce also warned in its report that the government needs to “move forward with pace” towards establishing the conditions required for a UK SMR to flourish. The rest of the world continues to develop SMR technology and the UK is in danger of being left behind. A key role for government is to provide a fertile “ecosystem” for UK SMR development, starting with policies and support for an indigenous UK SMR market.In 2016 the government launched the first phase of a £250m SMR competition to choose the best design of SMR for the UK, but the second stage of the competition – with design proposals chosen for funding – has not yet materialised. The competition followed an announcement in 2015 when the then chancellor George Osborne promised £250m over five years for a nuclear research and development programme, an undisclosed sum of which was for a competition to pave the way for SMRs.Sources confirmed that officials from the Department for Business were whittling down proposals from various consortia, including Rolls-Royce, keen to work with the government to develop SMRs. The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on 9 September 2017 that ministers are ready to approve the development of a fleet of SMRs. Industry players including Rolls-Royce, NuScale, Hitachi and Westinghouse have held meetings in past weeks with civil servants about nuclear strategy and development of SMRs, the newspaper said. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the London-based Nuclear Industry Association, said with a potential global market for SMRs valued at £250bn-£400bn, the government must provide clarity if the energy, industrial and export opportunities of a UK SMR are to be realised.The appeal of SMR designs is that because of their small size, 300 MW or less, they are economic, factory built and shippable, flexible enough to desalinate, refine oil, load-follow wind, and produce hydrogen. And they seek to address the basic economic challenges that larger plants have struggled to overcome in recent years. Those challenges include reducing the overall capital cost, which would allow for conventional project financing; improved certainty of construction, manufacture and project delivery; and a competitive LCOE.Energy analyst James Conca, writing in Forbes magazine, identifies another key advantage of SMRs. The small size and large surface area-to-volume ratio of SMRs, like the one being developed by NuScale Power, that sits below ground in a super seismic-resistant heat sink, allows natural processes to cool it indefinitely in the case of a complete power blackout, with no humans needed to intervene, no AC or DC power, no pumps, and no additional water for cooling. Rolls-Royce says SMRs are attractive because they can produce large savings for a relatively small investment. They avoid the complex challenges associated with nuclear mega-projects that require tens of billions of pounds of investment to progress – and have a general track record of overspend and delay. By reducing plant size, and therefore capital costs, SMRs can be financed via conventional project approaches, with financing limited to under £2.5bn. This reduced funding increases the number of utilities and operating companies that could potentially afford to invest in a new nuclear power station.Once the initial design is licensed, parts can be made on a factory production line relatively cheaply. Rolls-Royce sees SMRs as complementary to the large reactor programme, rather than a replacement. SMRs will strengthen the UK’s energy security by reducing reliance on foreign gas imports and smoothing out the impact of intermittent generation technologies such as wind and solar. The Roll-Royce study, entitled ‘UK SMR: A National Endeavour’, urges ministers to support the development of British-manufactured SMRs, which could create 40,000 skilled jobs, contribute £100bn to the economy and open up a £400bn export market. The report argues that a UK SMR programme would avoid the complexities, delays and overspends often associated with infrastructure projects. There are multiple large new reactors under construction around the world – 57 according to the most recent figures from the International Atomic Energy Agency. However, many have experienced delays during construction including plants in Finland, France, the US, and the UK. The additional cost of borrowing incurred by these delays runs to billions of pounds, often underwritten by loan guarantees from national governments. Rolls-Royce says the reduced size of SMR power plants and their relative flexibility present “a clear opportunity” with innovation in how the systems, components and buildings are conceived and arranged leading to improvements in construction certainty and security, lower total costs and confidence in delivery. Current construction techniques for large nuclear plants rely heavily on site-specific labour, with many thousands of workers required to be engaged in constructing the power station in-situ. In addition, a modern, large nuclear power station construction site presents complex project management challenges, with multiple build activities taking place simultaneously across a vast area of land within a strict security, health and safety regime. If this were not complex enough, simple tasks such as lifting and manoeuvring heavy components can be delayed by days or weeks due to adverse weather conditions such as wind, rain and snow.In response to this, the UK SMR design team says it has sought to significantly reduce the amount of onsite construction required by adopting modern design principles such as modularity, standardisation and commoditisation. Moving activities offsite into controlled factory environments allows operations to continue unabated during bad weather, with security, quality and health and safety more readily controlled. “Improving the certainty of construction, manufacture and overall project delivery is key to realising the promise of SMRs”, Rolls-Royce said.Once the technology has been chosen and the development funded and underway, the government must identify multiple sites across the UK to enable large-scale fleet deployment. The UK SMR must progress efficiently through the UK regulator’s generic design assessment (GDA), with the government sponsoring a suitably timely “slot” with the UK regulatory authorities.  A significant barrier to nuclear innovation in the UK is lack of regulatory capacity. Nuclear regulation in the UK is, rightly, strict and extensive. A generic design assessment (GDA) takes up to five years, and costs developers at least £35m in regulatory fees alone. The total cost, including costs of preparing all the documentation, is more than double this. However, once the GDA is complete, Rolls-Royce believes the UK SMR becomes a viable proposition for independent private investment. Up until that point, government support will be needed to sustain the design development programme. The cost of this will be around £500m matched against industry funding. Mr Tindale said the funding announced in the 2015 autumn budget statement should be allocated to possible reactors based on how well each reactor scores against a series of criteria: safety, cost, waste management, proliferation resistance, design experience, reactor flexibility, use of spent fuel/plutonium, and heat/hydrogen production. “The £250 million, over a period of five years, could deliver substantial progress towards these potential benefits of nuclear power – as long as it is sensibly spent,” he said.Mr Tindale urged the UK government to spread its spending of the £250m across SMRs, larger Generation IV reactors – which could be considerably cheaper than existing nuclear designs due to less complex designs – and ‘micro-reactors’ of under 20MW. These “plug and play” reactors offer even more flexibility than SMRs for supplying power and heat to isolated locations and energy intensive industry. A cost impact study by Ernst & Young suggests that the case for SMRs looks compelling. In a report published 12 months after the March 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi accident, the company said SMRs require less up-front capital than large-scale plants, and the modular design allows units to be deployed incrementally, so cash generated from the electricity sales of the first operational units can offset the negative cash flows of subsequent unit construction. According to the UK’s National Nuclear Laboratory, it is clear that the capital investment required for new nuclear build in the UK is challenging. The ability to raise several billions of pounds for a twin unit – Hinkley Point C, for example – is only possible by a few utilities in Europe and has seen the formation of consortia in the UK to look to address this issue. The major advantage that SMRs have regarding capital expenditure is that more operators and/or investors can consider a nuclear programme. With a cumulative cash flow for a fleet of SMRs being a fraction of that of large nuclear plants due to less capital outlay per unit, faster construction time and staggered build are possible – when one module is finished and starts producing electricity, it will generate positive cash flow for the next module to be built.There are a substantial number of SMR concepts and designs at various stages of development. Some are being developed by universities as pure research and teaching projects, others by private investors looking to break into the new build market and several by the large international reactor vendors.  Apart from Rolls-Royce, designs are being developed by Westinghouse, Urenco, NuScale, China National Nuclear Corporation, Moltex Energy and GF Nuclear. All these are said to be part of the UK competition, although this has not been confirmed.Westinghouse has one of the most mature designs, making heavy use of technology derived from its AP1000 full-sized PWR, which completed its GDA process in March 2017 and is planned for the UK’s Moorside site. At 225MW, it’s one of the larger designs.Westinghouse moved early to establish a strong potential UK supply chain – the company has signed agreements with the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (NAMRC) of Sheffield University, and through that is already collaborating with companies like Sheffield Forgemasters. The design uses the same fuel as the AP1000, which will be manufactured at Springfields, near Preston.Westinghouse said it will continue to work with the NAMRC on an additional advanced manufacturing study aimed at significantly reducing the build lead-times of its SMR, a decision which shows its commitment to “partnering with the UK government to deploy the company’s SMR technology”. Meanwhile, in the UK, all eyes are on the government. A House of Lords committee warned that failure to so far deliver on the competition to develop SMRs has hurt the nuclear sector and risks international companies walking away from the UK. “This has had a negative effect on the nuclear sector in the UK and if the government does not act soon the necessary high level of industrial interest will not be maintained,” they said.The Rolls-Royce report is online: http://bit.ly/2woHjuf"

Offshore wind has fallen in cost over the past few years with a government auction for subsidy contracts this week awarding offshore wind projects due to generate power in 2021-22 contracts at £74.75 per MWh, while those set to generate in 2022-23 were awarded contracts for £57.50 per MWh. That price is half of what new offshore windfarms were being awarded just two years ago. The Rolls Royce report is online: http://bit.ly/2woHjuf"

            "11 Sep (NucNet): Ministers in the UK are ready to approve the development of a fleet of small modular reactors (SMRs) to help guard against electricity shortages as older nuclear power stations are decommissioned, the Daily Telegraph reported on 9 September 2017. The report said the new technology is expected to offer energy a third cheaper than conventional reactors such as the EPR units planned for the Hinkley Point C nuclear station in Somerset, England. Industry players including Rolls-Royce, NuScale, Hitachi and Westinghouse have held meetings in past weeks with civil servants about nuclear strategy and development of SMRs, the newspaper said. It added that a report to be published by Rolls-Royce this week claims its consortium can generate electricity at a “strike price” – the guaranteed price producers can charge – of £60/MWh (€66, $79), two thirds that of recent large-scale nuclear plants. Sources confirmed that officials from the Department for Business were whittling down proposals from consortia keen to work with government to develop SMRs, with an announcement on the final contenders for funding expected soon. In May 2017 the UK nuclear energy industry said it was frustrated that the first stage of the government’s SMR competition had been left hanging in the air and that the roadmap the industry was promised last autumn “seems to have got lost somewhere in Whitehall”. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the London-based Nuclear Industry Association , said with a potential global market for SMRs valued at £250bn-£400bn, the government must provide clarity if the energy, industrial and export opportunities of a UK SMR are to be realised."

The CNA said in a statement on 7 September 2017 that the IPCC should recognise the solutions that nuclear technologies provide to the avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions, support the role nuclear plays in enabling intermittent renewable options, and highlight the potential role it offers to the world in generating large quantities of clean energy to meet the COP21 climate targets. The CNA said Canada’s nuclear industry can help contribute to affordable and clean energy around the world with its Candu reactor technology. The industry's investments in innovative nuclear technology include small modular reactors (SMRs) which will have the capacity to provide “a clean source of energy to remote communities, resource extraction sites and provincial electricity grids”, the CNA said."

The technology “significantly” improves the economics and safety of nuclear power, “operating  about 1000°C cooler than conventional fuel”, Lightbridge said. In November 2016, Lightbridge and Areva reached an agreement on the key terms for the creation of the new joint venture, including equal-share ownership. The venture will cover fuel assemblies for most types of light-water reactors, including pressurised water reactors (PWRs), boiling water reactors (BWRs), small modular reactors (SMRs) and research reactors.

            "7 Sep (NucNet): US-based small modular reactor (SMR) developer NuScale Power has announced the start of an action plan for the deployment of SMR technology in the UK in the 2020s. NuScale said in a statement that the plan outlines how the company’s “multi-billion pound” UK SMR venture could involve UK companies, which are to provide more than 85% of the content required for deployment in the UK. “ Our UK SMR action plan sets out a clear vision for NuScale’s technology to be rolling off production lines in UK factories, generating power for UK homes in the 2020s and transforming the UK into a hub for export into a lucrative global market”, Tom Mundy, NuScale’s managing director for UK and Europe, was quoted in the statement as saying. Last month, Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the UK Nuclear Industry Association, said that with a potential global market for SMRs valued at as much as £400 bn (€440bn, $520bn), the government must provide clarity as soon as possible if the energy, industrial and export opportunities of a UK SMR are to be realised. In March 2016, the UK government announced a competition to identify the “best value” SMR in the UK – paving the way for the country to build one of the world’s first SMRs. NuScale said its UK action plan comes after the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission accepted its SMR design certification application in March 2017. NuScale expects regulatory approval in the US to be granted in the early 2020s, leading to an initial deployment of an SMR at a site in Idaho by the mid-2020s. NuScale was the first company to submit an SMR design for certification in the US. According to earlier statements by NuScale, its SMR technology includes scalable plants, and the facility output can be incrementally increased depending on demand. The technology’s operational flexibility can be integrated with other energy sources like wind and solar to provide consistent power and to help enable stable grid performance."

Companies including NuScale, Rolls-Royce, Hitachi and Westinghouse have been summoned by ministers in a bid to reignite interest in the UK’s SMR project. They have been asked to present their plans in meetings over the next few weeks. SMRs are a fraction of the size and cost of conventional nuclear power stations such as EDF’s Hinkley Point C project. Two years ago the government launched a competition for SMRs but has not kept to its timetable. A House of Lords report in May 2017 said this has had a negative effect on the nuclear sector in the UK and if the government does not act soon the necessary high level of industrial interest will not be maintained. The London-based Nuclear Industry Association said it was frustrated that the first stage of the SMR competition had been left hanging in the air, and that the roadmap industry was promised “seems to have got lost somewhere in Whitehall”. Tom Greatrex, the NIA’s chief executive, said with a potential global market for SMRs valued at as much as £400bn (€440bn, $519bn), the government must provide clarity as soon as possible if the energy, industrial and export opportunities of a UK SMR are to be realised. “Otherwise, that promising opportunity of recent years will be lost to others, including the US, Canada and China, who are progressing with SMR development,” he said. The Daily Telegraph said companies considering investments in SMR technology had hoped that ministers would indicate which proposals they would support months ago, but they received no communication, fuelling the speculation that SMRs were being quietly abandoned."

            "4 Jul (NucNet): Traditional nuclear power projects delivering baseload electricity will have to adapt if nuclear is to have a significant role in a future UK low carbon energy system, according to the UK’s Energy Technologies Institute (ETI), which has released a series of project reports into nuclear energy from its research portfolio. Analysis carried out by the ETI has shown that new nuclear plants can form a major part of an affordable low carbon transition in the UK with potential roles for both large nuclear and small modular reactors (SMRs). Large reactors are best suited for baseload electricity production, but actual deployment will be influenced by a number of factors – not all of them technical – and SMRs could fulfil an additional role in a UK low carbon energy system by delivering combined heat and power helping to decarbonise energy use in buildings. However, the nuclear industry has to clearly “articulate its role in a changing energy system and also demonstrate realistic cost reduction in the development of nuclear power generation”, the ETI said. Mike Middleton, strategy manager for the ETI’s nuclear programme, said the UK benefits from an established knowledge base and supply chain in nuclear power plant operations, but there is competition for nuclear to prove itself economically against other low-carbon options.

Asked about problems at the Vogtle and Summer new-build projects, which have been affected by reactor supplier Westinghouse applying for bankruptcy protection, Mr Perry said “this is a massively important issue for the security of America and the security for America's allies”. Mr Perry said the US needed a plan to remain engaged in the development of nuclear energy.  He said “one of the things we want to do at DOE is to make nuclear energy cool again”.

The spending plan requests a total of $28bn for the US Department of Energy.  Included in that $28bn total, the administration is requesting $703m (€628) for the DOE’s nuclear energy programme, which is 28.7% or $283m below the $986m the programme received in fiscal 2016. In a response to the proposal on 24 May 2017, Ms Korsnick, said this was not enough and “now is not the time to back away from federal investment that has played such a pivotal role in making the US a world leader in nuclear technology”. She said: “There is a shrinking window of time to re-establish international leadership before the United States is completely eclipsed by our strategic competitors.” Funding for nuclear research is fundamental, she said. Ms Korsnick called on the US government to prioritise investment in nuclear innovation. She said exports of advanced reactor designs would create tens of thousands more American jobs and ensure security while improving infrastructure.  Ms Korsnick said the NEI is encouraged that the budget requests funding for the federal government to honour its commitment to dispose of used nuclear fuel. She said the companies operating the US’s nuclear power plants have paid tens of billions of dollars to the federal government in return for a commitment that the used fuel from those plants would be removed for disposal starting in 1998. “That promise has been broken time and again,” she said. Ms Korsnick commended the administration for its support for resuming the Yucca Mountain deep geologic repository project.She said the NEI was discouraged by the budget’s lack of support for programmes that help sustain the US’s 99 commercial reactors. Crucial programmes at the US Department of Energy include light-water reactor sustainability and accident tolerant fuels. Continued DOE support is crucial at a time when US companies developing small modular reactors find themselves in an uphill battle against foreign competitors."

The 17 Republicans urged Mr Trump to “help reestablish the United States as the world leader” in the development of advanced nuclear reactor technology and to recognise that other countries also are developing SMR concepts with the intention of dominating the international market. “We know foreign nuclear programmes are largely backed by their respective governments, and thus US private sector nuclear technology development has a significant competitive disadvantage,” the letter said.

The report also outlines possible routes the government could take to leaving the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) regarding issues such as safeguards, nuclear cooperation agreements, research and development, and regulation. The IME is calling for the UK to develop its own safeguarding office, to ensure the country conforms to international rules on safety and non-proliferation, but says the UK should remain an associate member of Euratom for the specific purpose of R&D. Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment for the IME and lead author of the report, said in a 5 May 2017 statement that the UK’s departure from the EU and Euratom is likely to be “complicated and difficult”, but it also presents the country with an opportunity to “reshape its nuclear industry and once again become a world-leading innovator in nuclear technology”."

            "5 May (NucNet): The US nuclear industry has called for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s “outdated and costly” regulatory regime to be updated. In testimony to the House appropriations committee’s energy and water development subcommittee on 3 May 2017, Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute president and chief executive officer Maria Korsnick said the need for Congressional action on regulatory reform has become more urgent as utilities consider using accident tolerant fuel and NRC applications are being submitted for certification of small modular reactor designs, which will be deployed in the mid-2020s. She said developers of advanced non-light-water reactors are beginning to deal with the NRC as they look to deploy their technologies around 2030. Ms Korsnick also called for licensing the proposed Yucca Mountain deep geologic repository and construction of a consolidated interim storage facility. She said the industry wanted an urgent review of accident tolerant fuel and advanced reactor programmes, and funding for federal research and development efforts that promote new technologies and innovation.

            "4 May (NucNet): Westinghouse is committed to its Generation III+ AP1000 reactor technology and will continue existing projects to build units at Sanmen and Haiyang in China, the company told NucNet in an email on 3 May 2017. The first AP1000 units at Sanmen and Haiyang are “moving into the final stage of fuel loading” and the first Sanmen unit is on track to begin commercial operation by the end of 2017, a spokesperson said. There are two AP1000s under construction at each site. The spokesperson said the company will continue to pursue other potential AP1000 projects because they will be structured in a manner that does not include construction risk. Westinghouse, the US-based nuclear unit of Japan’s Toshiba, filed for bankruptcy protection in the US in March. The spokesperson said this was because of a write-down related to the increased estimated cost to complete its US AP1000 projects at Vogtle in Georgia Summer in South Carolina, where there are two AP1000s under construction at each site. Asked about plans to build six AP1000s in Andhra Pradesh, India, the spokesperson said: “We continue to pursue the India bids as they were structured in a manner that does not include construction risk.” The spokesperson said Westinghouse will continue to cooperate with the UK on the development and eventual deployment of a small modular reactor. “We believe there is great value in the Westinghouse SMR, which applies the AP1000 plant safety technology into a 200 MW-class reactor.”"

            "2 May (NucNet): The UK nuclear energy industry shares the frustration of a House of Lords committee that the first stage of the government’s small modular reactor (SMR) competition has been left hanging in the air, and that the roadmap industry was promised last autumn “seems to have got lost somewhere in Whitehall”. Commenting on the House of Lords science and technology committee report, Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the London-based Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), said with a potential global market for SMRs valued at £250bn-£400bn, the government must provide clarity as soon as possible after the general election in June 2017 if the energy, industrial and export opportunities of a UK SMR are to be realised. “Otherwise, that promising opportunity of recent years will be lost to others, including the US, Canada and China, who are progressing with SMR development programmes,” he said. The committee said it is disappointed that the government launched a competition for SMRs and has not kept to its timetable. This has had a negative effect on the nuclear sector in the UK and if the government does not act soon the necessary high level of industrial interest will not be maintained. “It is particularly alarming that the results of phase one of the competition, which does not involve the selection of an SMR design, have yet to be announced by the government,” the committee said.

            "24 Apr (NucNet): There is a serious risk that new nuclear reactors may not be built in time to even replace the existing capacity of nuclear generation in the UK, although an alternative route could be offered by small modular reactors (SMRs), the UK engineering profession said in a report on 24 April 2017. In its feedback on the government’s industrial strategy, which was published in January 2017, the Royal Academy of Engineering said the smaller size and modular design of SMEs could offer much lower capital hurdles and shorter delivery times, and small reactors have operated for years in certain applications such as nuclear submarines. However, commercial civil reactors are yet to be developed and there is “much work needed before they reach market, not least in terms of safety regulations”. The academy said the commercial risks are high but the UK has expertise in this field and the potential rewards both in terms of the energy transition and financial returns are large. According to the academy, the UK’s nuclear energy industry struggles with an ageing workforce and relies on imported reactor designs, which is a lost opportunity for the UK’s historically strong engineering and design capacity in this field. In addition, the new-build programme is also not progressing as expected, with few global vendors, most of whom are struggling to finance the extremely high capital costs of the latest generation of reactors.  The academy said there is an opportunity for the UK supply chain to play a part in the development of SMRs. However, this will probably need some form of “catalytic activity” from government and a clearer focus from the industry on commercially viable solutions. “The UK could use its history of reactor development and international reputation for safety and quality to develop and promulgate UK participation in technology for a worldwide market,” the academy said.

A regulatory basis is an early stage in the rulemaking process in which the NRC explains the rationale for developing new regulatory requirements and seeks input from the public. After the regulatory basis is finalised, the NRC will develop a proposed rule, which will also be issued for public comment. The draft regulatory basis explains why the NRC believes existing regulations should be updated. The NRC said the nuclear power industry is developing SMRs and other advanced reactor technologies that differ in size, scope and hazard from the large light-water reactors operating in the US today. Their smaller size or innovative safety features are likely to lead to lower risk or less challenging accident conditions than today’s reactors. This rulemaking would establish emergency preparedness requirements appropriate to these technologies, the NRC said. Details online: http://bit.ly/2oKE2ol"

            "29 Mar (NucNet): South Africa’s state utility and nuclear operator Eskom has started looking again at plans abandoned in 2010 to develop a Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR), the company’s chief nuclear officer David Nicholls said. In an interview with EE Publishers, Mr Nicholls said Eskom is looking at whether there is a market for ultra-safe, small, nuclear reactors for power generation, using high-temperature technology. He said Eskom had started looking at the PBMR again with “a clean sheet” and is carrying out a paper study “with limited research funding going into it”. The PBMR was fundamentally designed in South Africa in the 1990s, based on German technology that was demonstrated in the 1970s and 80s. Mr Nicholls said the new work has been looking at what has changed since then, and how the PBMR design can be changed to take advantage of this. He said: “Probably the best example is 3D printing. We can now consider 3D printing the ceramic materials, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago. We are also considering the use of concrete pressure vessels instead of steel, which could reduce the price significantly”. The PBMR is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor with a closed-cycle, gas turbine power conversion system. The name “pebble bed” derives from the fact that the fuel would be fabricated into tiny particles, like grains of fine sand, called microspheres. The project was put on hold because of funding constraints. A planned demonstration plant would have supplied about 165 MWe to South Africa’s national grid once in service. The intention of the original project was to build up to 30 units in South Africa, after which the technology would have been deployed overseas. PBMR’s original investors were Eskom, the South African government, the Industrial Development Corporate of South Africa and the American nuclear company Westinghouse Electric Company.

Fluor said that by accepting the completed application for review, the NRC has confirmed that NuScale’s submission addresses all NRC requirements and contains sufficient technical information to carry out the review. If the review is successful, the reactor would be certified for use in the US and NuScale could apply for a construction and operating licence. The NRC said in a statement that NuScale submitted its application on 12 January 2017. The design is for a reactor building that holds 12 co-located pressurised-water reactor modules for a total output of 600 MW, the NRC said. NuScale is the first company to submit an SMR design for certification. NuScale said its SMR technology includes scalable plants, and the facility output can be incrementally increased depending on demand.

The commercialisation programme also includes the near-term goals of confirming projected construction and operating costs, as well as finding a lead-plant owner/operator for the reactor. GEH and ARC Nuclear have each developed advanced reactor designs based on the EBR-II, an integral sodium-cooled fast reactor prototype which was developed by Argonne National Laboratory and operated for more than 30 years at Idaho Falls, Idaho. Both designs share fundamental features, such as high energy neutrons, liquid sodium cooling and metallic fuel, which together deliver inherent safety performance and more economically competitive plant architecture compared to traditional water-cooled reactors. GEH said that while there are more than 90 advanced nuclear technology and SMR designs under various stages of development, GEH and ARC Nuclear view sodium fast reactors as being “the most mature advanced reactor technology with decades of real operating experience from more than 20 previous reactors”."

            "Paris-based engineering services company Assystem is working with EDF to prepare for construction of the UK’s first nuclear unit in more than 20 years. Christian Jeanneau, the company’s senior vice-president, nuclear, spoke to NucNet about what has been done so far and the need to learn lessons from other EPR projects.",
            "NucNet: Assystem will be collaborating with EDF to build two EPR reactors at Hinkley Point C. What form exactly will this collaboration take?Christian Jeanneau: We are supporting EDF in the design phase and we expect to continue this until the construction management and commissioning phases. We are using the experience and lessons we have learnt on the Flamanville-3 EPR in France. We will be providing engineering services such as systems engineering, project management and engineering studies. We have signed contracts to provide engineering services for some auxiliary buildings, the nuclear island, contract and project management support, safety and control systems, and the design of mechanical and electrical components. NucNet: Could you give us a general update on the work which is already under way by Assystem for the Hinkley Point C project. What are the next steps? CJ: We are following the project’s general roadmap. We have mostly been supporting the preparation of the project’s design. Next we will provide support for the contracting management of various components. Assystem has experience with the French PWR fleet, but has also had a presence in the UK for about 40 years with around 1,200 employees in various locations across the country. It is important for us to be seen as a local company, employing local people and bringing extensive PWR expertise to the UK. I think our understanding of the nuclear sectors both in France and the UK makes us confident in supporting the Hinkley Point C project and, in future, the proposed Sizewell project. NucNet: Assystem has experience with the construction of EPR reactors worldwide – in France (Flamanville), China (Taishan) and Finland (Olkiluoto). Do you expect any significant differences or challenges that will be specific to the Hinkley Point project? CJ: The specific challenges for our involvement with Hinkley Point C will come from the need to adapt the project to local regulations and requirements in the UK. For example, we have recently started work on preparing the analysis for fire hazards and other physical risks. This is an area where different regulations apply in the UK to France. We are working on these studies and projects and are adapting to local requirements.A significant element of Hinkley Point C is the new supply chain. There will be new companies taking part – some of them without any previous experience working with EPRs. It’s possible that for some of them, UK-specific regulations will present new challenges. One of the important tasks for Assystem will be to provide them with the necessary knowhow to ensure the quality of their services.NucNet: There have been delays at the Flamanville and Olkiluoto EPR projects. What do you think must be done to prevent similar delays at Hinkley?CJ: A huge and complex project will often face problems along its lifecycle, but there are reasons to be confident that Hinkley Point C will be delivered on time and within the original budget.The first reason is that EDF has the experience of previous projects on the supply chain side of things. Hinkley Point’s EPR will not be the first of its kind, despite being the first new nuclear plant in the UK for some time. The second reason is that there have been lessons learned on project management and quality control procedures, while many design issues have already been resolved during the preceding projects. The supply chain is now better prepared across every stage. Companies like Assystem have more than 10 years’ of experience with EPR projects internationally. NucNet: How can digital engineering improve the industrial performance of nuclear projects and what do you think the nuclear industry needs to do to improve its use of such technologies?CJ: Making a quick comparison with other sectors, I think that the aerospace industry may be a good benchmark. It includes large projects with similar duration to their counterparts in the nuclear field. Savings of about 30% of project costs have been estimated in the aerospace sector primarily due to the reduction of project duration. Returning to nuclear, when the construction phase begins a major part of the cost component is related to the timeline. The use of 3D modeling and product lifecycle management (PLM) tools has been instrumental in bringing these savings to projects in the aerospace industry.Some of this experience with digital tools acquired in other sectors could help nuclear projects. Of course, I can’t say at this stage that we can guarantee 30% savings for Hinkley Point C, but this has been feasible in other sectors. Getting to know the trends helps to better understand the supply chain from design to engineering and construction. Shortening project durations could be especially important in the nuclear industry.NucNet: Is Assystem going to be involved in the various stages of the licensing process?CJ: Yes. We are already working on studies and assessments of critical safety and security issues, including technical areas such as fire or electrical faults. All of this research and preparation will help EDF prepare the safety reports and will help streamline a substantial part of the licensing process.NucNet: Assystem is part of a joint venture that was this year awarded a contract to project manage the assembly of more than one million components for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or Iter, under construction in France. Can you outline the scope of this contract and give us an update on the status of the work.CJ: Iter is a very large research project aimed at proving the feasibility of fusion as a large-scale and carbon-free source of energy. It’s based on the same scientific principle that powers our sun and stars. It uses technology very differently from some of the areas we discussed before. There is fusion reactor experience in the UK – as well as prototype fusion reactors like the Joint European Torus, or Jet, in Oxfordshire – but never on this scale. We started our involvement with Iter at the very beginning of the project, with the design phase 12 years ago in 2005. From the outset we have been teaming up with various engineering companies from a number of different countries. In 2010 we were awarded a large buildings architect engineering contract through a joint venture known as Engage, which was created with our partners Egis, Empresarios Agrupados and Atkins. This contract covers all the buildings at the Iter site and will continue until 2019. We were recently awarded a second contract. It’s a 10-year contract in cooperation with Kepco E&C of South Korea and Amec Foster Wheeler from the UK through a joint venture called Momentum. As the construction management-as-agent (CMA), Momentum will be in charge of the project management of the assembly of more than one million components of the fusion reactor. NucNet: What is the significance for the nuclear sector of your recent acquisition of Batir Group? Was the acquisition driven mainly by your wish to be involved in the growth area of Building Information Modelling and digital mockups?CJ: The recent takeover of Batir is best understood as a ‘tech-bridge’ acquisition. BATIR is specialised in the construction, management and design of civil works in the nuclear sector. The company began in France to build digital information models encompassing the whole lifecycle of a project. We were particularly interested in their expertise in the efficient management of concrete – as I’m sure you know it counts for about 50% of the weight of any nuclear project. Our second motivation in our takeover of Batir was to expand and develop our digital engineering knowledge.NucNet: What other major projects is Assystem involved in?CJ: We are supporting NuGen in the early development phases of its AP1000 new-build project for the proposed Moorside project in the UK. In the Middle East, Assystem is one of the contributors to the United Arab Emirates’ nuclear programme, providing project management support to the future operation and maintenance phases of the nuclear station programme. We recently relocated the headquarters for our energy and infrastructure branch to Dubai and acquired in 2015 a local engineering company, Assystem-Radicon, in Saudi Arabia.Assystem is involved in the Turkish nuclear programme. There are three different projects at three different stages in Turkey. For both the Akkuyu and Sinop projects, our local subsidiary Assystem Envy delivers environmental and site studies. We are also playing a part in all EPR projects worldwide, in Finland, France, China and the UK. In 2016, we signed a memorandum of understanding with Russia’s Rosatom to allow us to support them in the development of their future nuclear projects. NucNet: Does Assystem have any involvement in the development of small modular reactors?CJ: to be considered an interesting complement to large reactors such as EPRs because of their siting flexibility, potential operational flexibility, grid stability and potential use of heat. Conceptual designs have been developed by a number of countries including the US, Japan, Russia, South Korea, China and France. We see an opportunity to collaborate with SMR developers and internally are already looking at ways we can contribute. "

            "10 Feb (NucNet): UK-based Ultra Electronics has successfully completed acceptance testing of the NuScale power module protection system it is developing for US small modular reactor (SMR) developer NuScale Power. The UK-developed system is a critical safety component and will be fundamental to the operation of NuScale’s SMR technology. Factory acceptance tests were carried out at Ultra’s facility in Dorset, southern England, earlier this month. The tests – witnessed by representatives from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) – successfully demonstrated the systems’ ability to handle safety-critical scenarios associated with the operation of NuScale’s SMR technology. The results of the tests will now form part of the NRC’s review of NuScale’s design certification application. In December 2016, NuScale asked the NRC to review and approve its commercial SMR plant design – the first SMR technology developer to do so. NuScale said the unit will be ready for manufacture and deployment in the US and the UK by the mid-2020s. The first plant has been earmarked for a site at the US Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory. At the heart of NuScale’s SMR technology is an integral reactor vessel surrounded by a high pressure steel containment, which when coupled to its power generation equipment can produce 50 MW of electricity. A NuScale power plant can house up to 12 of these modules for a total facility output of 600 MW (gross). NuScale said the scalability afforded by the modular design allows customers to incrementally increase facility output to match demand."

            "9 Feb (NucNet): Nuclear energy is one of the cheapest options for power generation when lifecycle costs are taken into account and will continue be part of the solution to climate change long into the future, a report by Lloyds Register says. The report, ‘Lloyd’s Register Technology Radar – The Nuclear Perspective’, says that in an atmosphere in which governments are committed to lowering their dependence on fossil fuels, nuclear is a key low-carbon option for baseload power generation. Although public acceptance is a major challenge in some countries, nuclear is likely to contribute to the energy mix “for the foreseeable future”. The potential contribution of small modular reactors, or SMRs, is unclear, the report says, although its impact will most likely apply to smaller grids and isolated markets. However, the underlying modularisation technology is expected to have a major impact on the sector.  Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are now reaching cost parity with their fossil fuel-based alternatives, but intermittency is a challenge that has yet to be solved, the report says. “While oversupply can to some extent be traded through regional grids, baseload power is still needed for when the wind fails to blow or the sun fails to shine.” The report is online: http://bit.ly/2kvix8I"

            "24 Jan (NucNet): UK government officials met over the summer with 32 eligible participants for phase one of the government’s small modular reactor (SMR) competition, which aims to gauge market interest in developing, commercialising and financing SMRs in the UK. The government said in responses to questions raised by parliament’s energy and climate change committee in an October 2016 report that the eligible participants included technology vendors, service providers and potential investors. The government said it is important to establish the commercial viability of SMRs. To gain a better understanding of this and other key aspects of SMR technologies, the government is drawing on the outcome of the phase one meetings, the expressions of interest documents submitted by applicants, the findings of a techno-economic assessment and its “continuing discussions with regulators”. The government said: “It is only through a robust evidence base that the potential benefits of SMRs can be accurately evaluated, and it is this evidence that is now shaping the government’s considerations for the future of the competition.” Details online: http://bit.ly/2j0avWi"

            "24 Jan (NucNet): There are acute and urgent skills shortages in key industrial sectors in the UK including the nuclear industry and a better system needs to be identified and fix emerging gaps, a government green paper, or preliminary report, says. The green paper on post-Brexit industrial strategy, published on 23 January 2017, says even if shortfalls in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) skills and technical education are addressed, shortages in the nuclear industry might remain. The government plans to set an “open door” challenge to industry to come to the government with proposals to transform and upgrade their sector through “sector deals”. These deals would be an open call to business to organise behind strong leadership to address shared challenges and opportunities. The green paper says Lord Hutton, a former defence secretary who is co-chair of the Nuclear Industry Council and chairman of the London-based Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), will oversee work to improve UK competitiveness and skills in nuclear. The NIA said in a statement that with plans in place for a new nuclear power programme, there is considerable opportunity for the supply chain across the UK. The UK is also at the forefront of the development of the next generation of nuclear – small modular reactors (SMRs). The statement said: “The NIA believes development of SMR technology could be an important part of ensuring the UK’s nuclear industry realises its full economic and industrial potential.” The green paper is online: http://bit.ly/2iVhRKG"

NuScale said in a statement on 12 January 2017 that it had asked the NRC to approve its SMR commercial power plant design. NuScale’s application consisted of nearly 12,000 pages of technical information. The NRC is expected to take 40 months to complete the review, NuScale said. The first commercial 12-module NuScale SMR is planned to be built on the site of the Idaho National Laboratory. It will be owned by the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems and run by utility Energy Northwest, which owns and operates the Columbia nuclear station. NuScale said its design offers the benefits of carbon-free power and reduces the financial commitments associated with gigawatt-size nuclear facilities. NuScale’s technology is also ideally suited to supply energy for district heating, desalination, and process heat applications. At the heart of the technology is the NuScale Power Module, an integral reactor vessel surrounded by a high pressure steel containment, which when coupled to its power generation equipment can produce 50 MW of electricity. A NuScale SMR plant can house up to 12 of these modules for a total facility output of 600 MW (gross). NuScale said the scalability afforded by the modular design allows customers to incrementally increase facility output to match demand."

The consortium is entering a £250m competition started in March 2016 by the UK government, which wants to find the best SMR design for civil use.  It is understood that Amec Foster Wheeler, Nuvia and Arup – together with the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre – are working with Rolls-Royce to develop the reactors. The companies are looking to create a partnership which will build “entire running power plants capable of powering a city”, the company said in an email on 9 January 2017. Once the initial design is licensed, parts can be made on a factory production line relatively cheaply. The companies see SMRs as complementary to the large reactor programme, rather than a replacement. They believe that SMRs will strengthen the UK’s energy security by reducing reliance on foreign gas imports and smoothing out the impact of intermittent generation technologies such as wind and solar. A spokesman for Rolls-Royce said: “We are working with some of Britain's most experienced civil engineering companies and nuclear research organisations to realise the huge potential SMRs for the wider UK economy. We are working together to deliver a whole power plant which could be up and running in just over a decade and provide a boost for the UK's industrial strategy.”"

Mr Deir said Canada needs larger SMR designs to form part of an overall large grid and small to very small designs for deployment in off grid or self-contained grid applications such as in the northern regions of Canada. But Mr Deir said one of the primary challenges will be overcoming the “first of a kind hurdle”. He said no community wants to be seen as the test for a novel reactor design, especially a community with limited to no experience in nuclear technology. Mr Deir said various utilities are carrying out studies to determine the applicability of various SMR technologies into their jurisdictions.

            "15 Nov (NucNet): The UK government is preparing to publish a roadmap that could kick-start the process of developing a ‘best value’ small modular reactor and putting it into commercial operation by the end of the next decade, David Dalton reports.",
            "In the summer of 2016 the UK government revealed which organisations will be eligible to take part in the first phase of its competition to find the “best value” small modular reactor (SMR) design for the UK.Of the 38 companies which submitted expressions of interest in the competition, 33 were told they could compete in the next round, according to the Sunday Times, which reported the news. The list itself was briefly published on a government website, but quickly removed. According to press reports, but as yet unconfirmed by the government, the list includes a number of major players in the development of new larger nuclear plants in the UK: EDF, the developer of Hinkley Point C; China National Nuclear Corporation, which is said to be in talks to share China General Nuclear’s 33.5% stake in Hinkley; GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy, the supplier of two Advanced Boiling Water Reactors (ABWRs) for the Wylfa Newydd plant in North Wales; and Westinghouse, the supplier of two AP-1000 reactors for the Moorside plant in Cumbria.The list also features NuScale Power, which plans to deploy its first SMR in the US state of Idaho in 2024, possibly putting the US ahead of the UK in the SMR race. Manufacturing giant Rolls-Royce is said to be another notable inclusion.And so the UK seems to be taking a lead in the development of SMRs. In its 2015 autumn budget statement, the government announced it would invest £250m (€280m) in an “ambitious nuclear research and development programme”, including in the SMR competition. When the government announced that competition in March it was bullish about the UK’s role in SMR development, saying it wanted to build one of the world’s first SMRs and that the competition would generate a list of SMR developers that could “deliver on the government’s objectives”. In a vision statement in 2013 the government had already said it wanted to become “a key partner in commercialising Generation III, IV and SMR technologies worldwide”.The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is finalising a roadmap for the development of SMRs in the UK in parallel with the first phase of the competition. The roadmap will be published in the coming months, although whether it will be affected by the change in personnel at the top of government following the June 2016 vote for Brexit remains to be seen.The idea behind SMRs is that, by virtue of being small and modular, large numbers of them can be pre-fabricated in factories to a single design before being transported on site and combined together to form larger plants. The hope is that constructing reactors in this way will bring down costs.  Stephen Tindale, director of the Alvin Weinberg Foundation, said SMRs could deliver energy that is even lower-carbon than energy from existing nuclear designs. They could be inherently and passively safe and have a significantly reduced proliferation risk. They would be cheaper to build than the Hinkley Point C EPR, and “very probably cheaper than any existing nuclear design”. They could be a means of re-using spent fuel and reducing the UK’s plutonium stockpile. Mr Tindale said the funding announced in the 2015 autumn budget statement should be allocated to possible reactors based on how well each reactor scores against a series of criteria: safety, cost, waste management, proliferation resistance, design experience, reactor flexibility, use of spent fuel/plutonium, and heat/hydrogen production. “The £250 million, over a period of five years, could deliver substantial progress towards these potential benefits of nuclear power – as long as it is sensibly spent,” he said.Mr Tindale urged the UK government to spread its spending of the £250m across SMRs, larger Generation IV reactors –  which could be considerably cheaper than existing nuclear designs due to less complex designs  – and ‘micro-reactors’ of under 20MW. These “plug and play” reactors offer even more flexibility than SMRs for supplying power and heat to isolated locations and energy intensive industry. Size matters, said Mr Tindale, but so does the type of technology used. Smaller versions of existing reactor designs have the potential to reduce construction costs and also to increase flexibility. But nuclear innovation funding should also be used to support Generation IV reactors, which could be considerably cheaper than existing nuclear designs due to less complex designs. Such reactors could be fueled either by thorium, plutonium and spent fuel. The UK has the largest plutonium stockpile in the world.A significant barrier to nuclear innovation in the UK is lack of regulatory capacity. Nuclear regulation in the UK is, rightly, strict and extensive. A generic design assessment (GDA) takes up to five years, and costs developers at least £35m in regulatory fees alone. The total cost, including costs of preparing all the documentation, is more than double this.The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) only has the capacity to undertake GDAs for two technologies at a time. It is assessing the AP1000 and Advanced Boiling Water Reactor designs, and will not begin assessing any other designs until one of these assessments is completed, which will be 2017 at the earliest. The capacity of the ONR should be expanded, argues Mr Tindale, so it can assess more than two designs at once. At an SMR conference in London recently delegates were told that the government has commissioned a “techno-economic assessment “, or TEA, of SMR plants. A cost impact study by Ernst & Young (EY) – which forms part of the TEA – has shown that “substantial work” is required to make SMRs economically viable and the government must select a single design in its SMR design competition to maximise economic benefits, EY’s Miranda Kirschel told the conference. “We found that a single design being deployed in the country would be a much more economic approach than having multiple designs,” she said.Ms Kirchel said the UK must “commit early” to modularisation and standardised design processes to maximise cost reductions and the government must invest in the supply chain and help structure the industry to turn the UK supply chain into a competitive operation. “There is still quite a long way to go to develop those skills, to build up the capacity that is required – to actually deliver,” she said.EY has already said the case for SMRs looks compelling. In a report published 12 months after the March 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi accident, the company said SMRs require less up-front capital than large-scale plants, and the modular design allows units to be deployed incrementally, so cash generated from the electricity sales of the first operational units can offset the negative cash flows of subsequent unit construction. There is less construction risk because standardised units can be built in a factory and shipped to site fully assembled and because SMRs are smaller there is less fuel and fewer radiation hazards. Some designs can be placed below ground level, providing additional radiation shielding and security benefits. EY said SMRs are “clean and reliable”, providing baseload supply, free of carbon emissions.NuScale, established in 2000, was one of the first companies to focus exclusively on SMR development. “In 2009, a lot of people still thought we were nuts,” said Mike McGough, chief commercial officer for NuScale. “Now there are other suppliers, and we see a real market for smaller, safe, incrementally scalable nuclear power plants.” Challenges in commercialising SMRs in the US include the regulatory process, financing, the supply chain and public acceptance. “We began our engagement with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission [NRC] in April 2008,” said Mr McGough. “With a design certification application running to nearly 10,000 pages, and 39 months for the NRC to review a new design, regulatory uncertainty can be a key challenge.” Building up a supply chain is also an issue, Mr McGough said. “Our reactor works by convection, conduction and gravity. But we still have components that have to be built, including the turbine and a purpose-built factory to manufacture the power modules. These take time and investment.”Independent credible estimates of global market demand are now required to assess the true economic benefits of building a UK SMR industry, EY’s Miranda Kirschel said. “Our findings show that the UK market alone is not big enough to realize the true economic benefits of SMR.”There are a substantial number of SMR concepts and designs at various stages of development around the world today. Some are being developed by universities as pure research and teaching projects, others by private investors looking to break into the new build market and several by the large international reactor vendors.According to the UK’s National Nuclear Laboratory, it is clear that the capital investment required for new nuclear build in the UK is challenging. The ability to raise several billions of pounds for a twin unit – Hinkley Point C, for example – is only possible by a few utilities in Europe and has seen the formation of consortia in the UK to look to address this issue. The major advantage that SMRs have regarding capital expenditure is that more operators and/or investors can consider a nuclear programme. With a cumulative cash flow for a fleet of SMRs being a fraction of that of large nuclear plants due to less capital outlay per unit, faster construction time and staggered build are possible – when one module is finished and starts producing electricity, it will generate positive cash flow for the next module to be built.The NNL is calling for an assessment of the economics of SMRs to be undertaken in the UK including the potential financial models. An understanding is needed to mitigate the risk of not only “first-of-a-kind” (FOAK) engineering, but also FOAK business and financial models. A siting study is needed, and an assessment of SMR technologies for a range of roles including district heating, industrial heat supply and plutonium management. The findings of such a study “could drive the potential nuclear choices in the future, including SMRs,” the NNL said.The NNL is also calling for a reassessment of the UK skills and manufacturing base for SMRs, including the potential for factories in the UK to manufacture the full required modules for SMRs. One company that has made progress on its plans for an SMR industry in the UK is Westinghouse, which has one of the most mature designs in the market. The design makes heavy use of technology derived from the AP1000 full-sized PWR, which is nearing the end of its GDA process and is planned for the UK’s Moorside site. At 225MW, it’s one of the larger designs.Westinghouse, owned by Toshiba, moved early to establish a strong potential UK supply chain – the company has signed agreements with the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (NAMRC) of Sheffield University, and through that is already collaborating with companies like Sheffield Forgemasters. The design uses the same fuel as the AP1000, which will be manufactured at Springfields, near Preston.Westinghouse said recently it will continue to work with the NAMRC on an additional advanced manufacturing study aimed at significantly reducing the build lead-times of its SMR. Westinghouse said the decision shows its commitment to “partnering with the UK government to deploy the company’s SMR technology”. Eugene Shwageraus, from Cambridge University’s department of nuclear engineering, also sees the potential in SMRs. “I buy the arguments that small reactors could be better,” he said. “I buy the argument of better safety, this basically boils down to the amount of water that you have with relation to surface area that you need to cool. For a small reactor this can be orders of magnitude larger than for a big reactor.“You can manufacture them in factories and have better quality controls and essentially economy of mass production working against your economy of scale. You can bring them online to match needed capacity better, so you don’t have overcapacity.”But Dr Shwageraus sounded a note of caution: “If you stack up the advantages SMRs do make sense, the piece that is missing is the first mover. To realise the economy of mass production, those vendors who develop SMRs will need a line of customers.”And for this, the UK government will need to pave the way.The Energy Technologies Institute concluded in a recent report that for an chance of an SMR to be operating in the UK by 2030, the government will need to “create the right environment” for increasing investor confidence. “This is critical if timely progressive investment is to be committed by each of the vendor, the vendor supply chain and the SMR developer with associated operator,” the report said. “In the next five years there is a role for government in delivering an SMR policy framework and associated actions. These actions are significant against the need to create investor confidence.”Stephen Tindale told NucNet he believes prime minister Theresa May is worried about lots of small nuclear reactors in different locations, on security grounds. “But SMRs are modular as well as small, so can be put together to make a big one. I don't think the fact that there’s a new government will make a significant difference on this in the way it did initially on Hinkley.”As for the roadmap itself, Mr Tindale is looking for a promise from the government “to get on with it quickly” and for agreements to cooperate with other governments. He wants to see the inclusion of closed nuclear fuel cycle Generation IV SMRs with the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity. Due within months, the roadmap needs to provide answers to many questions.How Are Small Modular Reactors Different? It is first worth defining what a “small modular reactor” (SMR) is. Small reactors are defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as those with an electricity output of less than 300 MW, although general opinion is that anything with an output of less than 500 MW counts as a small reactor. Modular reactors are manufactured at a plant and brought to the site fully constructed. They allow for less on-site construction, increased containment efficiency and heightened nuclear materials security. The combination of these three facets in SMRs is intended to provide a flexible, cost effective energy alternative. However, not all SMRs are necessarily completely factory built. The SMRs do manage to provide some economies of scale, but by the number of units produced rather than their physical size. The philosophy is to then add an incremental number of these smaller units at the same site (sharing common facilities etc) as and when the electricity demand is there, or as and when the revenue from the previous units is such that another unit can afford to be built by the owners."

            "14 Nov (NucNet): More than half of the UK’s electricity has come from low-carbon sources for the first time with nuclear making up the largest proportion of low-carbon power generation at 26% of the total across the third quarter of 2016, a report has found. The report said that the third quarter of 2016 saw more than 50% of Britain’s power come from low-carbon energy sources. Five years ago, low-carbon sources made up just over a quarter. The study said that the eventual decision to continue with the Hinkley Point C nuclear station means that more baseload nuclear power, in the form of large power stations and also possibly small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), will be coming on to the system in the coming years. They will in the main replace older nuclear power stations set to be decommissioned. The research from energy company Drax, which operates a biomass power station, found electricity from low-emission sources had peaked at 50.2 per cent between July and September 2016. Drax has launched the new quarterly report in collaboration with Imperial College London on trends in the UK energy market. The first edition published today, showed that low-carbon sources included UK nuclear, imported French nuclear, biomass, hydro, wind and solar. The report said: “Britain’s electricity was completely coal-free for nearly six days over the last quarter. Coal plants have been pushed off the system by competition from gas, nuclear and renewables.” The report said that 5 May 2016 was a historic day, the first time since 1881 that Britain burnt no coal to produce its electricity. “Far from being a one-off, this has continued to become the norm over summer.” Details online: http://bit.ly/2ex8yyE"

Westinghouse said the decision shows its commitment to partnering with the UK government to deploy the company’s SMR technology. Westinghouse said the efficiencies can provide important reductions in costs to customers while promoting growth in manufacturing within the UK, an important part of Westinghouse’s SMR programme. Earlier this year Nuclear AMRC carried out its first advanced manufacturing research study on the Westinghouse SMR’s reactor pressure vessel (RPV), one of the largest and most demanding parts of any reactor.  The study concluded that Westinghouse’s design had the potential to be efficiently manufactured in the UK, which Westinghouse sees as a significant growth market. Westinghouse said Nuclear AMRC has “broad experience” in design for the manufacture of large, complex parts for safety-critical applications, and its support will help to increase the efficiency of its SMR design. For the latest study, Westinghouse has also partnered with UK-based Cammell Laird. Westinghouse said it has already met the requirements necessary to manufacture fuel for the Westinghouse SMR in the UK – something no other SMR technology provider can offer."

            "10 Oct (NucNet): The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s near-term activities to prepare for the licensing of advanced non-light water nuclear reactor technologies are “generally consistent” with the industry’s focus over the same period, the Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute has told the NRC. In comments to the NRC, the NEI called an NRC strategy document on non-light water reactors “an important opportunity to assure alignment of NRC activities with the goals and priorities of the industry”. The NEI said the nuclear industry in the US is preparing for new reactor technology to supplant existing reactors in the coming decades. Dozens of companies are developing a variety of advanced non-light water reactor designs that differ substantially from the light-water reactors in use internationally. Some of these designs include non-traditional technologies such as high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, molten salt reactors and sodium-, lead- or gas-cooled fast reactors. The NEI said the companies’ efforts have strong bipartisan support in Congress, and several bills have been passed in the past two years to provide financial support as well as technical and material support from the US Department of Energy’s complex of national laboratories. The DOE and the industry anticipate that these advanced nonlight water reactors will be ready for deployment by the early 2030s, the NEI said. “Non-light water reactors, large light water reactors and small modular light water reactors – which are expected to be operational by the mid-2020s – will form an ‘all-of-the-above’ nuclear energy portfolio that will be required to meet future energy needs and clean air goals.” The NRC strategy document is online: http://bit.ly/2dRkHNN"

            "29 Sep (NucNet) Due to their smaller size and easier siting small modular reactors (SMRs) offer flexibility and could deliver low-carbon heat into cities via hot water pipelines up to 30km in length, according to a new report by the Energy Technologies Institute (ETI). The report says this flexibility opens up new potential sites and could help to decarbonise energy use in buildings. Consideration should be given to the concept of deploying SMRs as “CHP [combined heat and power] ready”, even if there is no firm local demand for district heating systems at the time of SMR deployment. This is because the additional costs are small and the potential future revenues large, bringing benefits to both consumers and SMR operators, the report says.  CHP generates electricity whilst also capturing usable heat that is produced in this process. This contrasts with conventional ways of generating electricity where vast amounts of heat is wasted. One of the benefits of SMRs is that they can be built to a standard design in factories before being assembled on site. This standardisation has the potential to accelerate cost reduction through the economy of multiples. The report says SMRs could be operating in the UK by 2030 and the government has a crucial role to play in encouraging early investor confidence. The report says that “a credible integrated schedule” can be achieved if action is taken to create investor confidence through the development of a policy framework which progressively reduces risks for an SMR developer. The ETI is a public-private partnership between global energy and engineering companies and the UK government. The report is online: http://bit.ly/2dbY6L9"

            "20 Sep (NucNet): No single energy technology is a panacea and there is no solution for the UK without new nuclear in the mix, EDF Energy chief executive officer Vincent de Rivaz told a conference in London. ",
            "According to a statement on the EDF Energy website, Mr de Rivaz said the future will include interconnectors, batteries, small modular reactors (SMRs), gas and large nuclear, renewables, central and decentralised generation. SMRs is a technology EDF Energy’s parent company, the largely state-owned French company EDF, is developing and which has great potential in the UK as a low-carbon option for the future, complementing large nuclear power stations and renewables, Mr de Rivaz said. “However, today no one can know how long it will take for policymakers, regulators and planners to approve these designs and what they will cost.” Mr de Rivaz said wind has a critical role to play in the energy future and EDF is investing in it. But he said wind’s intermittency means it will sometimes generate too little and sometimes too much so it will always need costly back-up power, and will sometimes result in excess power which is wasteful. EDF last week received approval from the UK government to go ahead with the construction of two EPR nuclear units at Hinkley Point in Somerset, England."

            "20 Sep (NucNet): When Russian president Vladimir Putin played host at the recent Russia-Asean summit in Sochi, where he hosted leaders of all 10 Asean countries, he took the opportunity to do some lobbying for state-owned nuclear corporation Rosatom, telling southeast Asian countries there that it was time to go nuclear.",
            "“The level of cooperation between Russia and Asean in the fuel and energy sphere needs to be taken to a new level,” Mr Putin was quoted as saying in the Russian press. “Moscow is ready to cover the market and is ready to offer member countries projects on the construction of next generation nuclear electrical power stations,” he said, reflecting the aggressive sales pitch Rosatom itself has been putting forward.None of the 10 Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries have any commercial nuclear stations. Nor are any of the 60 nuclear reactors being built worldwide going up in Asean states.But Rosatom, with Mr Putin’s support, sees the region as a source of potentially significant orders. It has already been on the offensive, signing numerous cooperation agreements and memoranda of understanding – the precursors to more binding agreements – in Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Indonesia. These agreements typically set out plans to cooperate in the design, construction and operation of nuclear power plants and research reactors. Most specify cooperation in areas such as research, nuclear and radiation safety, nuclear medicine and training. Mr Putin’s words were intended to demonstrate that Russia is serious about its role in Southeast Asia. But it is also well aware that it has a minuscule economic presence in the region when compared with China and the US.Alexander Gabuev, chair of the Russia in the Asia-Pacific Programme at the Carnegie Moscow Centre, said Russia’s trade volume with Asean was a relatively tiny $21.4bn in 2015, which is less than 1% of Asean’s overall turnover. He believes that Russia has the capability to account for 10 percent of Asean’s imports within the next five years.Nuclear can play a part because Asean’s developing economies need energy and many governments in the region see it as the most reliable low-carbon baseline energy option. In 2011, Asean energy ministers asked their governments to produce “robust work programmes” to help the region “get up to speed” with the latest nuclear safety standards, developments and technologies. A 2013 International Energy Agency report said nuclear had the highest assumed capital costs of key power generation technologies that could be used in Southeast Asia, but the best potential capacity factor and the longest plant economic lifetime. The report said fast-growing energy use in Southeast Asia will lead to a sharp rise in the region’s dependence on oil imports and a reduction in its surplus of natural gas and coal for export.Russia believes it is in a good position to cash in, particularly with its Generation III+ VVER-1200, a reactor which Rosatom says is the most powerful of its type and “the most technologically advanced globally”. There are VVER-1200 units at various stages of implementation in Russia, Belarus, Turkey, Egypt, Finland, Hungary and Bangladesh. Rosatom’s told NucNet its project portfolio includes 36 nuclear power units at various stages in 13 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific. It has announced initial agreements to build more reactors in countries including India and Iran. In both countries it has already built units that are in commercial operation.Revenue earned by Rosatom abroad grew 20 percent in 2015 to $6.2bn, up from $5.2bn in 2014. The company expects to reach $23bn by 2018 and $190bn within the next five years. By the end of 2015 the company’s portfolio of foreign orders had grown to $110.3bn and will bring in $22.9bn in foreign revenue from 2016-2018, said Rosatom’s financial director Nikolay Solomon. The strategy of increasing foreign orders is an “ambitious but achievable goal”, according to Rosatom’s South Asia regional director Evgeni Griva.To prepare for overseas growth – and to help pave the way for negotiations and contracts – Rosatom is opening regional offices.  At the sharp end of this expansion is Alexander Merten, president of Rusatom International Network (RIN). RIN was established in 2014 to set up and operate Rosatom’s regional centres, through which the company channels its efforts to promote Russian nuclear technology. RIM’s primary task is to gain direct access to information in “commercially attractive countries”. This, says Mr Merten, is why a physical presence in key regions is vital. Rosatom’s international network includes 11 offices in North and South Americas, South Africa, the Middle East and Europe.Staff in these offices promote products and services, providing support for the Rosatom group’s divisions in nuclear engineering and construction, fuel fabrication, nuclear services, and non-nuclear services such as equipment for cogeneration plants and petrochemical companies. Rosatom is also eyeing the nuclear medicine and isotope markets. Mr Merten said Russia’s domestic market has contracted “for well-known reasons” – sanctions imposed following its annexation of Crimea in 2014 – and so it has refocused on overseas markets. Currency revenue accounts for 50% of Rosatom’s total revenue, so it’s no surprise that it wants to strengthen its global position. “Because the ruble is weakening, every dollar earned is important for us,” Mr Merten said.Rosatom has decided it needs to diversify its international offering and not get stuck offering the conventional product range of large nuclear stations, Mr Merten said. The thinking is that not every country has the money to finance construction of a large nuclear power plant such as a Westinghouse AP1000 or Areva EPR, but might be interested in small modular reactors (SMRs) of 50-300 MW which Russia is developing and which it says are suited to remote networks in rural or isolated areas – perfect for Southeast Asia. Rosatom said its product range includes small research reactors, which are used in the scientific, educational and medial fields.It’s not only Asean where Russia is looking for new nuclear business. Rosatom recently signed a framework agreement potentially worth $300m (€266m) to build a radiation technology centre in Bolivia. What is more important, the entire project is financed by Bolivia. Mr Merten said this is “a small amount” compared with the price of a large nuclear power plant, but “money does not grow on trees”. He said: “Any amount, whether 10 million dollars or 100,000 dollars, comes in handy when it comes as currency revenue.”Mr Merten said RIN “does not do politics”. He said the company focuses on two things – the safety of its technologies and the benefits for itself and its international customers and partners. “Rosatom’s reputation as a responsible and reliable partner is as important for us as it is for our customers. Many projects can be, and actually are, carried out in partnerships with foreign colleagues. Floating nuclear stations can be built in partnership with foreign shipbuilding companies. This is where RIN comes in as a link between foreign manufacturers and Rosatom,” he said.In the past, if a foreign company asked for a proposal for a product that could be manufactured by several Russian companies, it was not unusual for several Rosatom Group companies to pitch for the contract without consulting one another.  These days, RIN helps Rosatom form a consortium of suppliers that can supplement each other's skills and produce a joint proposal. Whatever the project, the revenue makes its way to the parent company, Rosatom.Rosatom’s bullishness over new nuclear markets should not disguise an underlying concern about the outlay involved. RIM has a clear mandate from Rosatom to contribute to a group-wide cost reduction effort, said Mr Merten. “Cost reduction is really a task of Rosatom’s manufacturing divisions, but we are working on it too because it is not related to production alone, but also to operating expenses and business travel expenses, which are included in the final price of any product.”Many of Rosatom’s divisions have closed their foreign offices because its regional network provides the same range of services, said Mr Merten. And why fly a huge distance at great expense for preliminary meetings if there are regional offices and employees who can hold initial meetings and negotiations with potential customers? “At these meetings we get an idea of whether further contact is necessary. You know what it means to fly to Latin America? Five people fly there from Moscow just to find out whether their offer is of any interest. If not, they fly home. And these costs must be included in the price.”According to RIN’s calculations, the Rosatom group’s expenses for foreign business support could be reduced by up to 30% by 2018 as group companies continue to close their local offices and use RIN’s regional network instead. The key difference between the old network and the new one is that RIN acts for the whole industry and across the entire Rosatom product range. The contract in Bolivia was the result largely of work carried out by the RIN office in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, whose staff were able to arrange a meeting with Bolivia’s president Evo Morales.The scope of RIN’s overseas work is varied. In Indonesia the company is helping Rosatom develop large-scale nuclear power generation. In South Africa, RIN’s Johannesburg office is helping plan for an eight-unit nuclear station. The same office is active in Nigeria, Zambia, Tanzania and other Sub-Saharan countries that have announced plans to develop national nuclear industries. RIN’s regional offices in Europe are promoting Russia’s expertise in mechanical engineering (Atomenergomash) and equipment supplies and maintenance (Rusatom Service). RIN is helping implement new-build contracts in Hungary, for Paks Phase 2, and Finland, for Hanhikiv-1. A regional office in Eastern Europe supports the Belarusian-1 construction project and helps TVEL “solve problems” in Ukraine, where the government is trying to reduce its dependency on Russia, looking instead to Westinghouse and Areva.RIN is negotiating a nuclear station construction project in Argentina. It is also offering decommissioning services in a market valued in many estimates at €200bn ($224bn) over the next 15 years. Rosatom’s German-based subsidiary Nukem Technologies has won a contract for decommissioning the Philippsburg-1 reactor unit in Germany and will work in a consortium with Westinghouse, which is a rival in other projects. RIN cooperates with South Korea’s Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) in the United Arab Emirates, where Kepco is building the UAE’s first nuclear station at Barakah. Russian companies provide enrichment services and supply uranium to Barakah. Vladim Titov, Rosatom’s head for central Europe, said Russia’s interest in Asean is based on the fact that these growing markets need stable and cheap electric energy. Europe also needs new nuclear and despite recent political differences, it is a market where Rosatom sees possibilities. Finland, Hungary and the UK are implementing new nuclear projects. The energy strategy of the Czech Republic sees the construction of new nuclear. Romania and Slovenia say they have plans for new construction. And most existing projects in Europe are using Russian VVER technology – one unit in Finland, two in Hungary, two in Belorussia and two in Slovakia. Mr Titov said: “Only Flamanville-3 in France and Olkiluoto-3 in Finland are using the French EPR design. So seven out of nine units in Europe are Russian.”The politics is not an issue, he said. “Rosatom’s position is simple and transparent. We always fulfill our contractual commitments even in difficult political circumstances. Nuclear projects have a long lifecycle and any new nuclear project is a project for 100 years.”"

            "16 Sep (NucNet): Ministerial consultations are taking place in relation to a report on Poland’s first nuclear power station project, local media said, quoting sources in the Polish ministry of energy. According to the media, the report was to be released by the end of June 2016, but was delayed without any revised schedule. The Polish energy ministry is also said to be updating the technical, organisational, and financial details of the proposed Polish nuclear programme, which according to state-controlled utility Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE) includes the options of building a small modular reactor (SMR) or a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTR). Earlier this month, PGE updated a strategy which lists nuclear power as one of the options for development in a new investment programme after 2020. In July 2016, PGE’s chief executive Henryk Baranowski said the company is not abandoning plans to build the country’s first nuclear power reactors, but the nature of the project might be modified and not realised until after 2030. According to earlier reports, Poland had intended to build four or five units with combined output of about 6,000 MW by the mid-2030s."

            "12 Sep (NucNet):  The UK needs new nuclear generating capacity to replace its ageing fleet, to provide stable supplies of low-carbon electricity for decades to come and to reduce the country’s reliance on imported energy, members of EDF Energy’s stakeholder advisory panel have said in a letter published in the Financial Times. The panel, whose members include former Confederation of British Industries director-general Sir Richard Lambert and former European commissioner Lord Patten of Barnes, said wind and solar have a crucial part to play in the UK’s energy future, but are by their nature intermittent sources of power. The panel said no one knows how long it will take for new technologies – such as advanced forms of battery storage or small modular nuclear reactors – to contribute to the energy mix at an affordable price. The panel said that when it comes to value for money, “we do not know what the price of electricity will be in 30 years”. But the panel said it believes today’s depressed wholesale prices are not a basis for comparison, and that the deal that has been struck for Hinkley Point C is competitive with other future energy options when the price of carbon is properly costed. The panel said EDF, of which EDF Energy is the UK subsidiary, has been working closely with its Chinese partners in Hinkley Point for many years. “Together, they are close to the successful completion of two reactors in Taishan. We are confident that the regulatory regime in the UK will provide rigorous oversight of all nuclear operators, wherever they come from.” The plan to build two EPR units at Hinkley Point was hit with an unexpected delay in July 2016 when the incoming British prime minister Theresa May decided to hold a review of the project only hours after EDF – the project’s state-owned French developer – had given it the go-ahead. Reports have hinted at tensions between London and Beijing over the delay. The EDF Energy panel said in its letter that the UK government is expected to conclude its review of the project “in the next few weeks”."

            "29 Aug (NucNet): Critics of the Hinkley Point C nuclear station project in southwest England are at risk of “losing sight of the bigger picture” by failing to see the “positive impact and importance “ of the investment for the UK, EDF Energy chief executive officer Vincent de Rivaz wrote in an article published on the company’s website yesterday. ",
            "The plan to build the two EPR units for £18bn (€21bn, $24bn) at Hinkley Point was hit with an unexpected delay in July as the new UK government decided to hold another review only hours after EDF – the project’s state-owned French developer – had given it the go-ahead.",

            "Mr de Rivaz wrote that China’s participation “is much more” than £6bn of investment as it brings the benefits of a 30-year partnership between EDF and CGN in nuclear construction in China.",
            "He wrote that the cost of Hinkley Point’s electricity should be compared with future energy prices and not those of today. Hinkley Point will be competitive with all future energy options, including fossil fuels, when the cost of carbon is taken into account, Mr de Rivaz added.",
            "On the potential use of small modular reactor technology in the UK, Mr de Rivaz wrote that it is still surrounded by a number of future political and regulatory uncertainties and “we can’t afford to cross our fingers and muddle through in the hope that a new technology will meet all our needs at the right price”.",

            "11 Aug (NucNet): The Utah-based energy consortium Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems has identified a preferred site at the US Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory for NuScale Power's first small modular reactor project, NuScale said on its website. UAMPS chief executive officer Doug Hunter said a location in the southern part of the 1,000-square-km laboratory site was determined to be best for development of a station with a capacity of 600 MW made up of 12 50-MW modules. Mr Hunter said the location is ideal because it would not interfere with any Idaho National Laboratory facilities or research, and the geology is stable. UAMPS will be the owner-operator of the plant, which is scheduled to be operational around 2024-2025 to coincide with expected closures of fossil-fuelled generating assets. NuScale Power was incorporated in 2007 to design and commercialise an SMR. In October 2011, Texas-based multinational Fluor Engineering became the majority investor and to date has invested over $170m (€152m) in NuScale. In December 2013, the Department of Energy announced its selection of NuScale Power to receive up to $226m of matching funds to support the further development of the design and to secure design certification from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission."

            "The proposed Hinkley Point C Nuclear Power Plant project has experienced controversy in the public since its inception. Some critics have raised concerns about UK infrastructure being foreign owned, being part owned by the French energy company EDF and part funded by China’s CGN Group. To secure the £18bn (€21bn) investment, the previous government, led by David Cameron, agreed to a complex subsidy arrangement, which could see consumers paying billions more if future wholesale electricity prices become lower, which they are currently predicted to do. The nuclear technology is also untested, which has led to questions around safety.",
            "However the proposed Hinkley plant also has many benefits. It will be the biggest construction site in Europe, providing 25,000 construction jobs. When it is finished it will employ 900 people, including the next generation of nuclear engineers. It will generate low carbon energy, providing enough power for six million homes, and supplying seven per cent of the UK's electricity needs over its 60 year lifetime.Last month, incoming prime minister Theresa May announced that the government would be hitting the pause button, to review the proposed project and make a decision by autumn. Here, six experts from Imperial College London, one of Europe’s top science-based universities, give their opinions on Hinkley Point C.>>>Professor Michael Bluck, Director of the Centre for Nuclear EngineeringNuclear power is widely accepted as a vital component in the energy mix, and Hinkley C will provide important base-load in support of other low-carbon, but intermittent technologies, such as wind and photovoltaics.The construction and commissioning of Hinkley C will also provide a focus for the reinvigoration of the UK nuclear industry and the associated skills development necessary for future nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors (SMRs), which could be built in a factory and transported to a location, making them cheaper to make and run, and Generation IV reactors, which would use nuclear waste from other reactors to power them, making them more efficient, and potentially even safer than current versions.>>>Dr Ben Britton, Lecturer/RAEng Research Fellow, Director of MSc in Advanced Nuclear Engineering in Department of MaterialsDecarbonisation of the UK’s energy mix is critical in light of climate change. Wind, tidal, solar and nuclear all have their roles to play in diversifying our energy mix. To contextualise the scale of the Hinkley project – it is approximately equivalent to a solar farm that takes up an area the size of the Isle of Wight. At £2k per kW this solar project would cost £6.4bn. Hinkley C is built to last 60 years. Typical solar farms have a warranty of 25 years. Note also that this estimated cost for solar does not include decommissioning and cleanup.A nuclear power station is a great opportunity for the UK to re-invigorate our nuclear engineering workforce. There are many exciting opportunities for skilled UK graduates, both in the supply chain, operation and management of our nuclear fleet. These jobs require highly skilled individuals with a diverse range of expertise, combined with a holistic understanding of engineering in a nuclear context. It is likely that Hinkley C is the first of many opportunities in the UK emergent nuclear future and I anticipate significant investments in other reactor designs, as well as the emergence of SMRs and exciting new designs for generation IV reactors.>>>Alyssa Gilbert, Head Policy and Translation, the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, at Imperial College LondonA diverse, low-carbon supply of energy is essential to deliver on the UK’s goals for energy security and climate change. Nuclear energy should be part of the mix, however, the costs of the Hinkley Point C deal have been questioned from the very beginning. The Government needs to first reassure potential investors that the UK is genuinely open for business by setting out clearly and transparently what the reasons are for revisiting this decision. This new review must then quickly and definitively determine if this investment is good value for money, or what the best alternative plan is that will deliver clean, secure energy at a reasonable cost.>>>Professor Joanna Haigh, co-Director of the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, at Imperial College LondonThe passing of the fifth carbon budget, and the Government’s restated commitment to a low-carbon future, are very welcome but a reliance on the Hinkley Point C project to achieve these aims would be misplaced, as well as very costly. What is needed for the UK to meet its stated targets is swift action now on energy efficiency, perhaps with a revamped ‘green deal’, and serious implementation of existing renewable energy technologies. In addition, investing in low-carbon 'cleantech' innovation would be a win-win situation for the UK’s environment and economy.>>>Professor Martin Siegert, co-Director of the Grantham Institute Climate Change and the Environment, at Imperial College LondonThe International Energy Agency's Energy Technology Perspectives 2016 points to an increase in the level of nuclear energy, if we are to limit global warming to the 2°C target set by the Paris Agreement. The delays and difficulties in obtaining the go-ahead for Hinkley Point C are clearly not optimal for this necessary change to happen.To resolve the issue, either we accept that nuclear power cannot be enhanced much beyond its present levels, in which case further increases in renewable energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS) will be needed, or we renew global efforts to drive innovation and success in safe, affordable nuclear power. If we decide the latter is preferable, then investment in education, research and innovation in nuclear engineering is urgently needed both within the UK and in many of the world’s top universities and research establishments.>>>Dr Mark Wenman, Lecturer in Nuclear Engineering Materials, member of the Centre for Nuclear EngineeringHinkley Point C is vitally important for the UK for several reasons:  The UK remains focused on phasing out coal power stations and at the same time many nuclear stations will also be closing. This means the UK would face potential energy shortages, in the mid-2020s, even with solid growth in renewables such as wind and solar.  At the same time the UK needs to remain committed to reducing CO2 emissions and Hinkley C, if built on time, would provide secure low carbon energy just when we need it.Although other nuclear projects have been delayed in Europe, this provides the opportunity to show that big infrastructure projects can be delivered in the UK, which may bring further investment and jobs. From the point of view of the Centre for Nuclear Engineering this will provide great opportunities for our top graduate students and potentially be a big boost to research income when relationships with the EU are strained.>>> This article was originally written for Imperial College London by Simon Levey and Colin Smith.

Yesterday more than 100 engineering, manufacturing and construction companies from across the UK attended NuScale’s first suppliers’ day at Nuclear AMRC in Sheffield. NuScale said the event was part of a long-term objective to build NuScale’s UK supply chain in preparation for “potential [SMR] deployment in the UK market”. NuScale said it has been building a presence in the UK for three years and is participating in the government’s competition to choose the best value SMR for the UK. NuScale also announced that it had formally become a supporting partner of the Nuclear AMRC. Both organisations have been collaborating informally since 2014, but the formal agreement will mean they can work together in the UK civil nuclear industry, a statement said. In the US NuScale is at an advanced stage of SMR development. It is the only SMR developer to be receiving US Department of Energy match funding of $217m (€195m) over five years and the only SMR developer to be close to submitting a design certification application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, scheduled for later this year. The first NuScale SMR facility is planned to be in operation in 2024 in the state of Idaho. "

            "5 Jul (NucNet): Technology, economy, and market potential are the main challenges that small modular reactor (SMR) developers must consider in their development planning, Bernard Salha, EDF’s R&D director, said at the World Nuclear Exhibition in Paris last week. He said the sizes of SMRs need to be optimised to strike a balance between generating capacity, cost, and safety. “If [the size] is too small the cost is going to be very high”, Mr Salha said. He said SMRs should be flexible when operating in the energy mix together with renewables. This means that SMR power levels should be easily adjustable, both upwards and downwards, when the grid requires it. Mr Salha said site work makes up the bulk of the cost for new-build reactors, but SMRs could change the cost emphasis from site work to manufacturing because “serial factory production” could reduce the number of activities that need to be managed onsite. Such costs will be more predictable, Mr Salha said. He said the new-build landscape a decade from now will be very different from today because nuclear will have to work with renewables, grids will become smaller and more flexible, and less investment will be available for new-build."

Speaking at the AtomExpo conference in Moscow Harry Holt said the nuclear industry is “not going to be exempt from the substantial changes that data analytics, big data, digitalisation, call it what you will” is bringing about in other sectors. He said Rolls Royce has decades of experience harnessing data to provide services for customers in other industries, for example, aircraft engine monitoring and fuel efficiency services for the aerospace industry. “We believe very firmly that we can leverage that experience to provide similar services to the nuclear sector to help our utility customers make the operation of their plants even more competitive and effective,” he said. Mr Hill said the company’s emergency diesel generator business is “an exciting part of the business with lots of opportunity for growth”. He said 300 such systems provided by Rolls Royce are in operation in 15 countries. Mr Holt said more than 200 of the company’s I&C systems are in operation in 20 countries. “We are agnostic on the technologies we support. Our safety systems can go on any technology.” Mr Holt said: “We are doing a lot of work at the moment with Rosatom, both domestically and in their expert markets, helping the new build at Hanhikivi [in Finland] and the modernisation and retrofit programme at Loviisa [Finland]. Rolls Royce is involved in the modernisation of 20 reactors in EDF’s 1,300-MW fleet in France and is working on CPR-1000 units under construction in China.

            "4 Apr (NucNet): The total projected cost of investments in the complete nuclear fuel cycle in the European Union for the period from 2015 to 2050 will vary between €650bn ($738bn) and €760bn ($863bn), according to the new Illustrative Programme for Nuclear Energy, known as Pinc, released by the European Commission today.",
            "The investment in new nuclear stations needed to replace most of the existing nuclear reactors in order to maintain a stable nuclear generation capacity over the next 35 years will amount to a figure between €350bn and €450bn, Pinc says. About 90 percent of the existing nuclear capacity will need to be replaced by 2050. The EC estimates that electricity generation from nuclear will decrease by 2025 due to the phase-outs of nuclear energy in certain member states, but the trend will reverse after 2030 with generation capacity reaching between 95 and 105 gigawatts (GW) by 2050. The figure is lower than the current EU capacity estimated at 120 GW. In relative terms, the share of nuclear energy will fall from about 27 percent today to about 20 percent in 2050, the report says.According to Pinc, more than 50 of the 129 reactors in commercial operation in the EU are to be shut down by 2025. Based on the latest available data from 2014, total investment of €253bn will be needed by 2050 for the back-end of the fuel cycle. The actual decommissioning will require €123bn, while €130bn will be invested in radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel management and deep geological disposal. Pinc says approximately € 133bn of these expected costs have already been set aside in dedicated decommissioning and radioactive waste management funds spread among EU member states. The report estimates lifetime extension and long term operation (LTO) costs at between €45bn and €50bn for existing reactors by 2050. The average LTO extension period is expected by most national regulators to be 10 to 20 years. On the front-end of the fuel cycle, with respect to the European Energy Security Strategy, the EC aims to ensure a well-functioning internal market for nuclear fuels and to guarantee security of supply. Pinc says the focus in the coming years will be on modernizing enrichment capabilities in the EU in order to maintain the EU technological leadership. Nuclear fuel manufacturing capacities in the EU will be enough to cover the needs of western-designed reactors, while fuel licensing and fabrication for the EU’s Russian-designed reactors would take “a few years” depending on the available investment and market environment, the report says.The EC is mandated to periodically issue a new Pinc under Article 40 of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) Treaty in order to indicate non-binding targets and programmes for nuclear production and any necessary investment. The last Pinc update was released in 2008 before the March 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi accident.According to the new document, the EU nuclear landscape “has undergone significant changes” including comprehensive risk and safety assessments – known as stress tests – and culminating with the adoption of “landmark legislation on nuclear safety, radioactive waste and spent fuel management and radiation protection”.In contrast to the new Pinc, the 2008 paper did not include any investment cost estimates, but rather provided a snapshot of the status nuclear sectors in various EU member states at the time.The 2016 Pinc also touches on aspects of the EU regulatory environment. The EC recognises that some new “first of a kind” projects in the EU have experienced delays and cost overruns and suggests a policy based on cooperation between regulators when licensing new reactors and on standardisation of nuclear reactor design by the industry. Synchronising licensing requirements should ensure that a design qualified as safe in one country does not have to be substantially modified to meet licensing requirements elsewhere, therefore reducing time and costs, the EC said. Industrial standardisation should ensure faster procurement processes, higher comparability and more transparent safety standards as well as increased capacity of operators to control technology and knowledge management.In terms of new regulation, the EC also says it will propose later this year an update to Article 103 of the Euratom Treaty, which will aim to strengthen the EC’s “ability to ensure” that new investments and bilateral agreements with third countries in the field of nuclear energy comply with the Euratom Treaty and meet security of supply requirements. Pinc says the EU must maintain its technological leadership in the nuclear domain, since it will give business opportunities for European companies and help support EU growth, jobs and competitiveness. Initiatives suggested by the EC include the future deployment of Generation-IV closed-cycle nuclear systems, research and development on small modular reactor (SMR) technology, progress at the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France, and maintaining an “appropriate” expertise level in the nuclear field through continuous training and education.Nuclear energy, a low carbon technology and significant contributor to security of supply, is expected to remain an “important component” of the EU’s energy mix by 2050, the report concludes.The report is online: http://bit.ly/1YarqPP "

Nuclear AMRC will provide an independent assessment of the current Westinghouse small modular reactor RPV design, and determine “an optimal manufacturing solution”. Westinghouse said Nuclear AMRC has extensive experience in design for the manufacture of large complex parts for safety-critical applications. A key component of the manufacturing study will be identifying efficiencies within the manufacturing process to “reduce capital costs and drive project savings”. The study will also identify potential suppliers for when the Westinghouse SMR enters production.  Last year Westinghouse said it wants to work in partnership with the UK government to deploy its SMR technology. Westinghouse’s Springfields facility, near Preston in northern England, recently achieved the requirements necessary to manufacture Westinghouse SMR fuel in the UK, something that no other SMR technology provider offers. Nuclear AMRC, owned by the University of Sheffield, is a collaboration of academic and industrial partners from across the civil nuclear manufacturing supply chain."

This includes making significant progress on the legacy ponds and silos at Sellafield, some of the most hazardous facilities in the UK.Between 2016-17 and 2019-20 the government will save over £1bn by making efficiencies and savings in the NDA through better value contracts; top class commercial procurement; delaying non-safety-critical projects; and cancelling a project that is no longer needed due to “a world-first breakthrough in nuclear decommissioning research”. The statement did not give details of the project.The London-based Nuclear Industry Association welcomed the government’s commitment to the nuclear sector and its additional funding for nuclear research and development, including the development of SMRs.However, the NIA raised concerns that no funding was allocated to develop “a reuse option” for the UK’s plutonium stockpile. The NIA said it believes that “now is the time for the government to put firm plans in place for dealing with this valuable asset”.

Oregon-based NuScale plans to deliver its first commercial plant in late 2023 at an LCOE of $100/MWh, NEI reported. The 600 MW plant is to be built up of 50 MW modules and installed in Idaho, delivered to owner-operator Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems to coincide with expected closures of fossil-fuelled generating assets. Speaking at NEI’s Small Modular Reactor UK Summit, Mr Mundy said the estimated LCOE for the first-of-a-kind plant in Idaho is based on the latest US cost assumptions made by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Material cost savings for subsequent reactors are expected to reduce levelised costs by between four percent and eight percent, and along with other savings the LCOE could drop from $100/MWh to $90/MWh or below, Mr Mundy said. In a report published in June, the EIA estimated the total system LCOE of conventional combined cycle gas turbine plants entering service in 2020 would be $75, compared with $95/MWh for advanced nuclear plants. LCOE is the long-term price at which the electricity produced by a nuclear station will have to be sold at for the investor to cover all their costs.  Full story: http://bit.ly/1kcgzYn"

Mr Johnson said: “We will put power on the grid before we go to commercial operations, which is actually an accounting term.” Mr Johnson said one of the conclusions of the company’s long-term integrated resource plan is that “when we finish what we are currently building, we will not need to build any new baseload [capacity] until the early- to mid-2030s”. He said TVA has great interest in small modular reactors and is preparing a site that will be ready when the market has an offering. He said so far, there is no SMR design to purchase. “As for the unfinished Bellefonte reactor site in Alabama, we will not need a large baseload unit for the next 15 years or so. We will continue to keep that as an option but are not pursuing it actively.” Last week the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued TVA with a 40-year operating licence for Watts Bar-2. The NRC said Watts Bar-2, a 1,165-megawatt Westinghouse pressurised water reactor unit, is the first US reactor it has authorised to operate since 1996, when it issued the licence for Watts Bar-1.

This is just one example of how NPIC is seeking to innovate and apply new ways of using nuclear technology for robust power supply, the company said.NPIC has both civilian and military functions. According to the Washington-based Nuclear Threat Initiative, it designed and built China’s first pressurised water reactor, its first high flux reactor, its first pulse reactor, as well as the Min Jiang Test Reactor. NPIC is involved in reactor design and safety research, and produces medical isotopes."

            "31 Aug (NucNet): The costs of nuclear energy “remain in line” with the costs of other baseload technologies, says a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Nuclear Energy Agency (OECD/NEA).",
            "The report, ‘Projected Costs of Generating Electricity’, estimates that the average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for a nuclear station is comparable to that for coal and lower than that of a natural gas-fired power station. LCOE is the long-term price at which the electricity produced by a nuclear station will have to be sold at for the investor to cover all their costs. The report’s estimate assumes a seven percent discount rate. The discount rate refers to the expected rate of return foregone by bypassing other potential investments. In other words, it is the rate of return investors could potentially earn in financial markets.The highest LCOE for a nuclear power station with a seven percent discount rate is in the United Kingdom, where it is $100.75 per megawatt-hour (MWh) and the lowest is in South Korea, where it is $40.42 per MWh. The mean is estimated at around $82 per MWh.The report says that, due to the high capital intensity of nuclear power stations, a 10 percent discount rate is more appropriate. At this discount rate, nuclear power is more expensive than both coal and natural gas-fired power stations.The report says the LCOE for nuclear power has increased slightly but remains “roughly on par” in comparison to the previous edition of the report, published in 2010.Taking into account a 10 percent discount rate, the report says the average LCOE for a nuclear station increased from about $90 per MWh in 2010 to $115 per MWh in 2015.The report says a large number of existing nuclear stations are reaching their initial design lifetimes and extensive refurbishments, safety upgrades and lifetime extension programmes are likely to take place within the next 20 years.In its reference scenario, the report estimates that the LCOE of a nuclear station which has undergone a lifetime extension programme is between €23 per MWh and €26 per MWh.These results for the LCOE “compare favourably” with other electricity generation sources and “deserve attention”, the report says.The report looks at the future prospects of energy technologies and says that by 2030 the focus in nuclear energy will fall on small modular reactors (SMRs) and prototypes of Generation IV reactors.“SMRs can target niche markets and countries with small electricity grids that require baseload power,” the report says. In the best-case scenario, SMRs are expected to have total electricity generation cost equal to large nuclear power stations if all competitive advantages of SMRs are realised, the report says. Those advantages include serial production, optimised supply chains and lower up-front financing costs,The report suggests that to open up the market for SMRs, governments and industry should work together to identify target markets and accelerate the deployment of SMR prototypes in those markets.For Generation IV technologies, the report calls on governments to assess the long-term benefits of developing such designs.The report says public-private partnerships need to be put in place between governments and industry in order to develop demonstration projects for the application of co-generation technology in nuclear stations. Co-generation is where a power station produces both electrical power and heat for residential and commercial heating requirements (“district heating”), resulting in an increase in the station’s efficiency."

            "13 Aug (NucNet): Australia has a great opportunity to expand uranium mining in the coming two decades, but reforms are needed to form the bedrock of industry development at both state and national level, the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) has said.",
            "In a submission to a royal commission examining the potential for an expansion of South Australia’s role in the nuclear industry, the MCA said the country’s uranium industry wants to take advantage of continuing strong uranium demand stemming from forecasted growth for low emissions nuclear energy, “especially in our region”.The MCA said Australia has the best uranium resource base in the world, most of it in South Australia.But the MCA said laws need to be amended to ensure uranium projects are treated as any other resource project for environmental assessment purposes.New federal legislation is needed to provide a streamlined environmental assessment and approvals process, the MCA said.And developing consistent policies towards the treatment of uranium exploration, extraction and milling across states and territories would provide investor confidence.The MCA said the uranium industry should have access to “the most appropriate” transport routes and ports across states and territories in order to secure the most competitive access to markets.It called for the removal of legislative and regulatory impediments to the establishment of nuclear fuel cycle industries.“Australia has underperformed in recent years,” the MCA said. “Australia’s share of global production lags dramatically behind its share of global resources. This is a reflection of the historical impediments to development of the industry.“These reforms would improve the uranium industry’s competitiveness and investment attractiveness and put us on a path towards increasing our share of global production. This translates into thousands more jobs and a dramatically larger uranium economy.”In a separate submission the MCA said it “strongly supports” the consideration of nuclear energy as part of South Australia’s and Australia’s electricity mix. “Nuclear power is a well-established, globally deployed technology capable of providing low emissions, reliable electricity supply in the decades ahead.”The MCA said that although nuclear energy is well established, it remains an industry with tremendous scope for innovation and additional research and development. While large Generation III reactors are the main reactor designs being constructed today, enormous potential exists in the area of small modular reactors and Generation IV fast reactors.The royal commission, expected to report around March 2016, will consider whether there is any potential for expansion of exploration, extraction or milling of minerals containing radioactive materials in South Australia. It will also look into the feasibility of the state becoming involved in conversion, enrichment, fuel fabrication or reprocessing; the generation of electricity from nuclear fuels; and the management, storage and disposal of non-military nuclear and radioactive waste.The MCA submissions to the royal commission are online: http://bit.ly/1P8DKf8"

            "10 Aug (NucNet): The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission is to direct agency staff to develop new emergency preparedness regulations and guidance for small modular reactors (SMRs) and other new reactor technologies. NRC staff had told the commission in May 2015 that it is reasonable to consider a new EP framework because of the advancements in reactor designs and their associated design features. Russ Bell, the Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute’s senior director for new plant licensing, said the industry was pleased with the commission’s approval to take the next steps to establish a regulatory framework for emergency preparedness that reflects the design and safety advantages of SMRs and other new technologies. He said the NRC’s action is timely, given the progress small reactor vendors and prospective customers are making to submit licensing documents to the NRC. Early next year the Tennessee Valley Authority plans to seek an early site permit for its project to deploy two or more small reactors at its Clinch River site in Tennessee. In addition, NuScale Power expects to submit by the end of 2016 a design certification application for its NuScale SMR, while Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems will apply for a combined construction and operating licence for the NuScale project by late 2017 or early 2018."

            "29 Apr (NucNet): As the US nuclear industry prepares for its first phase of pilot applications for operating licence renewals up to 80 years, Nuclear Energy Institute president and chief executive officer Marvin Fertel talks to NucNet about challenges for the nuclear sector, the future of the Yucca Mountain project, and the impact of shutting down reactors for economic reasons.",
            "NucNet: The Nuclear Energy Institute advocates the use of a “diversified portfolio” of electricity sources. What do you think is the optimal share of nuclear in such a portfolio?MF: We have not identified an optimal share as such. We propose that in 2030 the share of nuclear in the US energy mix should be at least 20 percent. This is approximately the share it has today. We know that there will be increases and decreases in the share of nuclear due to some plants having to shut down as they reach the end of their lifetime. So, we have set a target of at least 20 percent but we have not tried to identify an optimal level.NucNet: What are the biggest challenges to the development of nuclear energy in the US?MF: Continued operation, or second licence renewal as we call it, is going to work very well. There has been a lot of technical work done at the national laboratories in the US to identify any technical or safety challenges. What we are going to see is that some plants will not complete their existing licences for different reasons. However, we are expecting to go into a phase of pilot applications for licence renewals in 2016 for those reactors which might extend operation up to 80 years. I think these pilot applications will be successful.For new builds, especially when we look at Vogtle-3 and -4 and Summer-2 and -3, we need to establish the market well. Based on the analysis, these reactors are the best deals for their customers. However, we need to work on reducing the time it takes to complete these projects from the 10 to 12 years which they take now.In competitive, deregulated markets, we believe that small modular reactors [SMRs] could be the solution. We are optimistic that if SMRs can be developed and built in the right way, they could be the solution. Also, if the US ever develops a price on carbon dioxide emissions, everything will change. This would change the whole decision-making process, and the economic arguments for and against nuclear will change as well.NucNet: Anti-nuclear activists have challenged the licence renewal process for all 23 General Electric Mark I-type reactors operational in the US because they are the same type as the reactors at Fukushima-Daiichi. Is this going to be a problem for operating licence renewals?MF: The pilot applications for licence renewal will most probably be for GE Mark I-type reactors. We do not think there was anything unique about this type of reactor, but rather there were a lot of complex issues which led to the Fukushima-Daiichi accident evolving like it did. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has required special improvements for these reactors and these improvements will dramatically improve the way the reactors deal with possible severe accidents. I think we will see a lot of opposition, but I am reasonably confident that if the decisions are made on technical and safety grounds the Mark I-type reactors should receive licence renewals.NucNet: In 2014, the operators of Vermont Yankee were forced to shut it down due to its lack of competitiveness on the deregulated electricity market. What has been the economic and societal impact of the shutdown?MF: The impact on local town of Vernon, Vermont, has been dramatic. Several hundred high-paying jobs have been lost in the town alone. About $1.3 million [€1.1 million] in annual taxes has been lost to the town, which accounts for about half of its tax base. The town had to vote on extreme measures to reduce costs recently, one of them being the possible elimination of the police force. In the region, more than 1,100 jobs have been lost and $480 million of economic activity will disappear in the coming years. I dare say that none of this was contemplated by the small group of protestors who worked to shut down the plant.A recent report said that the Northeast region will face significant problems with electricity supply and grid reliability. Vermont Yankee is already shut down and there are other nuclear plants which are at risk of being forced to shut down. Apart from the economic impact, we might see a significant electricity and reliability impact. These issues will either have to be fixed or we are going to have significant problems in individual states in the long-term future.NucNet: Do you think the example of Vermont Yankee can be applied to other cases where nuclear stations could be shut down, in Illinois for example?MF: I think the shutdown of Vermont Yankee, and Kewaunee before it, helped the case for nuclear power plants in Illinois. The state legislators, the governor and others realised that if the markets are dysfunctional, many plants will shut down. It has been a real eye-opener for them and it has helped. From another viewpoint, the state commission in Illinois has produced several studies which showed the possible impact of shutting down six nuclear stations [Braidwood, Byron, Clinton, Dresden, LaSalle and Quad Cities] in the state, which are considered at risk. The studies showed effects, which are not only dramatic on the economy in terms of lost jobs and reductions in gross domestic product, but also that the price of electricity to customers would increase substantially due to a lack of supply. It would be cheaper for customers if we were to figure out how to keep these plants operational. NucNet: In February 2014, there was a radiological incident at the Department of Energy’s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. What impact has that had on the issue of nuclear waste disposal?MF: The incident at WIPP has had no impact on the issue of commercial waste disposal because we are not making any progress on developing a commercial nuclear waste facility. WIPP is a site for waste from the national nuclear defence programme, but I think lessons from the incident have had a positive impact on the safety culture one should have at any waste disposal facility. Recent reports into the accident point out significant weaknesses in the safety culture and in the decision-making process. The accident will help us learn and apply the lessons learned to commercial disposal facilities for both low- and high-level radioactive waste.Another aspect that has emerged is that there is a problem with the safety culture at the US National Laboratories. From the standpoint of the nuclear industry in general, we would like to see all actors handle the material in the safest way, whether they are a National Laboratory, a defence programme or a commercial company. One of the issues we have learned about from this incident is that there is a problem with documentation procedures as well as decision-making on how some waste handling processes were changed at the Los Alamos Laboratory without any real management review.NucNet: The Yucca Mountain project has faced political opposition for many years, especially from Nevada Senator Harry Reid. Do you think his retirement at the end of 2016 will change the situation? MF: I think Senator Reid’s retirement will make the possibility of discussing the issue of Yucca Mountain in the Senate much more viable. Senator Reid was passionate and dedicated to preventing the project and his leadership position had an impact on the rest of his caucus. While there might be others in the Democratic caucus, or even in the Republican caucus, who are opposed to the project, the dialogue will improve. With Senator Reid retiring, I think there will be a much more open discussion. With good dialogue the Yucca Mountain project ought to go forward – and we certainly ought to finish the licensing process. If the licensing process proves that the facility is safe, we would have a viable option for disposing of radioactive waste. If it does not prove the facility’s safety, then we would have finished the licensing process and be able to understand what the issues and problems are and how we should go about doing the analysis and assessments for any other repository. NucNet: In Europe there is discussion about diversification of the sources of uranium and nuclear fuel. Is the US worried about its uranium supply? MF: Not to a large degree. The US nuclear industry is committed to working with the US Department of Energy on a long-term strategy for appropriate disposition of its uranium inventory. In general, because of the shutdown of Japanese reactors and Germany’s plans to shut down all of its nuclear plants, there is a surplus amount of uranium available in inventory. Also, Canada is fully operating some of its uranium mines. So, I believe that the US will continue to be a minor supplier of uranium until demand picks up elsewhere or supply from other sources decreases.Also, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is looking into new regulations on in-situ mining which we are hoping will come out better than initially proposed. We are working with the EPA to ensure that the proposed rules, which concern regulating by-product materials above and below ground with a primary focus on groundwater protection during in-situ uranium mining, are reasonable and appropriate.

            "In his first public speech since being named NRC chairman, Mr Burns said the NRC’s planned 2016 budget proposes a reduction of 140 “full-time equivalent” employees and an overall reduction in funding of $27.3 million (€23.9 million) from 2015.He said NRC staff had begun drawing up plans to “plan and executive the agency’s mission more efficiently” while adapting to a dynamic environment.He said the so-called ‘Project AIM 2020’ had “high-level” goals including the streamlining of the NRC, attracting the retaining the right staff, and executing its regulatory functions and making decisions “in a more timely and effective manner”. “When external conditions change, the NRC must respond more promptly in an agile and flexible manner,” Mr Burns said.He said a copy of the ‘Project AIM 2020’ report will be made public soon, and would represent a serious effort by the agency’s senior management to address challenges head-on. He warned that the report would contain “a number of provocative and potentially impactful recommendations”.Mr Burns said another potential “turning point” for the NRC will be in the application of new and advanced nuclear technologies. He said small modular reactors and advanced reactor technologies are coming to the forefront as the US seeks more innovative solutions to the technical issues associated with nuclear power. “As the regulator of such technologies, and as an agency that gets 90 percent of its budget from licensee fees, in my view, the NRC is in a challenging position to address the questions regarding the proper regulatory framework for such new technologies.”Mr Burns, a 33-year veteran of the NRC, has been chairman since 1 January 2015.

            "The report, ‘Energy Policies of IEA Countries: The United States – 2014’, calls on the US to finalise loan guarantees for existing new build and consider extending tax credits beyond the existing limit of six gigawatts and the end date of 2020.The US must “pursue faster routes to market” for small modular reactors (SMRs), working with industry and the national laboratories to tackle the technology and fabrication challenges. The report urges the government to work with the regulatory authorities to provide greater regulatory certainty for licensing and establishing security requirements for SMRs.The report also says the US, which according to the International Atomic Energy Agency has 99 commercial reactors in operation, must maintain momentum to reach an agreement on a policy and a strategy for implementing a solution to spent fuel and high-level waste disposal. “A process for vigorously pursuing the establishment of a deep geological disposal should be a high priority, since this is a key element in ensuring public confidence in nuclear power.”The report says during 2013, the greatest commercial challenges to the continued operation of the nuclear energy industry have included the low price and relatively high availability of natural gas from shale deposits; slow economic growth and weak national economy; slow growth in overall electricity demand.The US has been a leader in nuclear technology since the early days of civilian nuclear power and has “a mature industry and a mature regulatory environment”. Nuclear provided 19 percent of electricity generation in 2013, the report says.But the report says the loss of four reactors has led to the first significant decline in nuclear capacity for many years, while many other reactors are moving into extended lifetime operation and only five new reactors are under construction. This will ultimately lead to further fleet reductions. “As a result of the advent of shale gas, the US nuclear industry is at a pivotal point as a consequence of declining economic competitiveness,” the report says.In most countries that use it, the case for nuclear is made on arguments of security of supply, decarbonisation of the electricity sector and affordable electricity. Within the US, with the growing share of renewables and the availability of cheap gas and coal, security of supply is not a key driver. Construction of new reactors at Vogtle and Summer can play a key role in the future of the US nuclear industry. If they succeed within reasonable time and budget, then there are other similar regulated markets where the model could be applied.The report is on sale at the IAEA Bookshop.

            "JanuarySouth Korea’s nuclear regulator approved the restart of three reactors (Shin-Kori-2 and Shin-Wolsong-1 and -2). The units had been shut down in May 2013 after it was discovered that documentation related to cabling had been falsified. South Korea also approved a US$ 7 billion project for the construction of two new APR1400 units at Shin Kori. Construction of the units was scheduled to start in September 2014, but no announcement has been made.The Japan Atomic Industry Forum said restart permits from the regulator had been requested for 16 of the country’s 50 reactor units. Inspections need to to determine whether the units comply with new safety standards adopted in June 2013.Hungary’s government signed an agreement with Russian state-controlled nuclear energy corporation Rosatom that will see Rosatom build two new reactor units at Hungary's Paks nuclear power station. In Germany, a court decided in a case brought by German utility RWE that the forced shutdown of the two-unit Biblis nuclear plant after the 2011 accident at Fukushima-Daiichi had been illegal.February Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) said it was making progress on the decommissioning of the Fukushima-Daiichi power station. Tepco said it was continuing the safe removal of nuclear fuel from the storage pool of Unit 4 and it was making improvements to its management of contaminated water, including improvements to storage tanks, some of which had been leaking.Brazil’s government awarded a US$ 1.5 billion contract for the completion of the primary and secondary systems of Angra-3. Argentina’s regulator confirmed construction had officially started for the country’s prototype small modular reactor, Carem-25.In Europe, the European Commission laid out its objections to proposed state aid for the UK’s Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. The EC said the arguments used in favour of aid were “doubtful” or “not supported” by information. French nuclear vendor Areva reported that its 2013 losses on the Olkiluoto-3 nuclear new-build project in Finland were €425 million up from €400 million in 2012.MarchA US Government Accountability Office report concluded that the Fukushima-Daiichi accident led to many nuclear regulatory bodies taking steps to strengthen nuclear safety and provide additional resources for regulators. The report reviewed 16 countries, 13 of which operate commercial nuclear power reactors and three of which were developing or considering developing civilian nuclear power programmes.Differences in safety culture between Tokyo Electric Power Company and Tohoku Electric Power Company led to the meltdowns at Tepco’s Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power station in the aftermath of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, while Tohoku’s Onagawa nuclear station was “remarkably undamaged,” a report said.The Doel-3 and Tihange-2 nuclear reactor units in Belgium were shut down after tests related to the reactor pressure vessels (RPVs) showed “unexpected results”, operator Electrabel said. The “increasingly clear” effects of climate change will exacerbate poverty and food shortages worldwide, increasing risk of war, and may lead to extinction of some species, the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report said. The draft report warned that the nature of the risks of climate change is increasingly clear, though climate change will also continue to “produce surprises”.AprilCzech utility CEZ cancelled the tender to build two new reactor units at the Temelín nuclear station in the Czech Republic, blaming the European Union’s failure to clearly define long-term parameters for energy policy.Cancer levels are likely to remain stable in the wake of the Fukushima-Daiichi nccident and there will be no increase in the rates of birth defects, a UN report said. The report, by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (Unscear), said “no discernible changes in future cancer rates and hereditary diseases are expected” due to exposure to radiation as a result of the accident.The installed capacity of nuclear reactor units in commercial operation and under construction in China is expected to double to around 88 gigawatts by 2020, state news agency Xinhua reported.MayChina’s Ningde-2 nuclear unit in Fujian province began commercial operation on 4 May. Another CPR-1000 unit, Hongyanhe-2, began commercial operation on 13 May, bringing the number of commercially operational units in China to 21.Japan’s Toshiba Corporation said it will invest £200 million in a nuclear power station to be built at Moorside, in Cumbria, northwest England. Toshiba agreed with GDF Suez of France and Iberdrola of Spain to take a stake in NuGeneration Limited, the UK-based nuclear energy company which plans to build three Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear reactors at Moorside.Florida Power & Light was given permission by Florida state for the construction of two new Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear reactor units at the Turkey Point nuclear power station south of Miami. Turkey Point -6 and -7 are expected to be completed in 2022.JuneA revised nuclear safety directive for Europe was approved. The revised directive introduced EU-wide nuclear safety objectives that aim to limit the consequences of a potential nuclear accident as well as address the safety of the entire lifecycle of nuclear installations, including on-site emergency preparedness and response.The Hungarian parliament approved a loan agreement signed with the Russian government in March 2014 for the financing of two new units at the Paks nuclear station. The loan agreement is for €10 billion.The Russian BN-800 Beloyarsk-4 fast neutron reactor achieved first criticality. The sodium-cooled reactor, which burns mixed uranium-plutonium fuel, is part of Russia’s programme for developing Generation IV nuclear technology.The French government published an energy transition bill outlining its intention to reduce the nuclear share in electricity production from 75 percent today to 50 percent by 2025.JulyJapan’s nuclear regulator said two reactors at the Sendai nuclear station met new safety standards and could be restarted.Ukraine’s state nuclear operator Energoatom and Holtec International signed an agreement for the construction of a centralised repository for spent nuclear fuel at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. The repository will store spent nuclear fuel from the country’s Russian-built VVER reactors.Russia and Argentina signed a bilateral agreement that could lead to Russia building two nuclear power reactors in Argentina.Canada’s Candu Energy signed an “exclusive and binding” agreement with China Nuclear Power Engineering Company for the construction of two Candu reactors at the Cernavoda nuclear station in Romania. AugustWestinghouse Electric Company signed an agreement for the construction of a single AP1000 reactor unit at the Kozloduy nuclear power station in Bulgaria. Westinghouse said the agreement could see the new reactor, Kozloduy-7, in commercial operation by 2023.EDF Energy shut down two reactors at the Heysham A nuclear power station and two reactors at the Hartlepool nuclear station after a possible defect was detected on the spine of one boiler at Heysham A unit 1 (Heysham A-1). Belgium’s Doel-4 was shut down after more than 65,000 litres of lubricant oil leaked from the steam turbine, located on the secondary, non-nuclear side of the unit, through an open drain valve into an underground tank designed to hold the oil in case of fire. The local police suspected an act of sabotage and began an investigation. China’s Generation III ACP-1000 nuclear plant, also known as Hualong One, passed a review that will allow it to be exported. A committee of 43 experts agreed that the 1,150-megawatt meets all the safety requirements for Generation III technology.The concrete basemat was completed for the Tokamak complex of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (Iter) fusion reactor project under construction at Cadarache in southern France. SeptemberAreva said construction of the Olkiluoto-3 nuclear reactor in Finland will be completed in mid-2016 with commissioning starting at the same time and commercial operation now scheduled for 2018, putting the reactor about nine years behind its original schedule.China and Argentina signed an agreement that could lead to detailed contracts for the construction in Argentina of a US$6 billion Candu-6 reactor that will be known as Atucha-3. China National Nuclear Corporation will provide equipment and services for the 800-megawatt unit and capital will come from Chinese investment funds.Demand for uranium will continue to rise in the foreseeable future, despite declining market prices since the Fukushima-Daiichi accident in Japan in March 2011 and lower electricity demand as a result of the global economic crisis, a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Energy Agency said. The report predicts that world nuclear electricity generating capacity is expected to increase between seven per cent on the low and 82 per cent on the high side by 2035The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a rule to certify GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s Economic Simplified Boiling-Water Reactor (ESBWR) nuclear reactor design for use in the US.Russia and South Africa signed an intergovernmental agreement that laid the foundations for the construction of up to eight new nuclear units in South Africa.OctoberThe European Commission approved a modified state aid package for the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset, paving the way for construction to begin on the first nuclear reactors in the UK in almost 25 years. The EC said revised UK plans to subsidise the construction and operation by EDF Energy of two 1,600 megawatt EPR units at Hinkley Point were “in line with EU state aid rules”.The European Commission and European fusion research laboratories launched a joint programme with an initial budget of €850 million that will ensure “significant progress” along the path towards the realisation of fusion energy, the EC said.In Japan, local assembly members voted to approve the restart of the two-unit Sendai nuclear station in Japan after it became the first nuclear facility to meet revised safety standards imposed after the March 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi accident.The nuclear industry in the US renewed a call for “a more comprehensive nuclear fuel management system” that includes the development of centralised temporary storage while the licensing process for a deep geologic repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada continues.NovemberThe European Union announced a €315 billion investment plan which will help “remove the fear factor” from high-risk and high-capital investments including those in energy and energy networks. The plan would identify projects that will benefit from investment, the EC said.China’s Fuqing-1 Generation II+ CPR-1000 pressurised water reactor unit in Fujian province entered commercial operation, becoming the 22nd unit in commercial operation in China.Global installed nuclear capacity could almost treble to as much as 1,092 gigawatts electric by 2050 with countries considering new nuclear build because of concerns about climate change, high fossil fuel prices, price volatility and security of supply, the International Atomic Energy Agency said.The nuclear energy industry needs to be ready to manage “an unprecedented rate” of decommissioning with almost 200 of the 434 reactors that were operating commercially at the end of 2013 to be retired by 2040, a report by the International Energy Agency said.Russia and Iran signed an agreement for the construction of up to eight new nuclear reactor units in Iran.The governor of Japan’s Kagoshima Prefecture approved the restart of the Sendai-1 and -2 nuclear reactor units after they became the first in the country to meet new safety standards imposed after the March 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi accident.DecemberThe production of the most widely used medical radioisotope, molybdenum-99 (Mo-99), depends largely on a small number of reactors that are ageing and facing unplanned outages, refurbishment outages or permanent shutdowns, increasing the risk of disruption to the supply chain, a joint declaration signed by 11 countries said. The declaration said new infrastructure needs to be developed to replace these facilities before they shut down.The UK government should work with industry to better understand the economics of small modular reactors and set out “a clear explanation” of the conditions under which they might become cost competitive and commercially viable in the UK, a report said.Major nuclear energy projects were included in a list of priority investments that could be financed as part of a €315 billion investment plan outlined by European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. Among the projects on the list were three nuclear new build projects in the UK (Hinkley Point C, Moorside and Wylfa), as well as Poland's first nuclear power plant construction programme.The Finnish Parliament approved plans by Fennovoima to build the Hanhikivi-1 nuclear plant at Pyhäjoki, with Fennovoima saying commercial operation is scheduled in 10 years. The approval carried the condition that at least 60 percent of the shares in the project must be under Finnish ownership.China’s Fangjiashan-1 CPR-1000 pressurised water reactor unit in Zhejiang province officially entered commercial operation, becoming the 23rd nuclear unit in commercial operation in China."

            "17 Dec (NucNet): The UK government should work with industry to better understand the economics of small modular reactors (SMRs) and set out “a clear explanation” of the conditions under which they might become cost competitive and commercially viable in the UK, according to a new report.",
            "The report, by Parliament’s energy and climate change committee, says it will be important to understand the future cost comparison with large-scale nuclear reactors as well as the comparison with other small-scale energy generation.The report says: “Small modular reactors could potentially have a key role to play in delivering low carbon energy at lower upfront capital cost compared to large conventional nuclear reactors.  That said, the commercial viability of SMRs remains unclear.”The report points to potential barriers to deployment of SMRs in the UK and says those barriers are similar to those of deploying larger conventional reactors, including capital cost, lead times, uncertainty over both of these factors, regulatory approvals, and potential volatility in political and social support.Deployment of SMRs is likely to be achieved through sharing the costs between the public and private sector, the report says. The committee said it would like to see the government “steering industry towards deploying a demonstrator SMR in the UK”. The committee called for the government to help establish the right conditions for investment in SMRs, for example through supporting the regulator to bring forward approvals in the UK, and by setting out a clear view of siting options. “It might take six years to give regulatory approval (including a site-specific licence) for a small modular reactor.”In the longer term, the government should identify and help to establish future sources of commercial finance for the further development and industrialisation of SMRs, the report says. “While current SMR designs have been predominantly developed outside the UK, there is scope for British industry to develop intellectual property and play a role in the deployment of the first SMRs.”The report says SMRs are designed in a way that allows them to be manufactured at a plant and brought to site fully constructed. They have a range of applications, including industrial process heat, desalination or water purification, and other cogeneration applications.The report is online: http://bit.ly/1391jCe"

Proposed SMR designs are a fraction of the size of most current reactors, raising the question of how the new designs can best address emergency planning concepts, the NRC said. Nuclear power station emergency preparedness lays out plans for the station operators, as well as state and local authorities, to recommend public protective actions within 10 miles (16km) of a station in the event an accident releases radioactivity to the environment."

            "The plan, which covers fiscal years 2014-2018, sets new strategic objectives and describes strategies needed to meet new challenges affecting nuclear regulations. These challenges include processing licence applications for new technologies such as small modular reactors and continuing to implement improvements to reactor safety based on insight from the 2011 nuclear accident at Fukushima-Daiichi.Continuous monitoring of “the threat environment” is another regulatory duty that the NRC considered in preparing its plan. The plan considers changing economic conditions in the energy market affecting current and planned applications to build and operate new nuclear facilities or decommission existing ones.The NRC regulates 100 commercial nuclear power plants, 31 research and test reactors, and about 4,600 licensed reactor operators. It also regulates the US Department of Energy’s activities associated with a potential high-level waste repository.

            "17 Jun (NucNet): Donald Hoffman, outgoing president of the American Nuclear Society (ANS), talks to NucNet about the economics of nuclear energy in the US, the role of SMRs and the need for “fair and appropriate” 123 Agreements.",
            "NucNet: How do you see the economics of the US nuclear programme, particularly with regard to current shutdowns and new-builds?DH: You have to consider the geographical location of some of these nuclear plants and the environment in which they exist. The single-unit Kewaunee station, which shut down in May 2013, for example, operated in an unregulated market and what you see is that the low price of natural gas makes nuclear uncompetitive. In addition, in the US we do not have a level playing field – we subsidise solar and wind power. Do not get me wrong, ANS believes in renewable energy like solar and wind power. We just believe that all environmentally friendly forms of energy should be subsidised, or none should. In some cases, we are being forced to use intermittent sources because legislation says we must give renewables preferential access to the grid when we should be using nuclear baseload production. This results in nuclear being taken down from 100 percent to 90 or 85 or even 80 percent, which is the most inefficient level of operation of a nuclear power plant. So, we have the competitive aspects of not receiving subsidies and being forced to buy energy which is not competitive, and forcing our most competitive sources to be utilised inefficiently.Taking this into account, and going back to the example of Kauwanee, if it was anywhere else in the US, especially the southeast, it would continue to operate. The owner and operator of the plant, Dominion Generation, has said this clearly; the plant had undergone technical specifications, design basis licence renewal and an extended power uprate. This plant was ready to operate for at least another 20 years. But, because it is in a state with an unregulated market, its continued operation was not economically viable.This is why the ANS, together with the Nuclear Energy Institute, the utilities, and the state and federal governments, are working towards the establishment of a nuclear plant asset programme. This means that the federal government will recognise that when these nuclear plants were developed many years ago, it took six to eight years to design them, licence them and put them into operation at a cost of several hundred million dollars. Today, the time-frame is the same, but the cost is billions of dollars. We believe that this makes nuclear plants into assets that the federal government should not allow to be shut down simply because at this particular time and place they are not economically viable.NucNet: How is the development of small modular reactors progressing?DH: We continue to move forward. There is recognition in the US that SMRs are an ‘augment’, and not able to replace large nuclear power plants. They are an addition to large builds because they have unique applications. Internationally, they have unique applications because there are some grids which do not have the capability to handle a 1,000 megawatt plant, but people want nuclear as a part of their energy mix.In the US there are several applications. One is for military purposes. Some military installations only need a small amount of energy, but they need a secure supply of electricity which is removed from potential problems with the grid, terrorist attacks or natural events. However, another unique application is that many of our coal-fired power plants are old and we have to make a decision as to whether or not they will continue to operate. But new Environmental Protection Agency guidance related to emissions standards is so horrendous that the cost of upgrading many of these plants will amount to 75 or 100 million dollars or more. In this context, upgrading a coal-fired plant might not make sense when you could have a nuclear facility in that range of several-hundred megawatts. NucNet: What is your view on the US nuclear sector’s international presence?DH: The 123 Agreements that the US makes with other countries, based on Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act, are related to non-proliferation. These agreements make sure there are treaties between the countries that recognise the use of nuclear science technology. The 123 Agreements are also a mechanism through which we establish agreements related to whether or not a country has the right to enrich and reprocess uranium. Recently, the United Arab Emirates gave up its right to enrich and reprocess uranium. As a result, a number of countries and industry actors thought this should be the ‘gold standard’ and that everyone should do the same.  ANS does not believe that a country should necessarily give up its right to enrich and reprocess. We believe that each country has the right to act responsibly related to its use of nuclear science and technology. Therefore, if the country decides to maintain its right, we ask that it does not use that right unless it really has to.At ANS, the way we are trying to address this issue is to establish a world bank for uranium. This would make uranium available and keep prices affordable. Countries would not have to enrich and reprocess.Some countries are pointing out that they are not allowed to conduct enriching and reprocessing activities while their neighbours are. This is something that is going on between South Korea and Japan. In Vietnam there was a similar situation, so we petitioned the government to understand that the 123 Agreement should not be overly-restrictive. We think we should establish the right protocols and regimes to ensure that nations can conduct business in the appropriate manner. It is impossible to create a completely level playing field, but I think that the US is attempting to be responsible. NucNet: Would you like to see a reform of how these agreements are enacted?DH: I would not only like to see them change the time-frame, since one agreement takes about two years to be finalised, but also some of the rigidity that seems to be insisted on being maintained.The U.S. needs to be cautious not to give up the opportunity to be collaborative with the world just because this is a topic we do not want to deal with.NucNet: How many of the units being built in the US are on schedule and on budget and how important is it that they are?DH: If you look at what is important for new-build, if you cannot meet the budget or schedule that you have established then you will lose all credibility and integrity. It is important to be realistic about what we can and cannot do. We have to meet our commitments, which is why it is better to establish a longer time-frame in the schedule and to achieve everything ahead of schedule than to be aggressive and to not meet the schedule. People do not want to hear excuses – all they want to hear is that you are on schedule and on budget. There have been some schedule and budget issues at Vogtle, as well as some at V.C. Summer, but to a lesser extent. Some people argue that these units are our first nuclear new builds in 30 years and we have some things to learn. I do not think this is correct because if there were things to be learned we should have already learned them. While I expect there to be some minor problems, I do not expect delays of more than six months or even years. The situation at Watts Bar unit 2 is completely different because we are trying to complete a unit that started being built when the first one came online in 1987. However, it has also had some budget and schedule problems. None of these have had a significant impact though. The whole world is watching to see what is happening at Olkiluoto-3 and Flamanville-3, as well as in China, in order to see what lessons can be learned from their new build projects. In the US we have the documentation of all the units being built in the country up until the time that we had 104 operational reactors. We are looking to add to that documentation with the lessons being learned from the construction going on today. It is my hope that we will learn from those lessons and the issues that came up with Vogtle-3 will not be repeated at Vogtle-4. I think this will be the case in the end and I believe this will make the next builds even better. NucNet: As ANS president for the past year, what aspects of the US nuclear industry have you tried to change?DH: I set up 12 initiatives and two overarching activities. One of the initiatives is that we want to make ANS the society of choice for all nuclear science and technology professionals within the US. The other 11 initiatives lead up to this goal. There are things such as strategic planning, improving membership, extending our relevance and collaboration with federal and state governments, and improving the working of ANS staff. We also want to improve funding mechanisms for the Centre for Nuclear Science and Technology Information and continuing our communication activities. There is an initiative for the improvement of our financial means to make sure we have predictability and stability. Of course, we also want to improve our international cooperation.BackgroundDonald Hoffman is the 59th president of the American Nuclear Society. He founded EXCEL Services Corporation in 1985 to provide professional services to nuclear utilities in licensing and regulatory support and technical specifications. Mr Hoffman is also president of the pro-nuclear organisation Eagle Alliance. Mr Hoffman served in the US Navy as a senior submarine reactor operator and engineering officer, and as branch chief and lead reviewer at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission."

            "10 Jun (NucNet): Milo Alani, chairman of the European Young Generation Network, says the nuclear industry has been too conservative for too long and needs to ‘adapt to new conditions’.",
            "NucNet: As chairman of the European YGN, what is your view of the nuclear energy sector today?MA: Sometimes at the YGN we feel frustrated because the norms and values of the industry in general collide with those of the young generation. This is due to the generation gap which exists in our sector. The businesses have tried to overcome that gap and to close it, but I think we have not been successful. It comes down to the nature of the nuclear sector – it is conservative and highly criticised, which leads to businesses trying to shield themselves from the outside world. This has made us somewhat less creative. We do not tend to think outside the box and sometimes I feel like we are stuck in an age that is not aligned with today’s values. NucNet: What is the solution to these problems?MA: In the past two or three years, there has been increased interest from businesses and working groups in knowing what it takes to recruit people to the sector from our, younger, age-group, and also to keep them. When the young generation gets invited to speak at working groups, I always say we should think about the situation from a wider perspective. The decision-makers in our business belong to the generation of our parents. They tell us that we should sit down in the office and gain 20-30 years of experience and only then will they listen to what we have to say. I am exaggerating, but it illustrates my point. This creates a friction between my generation’s values and those of the decision-making generation.NucNet: What do you think about education and training initiatives by international organisations aimed at bridging the gap between the generations?MA: I think these programmes are great. The problem is that, for example, the International Atomic Energy Agency is an organisation and academia is an interface point, but these two are usually not aligned with the industry. The industry is everyday life; it is where you go to work. The IAEA, academia and policy-making are another level and this level is not aligned to the needs of the industry. Such organisations can have programmes and initiatives, but they should align themselves.NucNet: Do you think the young generation is often forgotten or overlooked?MA: Yes. This goes hand-in-hand with the industry’s situation. If you rewind to 40 or 50 years, the nuclear industry was sexy, new and hip. It was also protected by governments. The people who were trained and hired at the time did not have to think about market share, competition or surviving in a market environment. All public relations, human resources and public opinion were dealt with by the government. The only thing these people had to concentrate on was doing their work.Suddenly, after the Chernobyl accident, most of Europe and the West deregulated their energy markets. Most states sold their shares in the nuclear energy business and all these people who had been protected had to act in order to survive. The young generation is often forgotten because of this situation. A company acting in today’s world has quarterly economic and financial reports which create short-term thinking. Without long-term thinking, for the next 40 or 60 years, the young generation becomes overlooked.If you look at other sectors, like the motor industry, businesses have competed for many years and have adapted to the market. The nuclear sector is still adapting to these new conditions, but we will get there in the end. In the meantime, we are taking heavy blows because it is a tough transition. The nuclear sector is competing with fossil fuel companies which have had to compete in the market for a long time. This process takes time.NucNet: What are the prospects for a young person studying nuclear engineering at the moment?MA: The prospects are great. There are many job opportunities. The problem is not hiring people, but keeping them. We usually lose people after three to five years. This happens because young people lose interest. They cannot see the next steps in their career because there is no clear career path. Also, some people become frustrated with the friction I mentioned earlier – the conservative mentality and not being open to the public. I would be proud my company sponsored, for example, a football team. But this does not happen because companies in the nuclear sector do not tend to speak out beyond what they do. This makes them look like they are not proud of what they do.NucNet: As young generation president, what is the main challenge you have to deal with?MA: A few years ago the young generation had an identity crisis. We needed to define exactly what we are. Are we lobbyists, or are we promoters? We were not sure what kind of message we wanted to send out. At the time, I thought to myself that we represent a group and we should speak up about what this group wants. So, we listed topics which are important to us like increasing the number of women in the nuclear industry or increasing the number of young people in important decision-making positions. Now we are going to take another step and challenge industry to be more transparent.There was a Nuclear Industry Summit in March in Amsterdam and when they took the picture of participants I could count only four or five women. The industry was proud of that picture, while I would not be proud of it. Nevertheless, I understand that engineering in general in the world of 50 years ago was not appealing to women. Today there are many who consider a career in the sector. We should take these women in.NucNet: How is the European Nuclear Society supporting your efforts?The European YGN, as part of ENS, receives funds for its operations from ENS. We have also very recently negotiated to have a young person sit on the ENS High Scientific Council and have our own web page separate from that of ENS. We will have a blog on our new web page through which we want to inform the public about nuclear energy in a very simple language. For example, the president of the High Scientific Council supports the idea of having a list of myths about nuclear energy and we will allow the Council to explain them in simple terms. It is not sufficient to say that radiation is dangerous. This needs to be explained so we can build transparency and credibility. We are also active of Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. We are doing a lot which is more appealing to the younger generation. It is very simple – if you can stand for what you do, it is going to be easy to explain it to your neighbour. It is easier to be part of the sector if you believe in what you are doing.NucNet: What is the theme of the International Youth Nuclear Congress (IYNC) 2014?MA: Usually, the themes and topics discussed at the IYNC are ones which are important for the Young Generation. They address the future of nuclear. This year, we will talk about operation and maintenance, Generation III reactors, small modular reactors and fusion. We will also talk about education and training, and human resources – as always during our conferences we will discuss the future of the sector. When it comes to the YGN, we always think about the future.BackgroundMilo Alani has been chairman of the European Young Generation Network since 2013. He graduated with an MSc in applied mathematics in Sweden and works for Westinghouse Electric Sweden.The European Young Generation Network was founded in 1994 in Sweden and became part of the European Nuclear Society in 1995. The YGN includes 24 countries.The International Youth Nuclear Congress will be held in Burgos, Spain, from 6 to 12 July 2014. There will be six technical tours, including visits to the Santa María de Garoña nuclear power plant and control room simulators at Tecnatom, Madrid. For details and registration: www.iync.org."

            "17 Apr (NucNet): A new concept for nuclear plants that would be built on floating platforms and automatically cooled by surrounding seawater could prevent an accident like the one at Fukushima-Daiichi in Japan, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have said.",
            "The new concept, which is being presented at a symposium on small modular reactors hosted by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, is modelled after those used for offshore oil drilling.The plant would be designed to be automatically cooled by the surrounding seawater in a worst-case scenario, which would “indefinitely prevent any melting of fuel rods”, or escape of radioactive material, MIT said.Jacopo Buongiorno, an associate professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT, said such plants could be built in a shipyard, then towed to their destinations up to 10 km offshore, where they would be moored to the seafloor and connected to land by an underwater electric transmission line.The concept takes advantage of two mature technologies: light-water nuclear reactors and offshore oil and gas drilling platforms. Using established designs minimises technological risks, Prof. Buongiorno said.Although the concept of a floating nuclear plant is not unique – Russia is in the process of building one on a barge – none have been located far enough offshore to be able to ride out a tsunami, Prof. Buongiorno said. A floating platform several kilometres offshore, moored in about 100 metres of water, would be unaffected by the motions of a tsunami and earthquakes would have no direct effect. The biggest issue that faces most nuclear plants under emergency conditions – overheating and potential meltdown, as happened at Fukushima-Daiichi, Chernobyl, and Three Mile Island – would be virtually impossible at sea.At the end of a plant’s lifetime, decommissioning could be accomplished by simply towing it away to a central facility, as is done now for the Navy’s carrier and submarine reactors. According to Prof. Buongiorno, the design could help to address practical construction issues that have tended to make new nuclear plants uneconomical. Shipyard construction allows for better standardisation, and the all-steel design eliminates the use of concrete, which is often responsible for construction delays and cost overruns.There are no particular limits to the size of such plants, Prof. Buongiorno said. They could be anywhere from small 50-megawatt plants to 1,000-MW plants matching today’s largest facilities.

            "7 Mar (NucNet): UK members of parliament on the Energy and Climate Change Committee have announced a new inquiry into “small nuclear power” and are calling for written submissions of evidence.",
            "The committee said small reactors – which it defined as below 300 megawatts – potentially have many useful applications, including electricity generation and industrial process heat, desalination or water purification, and co-generation applications, such as in the petrochemical industry. Their small size and potential for modular construction may allow some new small reactors to be built in a controlled factory setting and installed module by module, improving manufacturing efficiency and cost while reducing construction time and financing costs, the committee said.In its 2013 report, ‘Building New Nuclear: The Challenges Ahead’, the committee recommended that the Department of Energy and Climate Change monitor progress towards developing small nuclear reactors, so that the possibility of including these as part of the UK energy mix remains open. The government responded that ultimately it is a matter for developers and operators to decide what type of fuel and technology to propose for future reactor systems.The deadline for the submission of written evidence is 16 April 2014.

The result was “a rare outcome” in that the NRC inspection concluded with no findings, observations, violations, recommendations or non-conformances identified, NuScale said.NuScale is developing and testing computer code design analysis software to support the NRC design certification of its advanced light water small modular reactor (SMR) design. The NuScale design includes a first-of-a-kind HCSG for conversion of nuclear heat into process steam. NuScale contracted the services of SIET for the full-scale testing of the HCSG performance over the expected range of reactor operating conditions. SIET has extensive experience with similar heat exchanger test bundle fabrication and testing for other reactor vendors, NuScale said.In December 2013, NuScale was picked as the winner of the second round of funding for the US Department of Energy’s cost-sharing programme to develop SMR technology.As part of the award, NuScale will receive funding that will support the accelerated development of its NuScale Power Module SMR technology. NuScale and the DOE are negotiating an agreement that formalises the public-private relationship for the funding and establishes milestones for the five-year funding programme."

TerraPower says that by greatly simplifying the nuclear fuel cycle, TWRs could improve the cost, safety, social acceptability, and long-term sustainability of nuclear energy as a source of emissions-free electricity.Unlike B&W’s Generation III++ small modular reactor, mPower which is based on pressurised water reactor technology and standard fuel enriched to five percent, the TWR is a larger reactor based on Generation IV technology and designed to use depleted uranium as fuel."

            "“While there are other projects for similar reactors in the world, this is the first that has started to be built,” CNEA president Norma Boero said.Carem – the Central Argentina de Elementos Modulares – is a domestically designed and developed 25-megawatt small modular pressurised water reactor unit. CNEA said Argentina is investing about 63 million US dollars (about 46 million euros) in the project.The Carem-25 prototype is being built at a site next to the Atucha nuclear power station in Lima, about 100 km northwest of the capital, Buenos Aires.CNEA said the unit is scheduled to begin cold testing in 2016 and receive its first fuel load in 2017.Carem-25 uses passive safety systems and its entire primary coolant system is contained within the single self-pressurised vessel and uses free convection to circulate the coolant. This eliminates the need for devices such as pumps within the primary circuit and decreases the extent and complexity of the piping system. According to CNEA, it also reduces the possibility of accidents involving a loss of coolant.CNEA said once the Carem-25 design is proven, a larger 100 to 200-MW version will be built in the northern province of Formosa."

            "6 Feb (NucNet): Any situation in which the hasty construction of a new nuclear power station takes precedence over careful development of a robust domestic safety infrastructure is of great concern, US Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman Allison Macfarlane has said.",
            "Ms Macfarlane told the Platts Nuclear Energy Conference in Washington DC that an effective, independent regulator is essential – and should be established at the outset – before any decisions are made about sites or reactor designs. She warned against possible political pressure to establish a nuclear power programme without an independent, well-funded, open and transparent regulatory body. “Whether the programme would bring much-needed electricity, water desalination, regional or domestic prestige, or other benefits, some countries have put nuclear power on a fast track.”The International Atomic Energy Agency’s guidance for countries considering nuclear power stipulates that an independent regulatory infrastructure must be in place, along with other critical infrastructure, before bids are invited, she said. Ms Macfarlane said the Fukushima-Daiichi accident of March 2011 heightened the focus on nuclear safety and reminded everyone that accidents have global consequences.While Fukushima-Daiichi was a catalyst for some countries’ decisions to cease nuclear power operations or abandon pursuit of a future nuclear programme, quite a few countries are moving forward with their plans – and many of these are new players, Ms Macfarlane said.“Future development of small modular reactors may create a nuclear power option for additional countries that may not have the ability to support larger plants. Many of these countries lack basic critical infrastructure – from a sufficient power grid to the laws necessary to underpin a programme’s safe operation.”As the most important factor for a regulator, she said “a regulator must have confidence that its decisions will not be overturned for political reasons”."

            "The report, the result of expert workshops in Saskatoon and Toronto and an executive summit in Ottawa, says it is difficult to make the political case that public funds should be committed to large, expensive energy projects that may not come online for nearly a decade.Typically, investment costs of nuclear power plants account for around 60 percent of total project lifecycle costs, the report says.Despite the fact that nuclear power provides relatively cheap electricity with low fuel and low operational costs, the upfront investment will continue to play a significant role in decisions to build new plants, the report says. According to some workshop participants, government and business leaders need to explore new investment strategies that spread the financial risk and funding responsibilities among different stakeholders to overcome this obstacle. The future of the nuclear energy sector in Canada is dependent upon a number of key factors, particularly whether a business case can be made and new technologies can demonstrate long-term competitive economics, the report concludes.The report also proposes that Canada pursues opportunities to develop small modular reactors, strengthens its national laboratories and improves the engagement and transparency of its regulatory regime.The report is online: www.ppforum.ca/sites/default/files/Nuclear_Final_report_Jan_07_2014.pdf"

Project director Dr Hamid Aït Abderrahim spoke to NucNet about the technical specifications, the challenges and the opportunities.",
            "NucNet: What is the Myrrha project?HA: Myrrha is a large research infrastructure. It is based on a sub-critical reactor and is cooled with a liquid mixture of lead and bismuth. The reason for choosing this coolant is that we want a fast-spectrum irradiation facility. Using lead-bismuth as a coolant allows us to develop this type of critical or sub-critical reactor. Myrrha aims to demonstrate the concept of an accelerator-driven system. This means that the reactor is sub-critical and thus cannot sustain the chain reaction on its own. You need an externally driven neutron source in the centre of the reactor core to keep the fission chain-reaction going on. The neutron source is a heavy metal spallation target and driven by a proton beam. The beam is generated by a linear accelerator.Myrrha’s accelerator will produce a proton beam of up to four milli-amperes (mA) at an energy of 600 mega-electron Volts (MeV). We shoot the proton beam onto the liquid-metal spallation target, also a lead-bismuth mixture. In this way, we will generate the primary neutrons for starting and maintaining the chain reaction in the reactor by showering them onto the fuel element in the core.  If we switch off the accelerator, everything stops. That is the principle.The purpose of this machine is, first, to demonstrate the concept of accelerator-driven system (ADS) at a power of about 100 megawatts (MW) thermal. This is, I would say, the pre-industrial step towards the industrial-scale level. Second, we will be able to run experiments of transmutation of the high-level waste in this machine. Third, we can also demonstrate new types of innovative nuclear fuel for Generation IV reactors. If new types of fuel are developed for today’s Generation II or III reactors, we can also test those. Material research and production is also a topic we have considered as an application field. We have a harder spectrum, in terms of neutron energy, than other R&D reactors thanks to the spallation target technique. The hard neutrons will allow us to mimic the conditions in a fusion reactor and the impact of the hard neutron radiation on construction materials..Last but not least, we want to produce medical radioisotopes in the Myrrha system, as we are doing today in the BR2 experimental reactor at Mol. We are also going to work on the fabrication of neutron irradiated silicon for power electronics.NucNet: Will Myrrha replace the BR2?HA: Yes, Myrrha it will replace the BR2. However, it will have a larger portfolio of applications thanks to the fact that it is a sub-critical reactor coupled with an accelerator. As a plus, we also have the accelerator. We want to use this machine not only to drive Myrrha, but also to use a fraction of the beam to conduct more fundamental research. This is what we are calling ‘Isol at Myrrha’, which is similar to what there is at Cern – the Isolde. Our Isol system will operate continuously for long periods. This means we can carry out physics experiments with low-statistic rare events. NucNet: Why did you decide to use lead-bismuth as a coolant?HA: We chose lead-bismuth and not pure lead for a simple reason. The melting temperature of lead is 370 degrees Celsius (°C). If you take a mixture of lead and bismuth in the correct proportions, 55 percent lead and 45 percent bismuth, you will make what is called an eutectic. A lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) melts at 123 °C. The advantage of this difference in melting point is that the working temperature in the reactor does not have to be so high. Normally, we work at about 100 degrees above the melting point in order to be safe from the point where the coolant would freeze. If we use pure lead, this would mean an inlet temperature of about 470 °C to operate at about 100 degrees above freezing, and an outlet temperature of 570 °C.With lead-bismuth, we can afford to work an inlet temperature of 220 °C and 320 °C at the outlet. These are temperatures comparable to a modern pressurised water reactor. Temperatures also have an impact on the reactor’s internal structural materials. With lead-bismuth coolant we can use standard steel used in the rest of the nuclear industry. If we were using pure lead as a coolant, we would have to operate at a higher temperature and we would have to use materials capable of handling those higher temperatures.The real issue is corrosion. If we were to operate at a higher temperature, corrosion would become more important. By choosing lead-bismuth as a coolant, we can work at a lower temperature and limit problems related to corrosion.NucNet: Does using lead-bismuth make the reactor safer?HA: Compared to pure lead, there is no difference in terms of safety. Compared to other coolants – sodium, for example – lead-bismuth is safer. This is because of the chemical reactivity of water or water vapour, or even air, with sodium. Sodium exothermically reacts with water, but not lead or lead-bismuth. That is the advantage.Compared to gas, there is something else to consider. There is no reactivity between gas and air. But there is less efficiency in the thermal capacity of the gas. From that point of view, lead is safer. Also, from the point of view of shielding, lead is safer. When you shield yourself from radiation, you use lead. So, it is a very interesting medium for shielding purposes.NucNet: Is such a reactor being developed or built anywhere else in the world?HA: Yes. The first applications scientists thought about when they considered lead-bismuth reactors were for marine propulsion – in submarines or boats. The Russians were successful with the development of such a system. Their main issue was with corrosion, but they succeeded in controlling that. The US has also conducted a lot of research on this technology, but they never succeeded in controlling the corrosion problem. They abandoned the development of lead-bismuth units and decided to develop pressurised water reactors for their submarines.Lead-bismuth reactors were built by Russia in Obninsk and Nizhny Novgorod to demonstrate the capabilities of this technology and we now have access to the information about them.NucNet: How is the licensing process for Myrrha proceeding?HA: We should secure the licensing of Myrrha by the end of 2014. This means that we should have advanced the design of Myrrha and all the technology to a point where everything is supported by a research and development programme. This programme should show that these innovative or ‘risky’ points are feasible. NucNet: Are there any international partners in the project?HA: We have cooperated with a number of partners through the EU Framework Programme. There were projects on different components and aspects of Myrrha with partners from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Czech Republic, Portugal and the UK. We are now looking to another type of collaboration – partners to enter in the consortium for building the Myrrha. We have had discussions with Germany, the UK, France and Italy and with the European Commission about participation in Myrrha. We are also looking outside Europe, but we want to keep the European dimension of the project. We want about 70 percent of the project’s funding to be European. Beyond that, we are looking outside Europe, especially to Japan, where we have a very interesting ongoing discussion. We are also looking at South Korea, China and the US.NucNet: You said the Russians had done experiments with this technology before. Are they interested in participating?HA: We had a discussion with the Russians on the possibility of their joining the Myrrha project and they were very interested. They are thinking of building a small modular reactor based on lead-bismuth technology – the SVBR-100 reactor. They have a design, which is not that different from the Myrrha. They expressed interest in our project and discussions are continuing about their possible involvement. NucNet: Why did you decide to use mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for Myrrha?HA: In a fast reactor, you can use uranium-238 as a fuel, but you cannot put only depleted uranium into it. You need some fissile material to start with. Belgium has worked for a very long time with mixed-oxide uranium-plutonium fuel (MOX), so it is logical that we thought about using it. We have the data required for licensing this kind of fuel within our institution. This is the pragmatic approach we have decided to take.NucNet: What about possible problems with mercury or polonium as by-products of the Myrrha reactor?HA: There is indeed a problem when we bombard the spallation source with protons because it generates some mercury and this is a volatile product. The issue with polonium is a consequence of using a lead-bismuth coolant because bismuth can become polonium if it captures neutrons. Polonium is a radiotoxic product. The risk with these two by-products is that they can become a hazard when they are released. But we have already carried out experiments and tests with Myrrha on the behaviour of mercury and polonium. The issue is that we have to find a way to capture and contain them should they escape. The first experiment we carried out was to dissolve polonium in the liquid metal eutectic. It forms a metallic molecule with lead, which is called lead-polonide. This metallic molecule stays in the liquid metal mixture and is not released. Next, we examined what happens when a small amount is released  for any reason. The result was that less than one millionth of the produced polonium was released, or came free, and this only if water penetrated into the liquid metal. If polonium is released, it remains in the cover gas on top of the reactor, where other radioactive products accumulate. We trap these products in ‘cold traps’ and we have built a whole lab to address this issue. In this lab we have shown that the release is very small and that we can efficiently trap polonium our ‘cold traps’. That is whythis system will be built in Myrrha.

            "The company was responding to a Department of Energy announcement on 12 December 2013 that it had awarded funding for developing a small modular reactor design to the Oregon-based start-up NuScale.The DOE said it will invest up to half of the total project cost through a five-year cost-share agreement, with the project’s industry partners matching this investment by at least one-to-one. The specific total will be negotiated between the DOE and NuScale and will be derived from the total 452 million US dollars (329 million euros) identified for its small modular reactor licensing technical support programme.The 45-megawatt NuScale Power Module was initially developed in 2000 and has been demonstrated and in testing programmes since 2003, NuScale said.Reacting to the DOE’s announcement, Holtec president and chief executive officer Kris Singh said Holtec’s proposal included the offer to refund all federal grant funding if the company failed to licence the reactor for commercial use. “While we are surprised that our proposal was not selected, Holtec is willing, ready and prepared to achieve success without federal funding and our team will redouble its efforts to achieve a Nuclear Regulatory Commission licence.”The DOE said its funding will help NuScale obtain NRC design certification and achieve commercial operation “around 2025”."

            "21 Nov (NucNet): The US-based company is hoping a successful bid for two new units at Temelín would result in a more substantial role for the Czech Republic as the AP1000 reactor design is deployed globally, says Pavel Janík, president of Westinghouse Czech Republic.",
            "NucNet: How is the tender process for two new units at Temelín progressing?PJ: The tender process is a fair and transparent one. The vendor could be chosen by the end of the year or early next year, which has advantages for (state energy company) ČEZ and the Czech Republic. Technology selection will help ČEZ understand the costs and the method of delivery. It will then be easier to determine the mechanisms needed to secure the investment and finalise all issues connected with financing.Westinghouse is looking at all opportunities for new nuclear in Europe. That means Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, the UK, Sweden and other countries. It would be good if we can start with the construction of new units at Temelín according to the original plan, in around 2017. Then the Czech Republic could become a Westinghouse ‘hub’ to serve these projects using synergies from the delivery of the Temelín project, including part of an established supply chain in the Czech Republic.NucNet: Do you think the two existing Russian VVER units at Temelín place the Westinghouse bid at a disadvantage?PJ: Quite the opposite. Westinghouse delivered the entire instrumentation and control (I&C) systems for Temelín-1 and -2, so we understand ČEZ´s procedures and the way they operate their plants.NucNet: So Westinghouse’s involvement in the construction of the two first units at Temelín is an advantage?PL: Yes, Westinghouse Czech Republic was formed 20 years ago to provide greater customer interface and to execute the Temelín-1 and -2 I&C upgrade project. Czech suppliers already provide Westinghouse with products and services for our nuclear fuel fabrication facilities and our customers needing advanced I&C systems upgrades in Europe. We are prepared to give the Czech industry a more substantial role as the AP1000 reactor design is deployed globally.NucNet:  In the Westinghouse bid for the two new units at Temelin, are you planning to use the same I&C systems as you delivered for the first two units?PJ: No, the AP1000 reactor uses an even more advanced, digital I&C system. It draws on more than 40 years of experience in light water reactor components and technology.NucNet: What are some of the key advantages of the AP1000?PJ: There are many features of the AP1000 that allow Westinghouse to say that this plant is a breakthrough. For example, the AP1000 is designed to minimise construction risks. The modular construction means many tasks can be carried out in parallel which reduces construction time and makes the process more predictable. The AP1000 is easier to build, maintain and operate, because it contains fewer components and only a small number of those require nuclear-grade certification. The plant has a smaller footprint compared to other standard PWR plants. Another important feature is standardisation, which means that the AP1000 can be built almost anywhere using local industry. And the AP1000 has a licensing pedigree in the form of existing approvals in the US and China, as well as being compliant with the European Utility Requirements (EUR), confirming that it can be used in Europe. NucNet:   Are there any innovations in the safety or operational efficiency of the Westinghouse design?PJ: The AP1000 includes both active and passive systems.  The active features, such as the chemical and volume control system and normal residual heat removal system, support day-to-day operations and provide a first line of defence in the event of fluctuations in plant conditions. These features work in a manner that is similar to the active safety systems used in existing PWRs.  The AP1000 also has fully passive systems which ensure safety if the active systems fail or if AC power is lost. These systems use natural forces such as gravity, evaporation and condensation, which never fail. The AP1000 is the first and only passive plant licenced by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. *NucNet: Is Westinghouse facing any problems in the Czech Republic?PJ: Westinghouse submitted a fully compliant and competitive bid to ČEZ to develop and deliver a turnkey dual-unit AP1000 plant. We believe the AP1000 offers four key benefits to ČEZ and the Czech Republic. Those benefits are unequalled safety, licensing and project certainty, a high degree of sustainable and regional localisation, and the diversification that comes from using a different type of reactor with fuel from a different source, in this case Westinghouse.NucNet: How do you view competition from Areva and the Russian-led MIR-1200 consortium?PL: The AP1000 addresses many of the key issues facing the nuclear industry in Europe. We believe it offers unequalled safety, licensing and project certainty, and sustainable localisation. In the end, certainty is what are customers are looking for when considering such a huge investment.* In the event of a design-basis accident such as a coolant pipe break the AP1000 is designed to achieve and maintain safe shutdown without any operator action and without the need for AC power or pumps. Instead of relying on active components such as diesel generators and pumps, the AP1000 relies on the natural forces of gravity, natural circulation and compressed gases to keep the core and containment from overheating. For details see: www.ap1000.westinghousenuclear.comBackgroundPavel Janík is president of Westinghouse Czech Republic. He is responsible for stakeholder relations and is engaged in all commercial negotiations, including the tender for units 3 and 4 of the Temelín nuclear plant. Mr Janík previously worked for ČEZ and was chairman of the board for ČEZ Bohunice. "

            "26 Jun (NucNet): The US will make continued progress in reducing pollution from fossil fuel power plants by leading the way in the development of clean energy technologies such as efficient natural gas, renewables, clean coal technology and nuclear, a climate action plan released by the White House says.",
            "The plan, unveiled yesterday in a speech by President Barack Obama, says there are “abundant clean energy solutions available” and by using them the US can make continued progress in reducing power plant pollution “to improve public health and the environment”. According to the plan, roughly 84 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in the US are energy-related and about 65 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to energy supply and energy use. It says power plants burning coal, oil and gas are the largest major source of emissions in the US, together accounting for roughly 40 percent of all domestic greenhouse gas pollution.The plan also includes proposals for the first-ever limits on carbon emissions from new and existing power plants.It says the US will continue to promote the “safe and secure” use of nuclear energy worldwide through a variety of bilateral and multilateral engagements. For example, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission advises international partners on safety and regulatory best practices, and the Department of Energy works with international partners on research and development, nuclear waste and storage, training, regulations, quality control, and comprehensive fuel leasing options. The plan says the US will expand these efforts to promote nuclear energy generation consistent with maximising safety and non-proliferation goals.Mr Obama’s fiscal year 2014 budget increases funding for clean energy technology by 30 percent to approximately 7.9 billion US dollars (six billion euros). This includes investment in a range of energy technologies, from advanced bio-fuels to clean coal and emerging nuclear technologies including small modular reactors.In a statement after Mr Obama’s speech, the US Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the nuclear energy industry, said there is no debating the fact that nuclear energy produces nearly two-thirds of carbon-free electricity in the US. The NEI said Mr Obama recognised this during the presidential campaign when he said, ‘It is unlikely we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option.’ Likewise, energy secretary Ernest Moniz supports the expansion of nuclear energy to meet national energy and environmental imperatives, the NEI said.The NEI statement said: “When it comes to reducing the US electric sector’s greenhouse gas emissions, efforts can succeed only if carbon-free nuclear energy plays a larger role in the nation’s electricity mix.”The Climate Action Plan is online:www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/image/president27sclimateactionplan.pdfFollow NucNet on Twitter @nucnetupdates"

            "The UK government yesterday published the report setting out its vision for the country’s nuclear industry and identifying the domestic new build and wider nuclear market as an essential platform to boost Britain's nuclear commercial base and increase global market share.The report outlines an industrial strategy to make UK “a leading civil nuclear energy nation” and says a new build programme alone could generate up to 40,000 new jobs.The report covers the whole of the nuclear market – new build, waste management and decommissioning, fuel cycle services, operations and maintenance.It says the government will provide 15 million pounds (GBP) (22 million US dollars, 17 million euro) for a new facility for universities and companies carrying out research into nuclear technology. The facility will have centres at the National Nuclear Laboratory at Sellafield, the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy in Oxfordshire and the University of Manchester’s Dalton Cumbrian Facility.The report says the UK will spend GBP 12.5 million to join the Jules Horowitz test reactor programme which is being constructed in France. The reactor will provide the UK with “a valuable radiation testing facility to develop future advance nuclear fuels”.In 2011, the government spent GBP 66 million on nuclear research and development and “will keep under review its level of future expenditure”. The report says the government is keen to explore opportunities to back future reactor designs, including the feasibility of launching a small modular reactor (SMR) R&D programme to ensure that the UK is a key partner of any new reactor design for the global market.The report is online:www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-innovation-skills/series/nuclear-industrial-strategyFollow NucNet on Twitter @nucnetupdates"

            "5 Feb (NucNet): US Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) president and chief executive officer Marvin Fertel talks to NucNet about the future of nuclear in the US, key energy policy issues and the importance of “staying standardised”.",
            "NucNet: What is the policy agenda for nuclear energy in the US for 2013 and beyond?MF: Most mainstream, independent analyses of the climate change issue conclude that nuclear energy must increase to meet rising electricity demand while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To succeed in this, the US must establish a comprehensive and sustainable national policy that supports the development of technology-based, zero-carbon solutions like nuclear energy, solar and wind. This policy must be implemented in the near term and be affordable for consumers. Herein lies the value of nuclear energy.As far as the nuclear industry and the NEI is concerned, there are three main issues that will continue to be our priorities in 2013. The first is to continue operating safely domestically by ensuring we take the lessons learned from Fukushima-Daiichi and incorporate them to make our plants safe. We also have to make sure we do that in a way that doesn’t overburden the operators of our sites.The second issue is continuing the progresses made building new nuclear plants. We have five nuclear reactors under construction and are going to see a number of plants coming online. They are Watts Bar in 2015, Vogte-3 in 2016, Vogtle-4 and Summer-2 in 2017, and Summer-3 in 2018.We have to ensure that these plants continue to make the good progress they are making, satisfying all the regulatory requirements, and that they come to operation according to the schedule.The third issue is the question of the Yucca Mountain repository.NucNet: What is the latest on Yucca Mountain?MF: The issue hasn’t been resolved yet. President Obama stopped activities at Yucca Mountain and formed the Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future, which submitted its final report to the Secretary of Energy last year. The Department of Energy [DOE] recently published an action plan for implementing some of the recommendations.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission [NRC] is expecting a decision from the US Court of Appeals on whether it should resume licensing for Yucca Mountain. The decision likely will be taken by the court in the first quarter of this year or very early in the second quarter.What we expect, on the basis of a decision issued by of the court last year, is that that the court will tell the NRC to resume licensing. And that’s what we’d like to see happening. We expect legislation from both the US House of Representative and the Senate during this congress. I am not sure exactly what is going to happen, but I believe at least the process concerning the legislation will get started.NucNet: The DOE recently announced plans for a full-scale temporary storage facility to open in 2025 and a permanent geological repository to be available by 2048. What legislation is needed in the near term to allow siting, design and licensing work to begin?MF: The action plan that the DOE published says congress needs to give the DOE the authority to go forward, to begin the process. The land proposed for the repository is still at Yucca Mountain. The proposed site hasn’t been changed and so far there is no legislation which allows for other repository sites to be looked at. We expect progress toward legislation from both houses during this Congress.NucNet: The successful construction of new plants depends on a robust supply chain. What is the position of US suppliers in the global market?MF: We have been working for a number of years to try to make sure that our domestic suppliers can participate in the international market. There are a number of so-called “123 agreements” [agreements for cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear energy] being negotiated which must be concluded for us to be able to export reactors and components. The NEI is trying to help get those agreements finalised, but domestically we have export control regulations that are overly complex and sometimes inefficient.  We have been working with the government to try to improve these regulations. Although the domestic market for new nuclear plants remains soft in the near-term, there are significant opportunities in the expanding global market. The US Department of Commerce estimates that the global nuclear energy market—including fuel and services—will expand to as much as $740 billion over the next 10 years. It estimates that every $1 billion of exports will create 5,000 to 10,000 American jobs. The US nuclear industry is looking to play very aggressively in the international market.NucNet:   Is the industry in the US worried by the apparent rise of China and Russia as competitors? Russia seems particularly intent on selling is reactors worldwide.MF: The competition is pretty fearsome across the world. Competing against Russia and China means competing against the countries themselves because they operate as countries, not as private sector firms. This makes it more difficult for our private sector firms. NucNet:  The DOE says US electricity demand will rise 22 percent by 2035, about one percent each year. What is your perception on that issue? MF: As we work our way out of the economic crisis, we are using of lot of electricity and providing baseload electricity is going to be fundamental.There is tremendous growth potential in America for electric vehicles and there is a lot of capital going into that and into electrification in general. For instance, we are electrifying a lot of our ports.  We see electrification being an important part of the future of America both for industrial applications and domestic use. Electricity demand will continue to grow, which is why we see nuclear as such an important part of the mix.Even with modest economic growth over the next two decades, the Energy Information Administration  forecasts a 28 percent increase in electricity demand by 2040. The US will need some 400 new, large power plants to meet increased 24/7 electricity demand and replace closed plants. Nuclear energy is the only large-scale source of clean electricity that can be expanded widely.NucNet:    One of the perceived problems with nuclear energy is that it has significant up-front costs that can deter potential investors. Do you see this cost issue as a problem for the industry and if so, what needs to be done to address it? Are market mechanisms needed similar to those being discussed in the UK?MF: We would like to see some measures being taken as they are in the UK, but I am not sure this will happen. I think what we can do from our side concerning the up-front costs of nuclear energy is to “stay standardised”. Standardisation will reduce the timeframe of the construction for nuclear power plants. We have 104 reactors and in general they are all customised. The two units being built at Vogtle and the two at Summer are standardised AP 1000 units. Staying standardised also means streamlining licensing because we have built these plants before and we have them certified. It means getting construction techniques improved because we have done it more than once. This would have a dramatic impact on the ultimate costs of building a new nuclear plant.From the licensing phase to the operational phase the time it takes to build a reactor like Vogtle is about 10 years.  This could be reduced to something between six-and-a-half and seven-and-a-half years. The strength of our energy system is using diverse technologies including renewables, coal, gas, and diversity of fuel. With growth in electricity demand likely to continue, diversity allows the state to ensure reliable supplies. A nuclear plant is always going to cost more up front than a gas plant, but a nuclear plant is a 60-year production facility and it operates 24/7. NucNet:  Is there a need to reduce the impact of layers of regulation on commercial reactors? MF: I think there is always the opportunity of improving the efficiency on the regulatory side and of making processes work better without undermining safety and the reliability. We are working with the NRC to reduce unnecessary burden and to reduce any uncertainty about regulations continuing to change.NucNet:   Do you think president Obama’s re-election will mean further developments for the nuclear sector in the US?MF: I think the president has been clear regarding his position on nuclear energy. He believes in a diversified energy mix, which includes nuclear energy. This is what is known as the “all of the above” approach. He spoke positively on nuclear energy during his first term.  After the accident at Fukushima-Daiichi, he said we need nuclear energy, we need to make sure that it is safe, but we do need it. The  president sees energy as an important sector that he wants to foster in his second term and I think he will support nuclear energy. He has spoken out about dealing with greenhouse gases and he clearly understands that nuclear energy is part of the solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. NucNet:   What is public opinion in the US on nuclear energy and what are the most significant concerns the public has? MF: Following the Fukushima-Daiichi accident, public opinion fell from 71 percent in favour of nuclear energy to 46 percent in favour, but it is now back to 64 percent, which is as good as it was in 2009.The operators of nuclear facilities, together with the NEI and the nuclear industry, are working to rebuild public trust by communicating publically about the safety of plants, the benefits of nuclear energy, and what we are doing to prevent accidents like Fukushima-Daiichi. We are going to continue that commitment.NucNet: What is the status of post-Fukushima-Daiichi safety measures in the US? What has been done and what still needs to be done?MF: The foundation of our response to the lessons learned from Fukushima-Daiichi is a comprehensive, tailored safety programme that we call FLEX*.  Essentially FLEX is an approach to implement the lessons learned from Fukushima-Daiichi and address NRC initial safety recommendations. FLEX builds on earlier safety steps by providing an effective and efficient way to make US nuclear energy facilities even safer.There are a number of key areas we are addressing in relation to what happened in Japan. We need to make sure we provide additional means to get water into the reactor vessel to cool the core, and get water into the fuel storage pools to make sure spent fuel stays cool.We learnt after the 9/11 terrorist attacks that we can’t prevent all situations, but at nuclear energy facilities we can be flexible enough to ensure that if something happens, then key systems won’t be lost.  Having portable safety equipment is a very important additional element for safety against extreme natural events. Since March last year, all our plants have had portable cooling equipment and there are other examples of new safety equipment on site such as backup generators, battery packs and pumps.  We are in the process of developing two regional response centres near Memphis and Phoenix. These are regional centres for critical equipment that could be sent to any nuclear power plant in the country to maintain safety in the event of an extreme event.The centres are capable of delivering supplemental emergency equipment to any of America’s nuclear energy facilities within 24 hours. That would provide facilities yet another resource to safely manage any loss of electrical power cooling water supply.Also, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations [www.inpo.info] has significantly enhanced an incident response centre that is robust. INPO will coordinate among all the sites to make sure that if they need equipment, INPO will coordinate the procurement of that equipment from other sites. We are in the process of satisfying NRC requests for information concerning new flood and seismic analyses and this work will be completed by the end of this year. The most important thing is to get this portable and diverse equipment on site, to train our people and to be ready for any type of event.  NucNet: What is the state of research in the US concerning the development of advanced nuclear reactors based on fast-neutron fission technology as well as small modular reactors (SMRs)?MF: One of the very few, perhaps even the only nuclear programme started last year, is the DOE joint programme with the industry on small modular reactors. The technology that has been chosen for federal funding is B&W’s mPower** design. B&W has been doing a lot of research into licensing and design for the last couple of years that will now be shared with the government. We are expecting to have another solicitation for SMR funding by the end of March and the DOE will select one more technology to go forward. We expect SMRs to be deployed in the US by the beginning of the next decade.NucNet: What do you think the future of holds for nuclear energy in the United States and globally?MF: I don’t advocate that you should only have nuclear energy or any particular type of fuel as a single source, but I believe that nuclear energy will continue to be a significant part of the energy mix. We expect to build more nuclear plants in the decades 2020 and 2030. Globally, the challenge is to make sure that as countries adopt the technology, they also have the correct infrastructure. It is important that countries with nuclear energy have robust and independent regulators, a strong supply chain and the right safety culture to operate their plants. The challenge is not only building a nuclear plant, but also having the rest of the infrastructure needed to make sure that it operates safely and reliably. America can play a leadership role in helping countries that are getting into this area, and do it the right way and the best way.Marvin Fertel is president and chief executive officer of the Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute. He has 35 years of experience consulting for electric utilities on issues related to designing, siting, licensing and managing both fossil and nuclear plants. In November 1990, he joined the US Council for Energy Awareness as vice-president of technical programmes. When the NEI was formed in 1994, he became its vice-president of nuclear economics and fuel supply. Mr Fertel was named senior vice-president and chief nuclear officer of the NEI in 2003. The NEI (www.nei.org; on Twitter @N_E_I) is a policy organisation for the US nuclear technologies industry. It has more than 350 members in 15 countries.Further reading* For more details of the FLEX programme see online: http://safetyfirst.nei.org/industry-actions/flex-the-industry-strategy-to-enhance-safety**For information about the Babcock & Wilcox mPower SMR project see: www.babcock.com/products/modular_nuclear"

            "24 Jan (NucNet): Very small modular reactors (VSMRs) of 10 megawatts or less offer a number of advantages to remote areas, but proliferation resistance will need to be considered at an early stage of the design process if the technology is to become successful, a paper says.",
            "The paper, published in the latest issue of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited’s (AECL) ‘Nuclear Review, says certain features of small modular reactors (SMRs) and particularly VSMRs offer potential advantages to safeguards implementation, while others present challenges that “may not have been widely appreciated”.  Addressing the proliferation resistance advantages of remotely located VSMRs will be essential for development of the technology and safeguard considerations must be incorporated early in the design process, the paper says.The need to incorporate “safeguards by design” raises the possibility of increased monitoring of operational data for verification purposes, which may become a useful aspect of the safeguards approach for such systems. Proliferation resistance is one case where either uncertainty exists due to the early stage of development, or a known gap exists that will require a technical solution.As an example of this uncertainty, VSMRs that incorporate a sealed core will present a high level of resistance to the threat of both technology misuse and material diversion. However, a core that is sealed for many years (possibly decades) presents a potential challenge to regular physical inventory verification, as well as verification of the absence of misuse.The paper says the range of design possibilities for VSMRs is considerable, ranging from evolutionary light water reactor (LWR) technology to more advanced fuel cycles.  Cores may be factory fuelled and shipped to site, or fully assembled on site, and refueling may take place on a regular basis on site, or in a batch replacement process often referred to as the “nuclear battery” concept. Operational modes may also differ widely, the paper notes. These design and operational parameters will all affect the assessment of proliferation resistance, and ultimately the safeguards approach implemented by the International Atomic Energy Agency.Another paper in AECL’s ‘Nuclear Review says proponents of SMRs and VSMRs must show that the technologies can be cost competitive with other energy sources and able to control overall project costs. In addition to potential difficulties in acquiring capital, researchers need to show that SMR technologies can achieve manufacturing scalability – the process of creating a technology that can be manufactured in a manner similar to a highly efficient, or highly scaled, production line. The paper says that the knowledge required to deliver SMRs, a highly complex technology, in a true modular format, is “still in its infancy”. For SMRs to be viewed as a viable cost-effective solution, innovation in this technology will be required. “It is conceivable that this innovation push will generate another nuclear renaissance,” the paper concludes.AECL’s special ‘Nuclear Review’ on small reactors is online:www.aecl.ca/Assets/Nuclear_Review/ANR_1-2_ENG.pdfFollow NucNet on Twitter @nucnetupdates"

            "10 Jan (NucNet): The nuclear energy industry is at “a new crossroads” that could mark the start of a new renaissance or a slow decline as existing nuclear reactors are gradually retired, the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has said.",
            "In the second edition of a publication called ‘Nuclear Energy Today’ the Paris-based agency says there are “fundamental reasons” to support nuclear energy – which provides around 14 percent of the world’s electricity – including its cost competitiveness, security of supply and the pace of technological development.In the end, political decision-makers wishing to use nuclear energy must engage in public dialogue, put in place and enforce regulatory and institutional frameworks, and make a long-term commitment to policies that minimise the investment risk for new build, the report concludes.It says: “The further development of nuclear energy depends on these criteria being met”. If these criteria are met nuclear energy can provide large amounts of affordable electricity while contributing to a reduction of greenhouse gases from the power sector.The report says nuclear technology has “evolved continuously and improved from generation to generation”. It says the next generation of reactors might also include small modular designs suitable for small electric grids, as well as designs able to produce large quantities of electricity with a higher efficiency than today’s reactors.The report says generating nuclear electricity is “generally cost-competitive, even in liberalised markets”, but investors also “face the challenge” of financing the large upfront construction costs while ensuring the long-term stability and political commitment needed to ensure adequate returns on investment over several decades of operation.Nuclear energy as part of a diversified energy mix can “significantly improve” security of energy supply because available uranium resources are sufficient to power fission rectors “throughout the 21st century at least”, the report says.Nuclear energy remains “a controversial technology”, characterised by public concern over safety, the issues of waste management and the risk of proliferation. However, the report says the technical issues of the management of high-level radioactive waste have been solved with deep geological disposal projects under way in several countries.Safety remains a priority for the industry and government, but lessons learned from previous accidents and the sharing of experiences and best practises will lead to higher levels of safety, the report says.It says: “A framework of national laws and international agreements governs virtually all aspects of the use of nuclear energy and efficiently addresses the need for safeguards against the misuse of nuclear technology and materials.”The second edition of ‘Nuclear Energy Today’ is online:www.oecd-nea.org/pub/nuclearenergytoday/6885-nuclear-energy-today.pdf"

            "22 Nov (NucNet): Westinghouse Electric Company will apply for funding from the US Department of Energy (DOE) office of nuclear energy to support the licensing and construction of small modular reactors (SMRs) by 2022, the company has said.  ",
            "In a statement on Tuesday Westinghouse confirmed its interest in applying for the second phase of the DOE funding programme.Westinghouse was one of two companies that missed out in the first round of funding, along with NuScale Power. The DOE said this week that the project supported by that funding will be led by Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) in partnership with the Tennessee Valley Authority, the utility that already operates three commercial nuclear plants – Browns Ferry, Sequoyah and Watts Bar.The second phase of the funding programme was announced this week as part of the Obama administration’s so-called “all-of-the-above” strategy to deploy every available source of energy. The funding will support a new project to design, licence and help commercialise SMRs in the US. Westinghouse said if it receives funding it will work towards getting design certification from the Nuclesar Regulatory Commission for the Westinghouse SMR. It will then seek a combined construction and operating licence for a Westinghouse SMR to be built at Ameren Missouri’s Callaway nuclear site. Westinghouse’s SMR team is led by the NexStart SMR Alliance, which includes a number of US utilities and energy companies.Warner Baxter, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Missouri, said that the next phase of the DOE’s investment funding process is significant from both economic and environmental perspectives.According to Westinghouse, the funds will span a five-year period and, subject to Congressional appropriations, provide a total investment of approximately 900 million US dollars (USD) (about 708 million euro) with at least 50 percent provided by private industry.In his 2011 budget request, president Barack Obama requested USD 39 million for a new programme specifically for SMRs.Although the DOE has supported advanced reactor technologies for years, this is the first time funding has been requested to help get SMR designs licensed for widespread commercial use.Commenting on the B&W SMR project, the DOE said it represents “a significant investment in first-of-a-kind engineering, design certification and licensing for small modular reactors in the United States”.Through a five-year cost-share agreement, the DOE will invest up to half of the total project cost, with the project’s industry partners matching this investment by at least one-to-one. The specific total will be negotiated between the DOE and B&W."

            "Under a memorandum of understanding between FirstEnergy and Generation mPower, the companies said they will perform an independent financial review of mPower economics, evaluate several alternative potential sites for construction of B&W mPower plants, complete a preliminary pre-licensing analysis, and assess the need and timing for prospective deployment of the plants by FirstEnergy. The mPower SMR design has a capacity of 180 megawatts per module and has a fully underground containment structure, the companies said. They did not say when the studies will be completed or how much they, or the reactor project, are expected to cost.In May 2012, North Carolina-based B&W was one of three companies – the others were NuScale Power and Westinghouse – that submitted applications for US Department of Energy funding to support the initial licensing and construction of small modular reactors in the US."

            "3 Jul (NucNet): A university climate scientist says it is “inevitable” that Australia will turn to nuclear energy if it is serious about cutting carbon emissions.",
            "Professor Barry Brook, director of climate science at the University of Adelaide's Environment Institute, said when Australia does decide to build nuclear plants it will choose to focus on next-generation nuclear technology that provides “major safety, waste and cost benefits”.Mr Brook said one particularly attractive sustainable nuclear technology for Australia is the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR). Although the scientific community has known about the benefits of IFR-type designs for many years, there are currently none in commercial operation because the energy utilities are typically “too risk averse to bet on new technologies”, he said.” This is a wasted opportunity for Australia and for the rest of the world.”Mr Brook said IFRs are much more efficient at extracting energy from uranium, can use existing nuclear waste for fuel, produce far smaller volumes of waste that does not require long-term geological isolation, and can be operated at low cost and high reliability. “In order to re-start the nuclear power debate in Australia, it is best to have a solution that overcomes as many public objections as possible: safety, constraints on uranium supplies, long-lived waste, cost, and proliferation. The IFR technology offers a vast improvement in all of these areas.”Mr Brook said that by 2025 contracts for new nuclear plants could be issued and small modular reactors (SMRs) could be built at outback mining sites. By 2030, around 3,000 megawatts of nuclear could be connected to the national grid.Australia has no commercial nuclear plants, but the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation does operate the Opal research reactor near Sydney.Australia also produces uranium for export. According to the Australian Uranium Association, Australia has around 40 percent of the world’s uranium resources that are “recoverable at reasonable cost”.However, the association argues that due to political and other constraints the industry has not expanded to its full potential. Australia currently supplies less than 20 percent of the uranium the world needs."

            "James Conca, senior scientist with the US-based R.J. Lee Group and director of their Centre for Laboratory Sciences in Pasco, Washington, said without a more sustainable and balanced energy mix, the increase in fossil fuels will be “appalling and costly”, and the environmental effects devastating. “To counter this future dystopia, we propose a one third fossil fuel, one third renewable and one third nuclear mix,” Mr Conca said in an article on the Forbes website. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, nuclear's share of global energy production today is about 13 percent.As part of the proposed mix, Mr Conca said there would need to be 1,700 new nuclear reactors to produce electricity totalling 10 trillion kilowatt hours a year from Generation III and Generation IV designs including small modular reactors.All existing coal would need to be replaced with a combination of combined cycle gas and fluidised bed coal reactors which are somewhat cleaner, and three trillion kWhrs/year would need to come from hydroelectric.Over two million wind turbines of three megawatts or more would be needed along with over one trillion kWhrs/year from other alternatives such as wave, tidal and biogas.The cost to implement and operate this mix will be about 65 trillion US dollars (51 trillion euro) over 50 years, about $30 trillion of that in construction alone. A business-as-usual mix of two-thirds fossil fuel would cost about the same to provide 30 trillion kWhrs/yr, with slightly less capital costs but more fuel, and operation and maintenance (O&M) costs.About two percent of global GDP will be needed annually to provide for either of these futures. Financing this level of investment will be the real challenge, Mr Conca said.Mr Conca’s energy blog is online: www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/05/13/what-is-our-energy-future"

            "25 Apr (NucNet): Key policy priorities for the nuclear energy sector are transparent safety protocols and plans, and the need to address increasing public opposition to nuclear power, a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) says. ",
            "The report, ‘Tracking Clean Energy Progress’, says most countries with nuclear power remain committed to its use despite the March 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi accident, but projections suggest that nuclear deployment by 2025 will be below levels required to achieve the 2DS objective.The 2DS objective is an internationally agreed target of limiting the global temperature rise to 2°C above preindustrial levels by 2025.In addition, increasing public opposition could make government ambitions for nuclear power’s contribution to their energy supply harder to achieve.The report, which is presented to ministers and representatives of nations that together account for four-fifths of global energy demand, says stringent safety and risk-management protocols, greater transparency in management and decision making, and major public engagement efforts are necessary to achieve planned nuclear deployment goals.Taking into account possible nuclear phase-outs in Germany, Switzerland and Belgium, potentially shorter reactor lifespans, and longer planning and permitting procedures, nuclear energy deployment is projected to be about 100 gigawatts below the level required to achieve the 2DS objectives by 2025. This represents a drop of about 15 percent against capacity projections before the Fukushima-Daiichi accident and at this rate, it is unlikely that nuclear deployment levels under the 2DS will be achieved, the report says. The power generation sector is expected to contribute more than one-third of potential CO2 emissions reductions worldwide by 2020 under the 2DS, and almost 40 percent of 2050 emissions savings, the report says. Improved power generation efficiency, a switch to lower-carbon fossil fuels, increased use of renewables and nuclear power, and the introduction of CCS (carbon capture and storage) are all needed to achieve this objective.Interest in small modular reactors (SMRs) may revive, given their suitability to small electric grids, the report says. Their modularity and scalability, with more efficient transport and construction, should lead to shorter construction duration, lower cost and overall investment.However, large-scale nuclear plants are still more competitive than SMRs in terms of cost of kilowatt-hours produced.The US is licensing some of the more mature SMR designs, but it is unlikely at this point – given post-Fukushima re-analysis and low gas prices in the US – that many SMR projects will launch before 2020, the report says.The report adds: “China is building the most reactors globally; their reactor construction times have decreased impressively, and are likely to become the fastest in the world.”The report is online: www.iea.org/papers/2012/Tracking_Clean_Energy_Progress.pdf"

According to the report, the electricity from a combined-cycle natural gas plant would range in cost from $60 to $80 per megawatt-hour “in the post-2020 timeframe”. The report, commissioned by the US Department of Energy, estimates that the first SMR would involve electricity costs of approximately $91 to $123 per MWh, and that after “significant learning” from the deployment of the first 18 units of the same design, an SMR could produce electricity at $80 per MWh. With the full effects of learning achieved after the manufacture of 54 SMR modules the price predicted by the study is $60.95 per MWh. The report suggests SMRs could be built in factories where mass production could increase efficiency. The lower-end of the estimate is based on a projected natural gas price of $5.45 per million British thermal units and the upper-end on $7.98/per million Btu, says the report.

Their advantages include lower capital cost with reduced debt profile, shorter construction time, and they can be deployed in markets in the US and abroad that cannot accommodate or afford large reactors.In June 2011, ANS president Joe Colvin testified before the US Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee about legislation related to SMRs.He said the ANS and its membership believe that the development of a new generation of SMRs has the potential to make “a significant contribution to our long-term energy, economic, and national security”. He said the US needs to accelerate the development of SMR-related codes and standards, and update laws and regulations that would speed up transfer of SMR-relevant technology from the national laboratories to US industry and regulators.He added: “Furthermore, I strongly encourage the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to move forward with alacrity in addressing the outstanding generic licensing and regulatory issues, including instrumentation and control, required staffing levels, unique design features, enabling construction activities during operations, and security requirements.”>>Related reports in the NucNet database (available to subscribers)Chu Highlights Importance Of Small Modular Reactor Development (News in Brief No. 56, 24 March 2010)Bill Gates’ TerraPower Continues Talks About ‘Travelling Wave Reactor’ (News in Brief No. 65, 7 April 2010) The NucNet database contains more than 15,000 reports published since 1991.

Some USD 8 billion would support research in clean energy such as wind, solar and advanced batteries.The budget, which will need to be approved by Congress, would also provide USD 853 million to support nuclear energy, including R&D into new nuclear energy technologies such as small modular reactors.The White House is also asking for USD 36 billion in federal loan guarantees to help finance the building of nuclear power plants, as it did last year. The loan programme already has USD 18 billion in authority.To help pay for the clean energy initiatives, the White House is asking Congress to repeal USD 3.6 billion in oil, natural gas and coal subsidies. In addition, the budget proposes cuts in funding for oil and gas research and for hydrogen fuels programmes.The budget proposal says the USD 29.5 billion reflects increases for priority areas such as clean energy, nuclear security, and research and development. “Savings are achieved through cuts to inefficient fossil energy programmes,” it says.The proposal also says the budget continues to support the modernisation of the nation’s electric grid by investing in research, development, and demonstration of smart grid technologies.

            "Rosatom said yesterday on its website that design documents for the fast-neutron SVBR-100 had been drafted ahead of the planned construction of an industrial unit at JSC NIIAR, Russia’s Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Dimitrovgrad.The SVBR-100 is a 100-megawatt small modular reactor with lead-bismuth coolant. When using mixed oxide plutonium-uranium (MOX) fuel, it operates on a closed fuel cycle.Rosatom said that Atomenergoproekt specialists had been undertaking preliminary work on the SVBR model since 2006 for its intended use in nuclear power plants. The current project foresees the construction of a single-block pilot industrial power plant between 2013 and 2017, and comprises three main partners: Atomoenergoproekt OJSC (Moscow); Gidropress OJSC and the Russian state research centre in Obninsk, the Energy Physics Institute.>>Related reports in the NucNet database (available to subscribers)Russia Plans New Research Reactor To Replace BOR-60 (News No. 265, 14 December 2006)"

            "4 Feb (NucNet): Holtec International has successfully completed “proof-of-principle” studies on a 140-megawatt modular reactor whose core is located completely underground.",
            "The HI-SMUR 140 reactor unit, which Holtec said takes about 24 months to build, is operated by gravity induced flow, does not rely on off-site power for shutdown and can be installed as a single unit or a cluster at a site.Florida-based Holtec said the unit’s principal safety credentials derive from locating the core underground in a reactor vessel that has no penetrations to provide a drain-down path for the reactor coolant.Other major features are the unit’s small footprint, minuscule site boundary dose, large inventory of coolant in the reactor vessel and its modularity – the freedom to build the number of units at a site to best suit the owner's projected power needs. Holtec said the underground reactor programme is sufficiently funded to carry out detailed design, analyses, licensing, and other activities to bring the programme to the pre-construction phase. The company said “a number of prominent suppliers” of nuclear technologies and systems from around the globe are supporting the HI-SMUR programme.>>Related reports in the NucNet database (available to subscribers)Chu Highlights Importance Of Small Modular Reactor Development (News in Brief No. 56, 24 March 2010) Consortium To Investigate Small Modular Reactors For Ships (News in Brief No. 206, 16 November 2010)"

            "28 Jan (NucNet): The US will aim to produce 80 percent of its electricity from clean energy sources by 2035, including nuclear energy, said US president Barack Obama during his State of the Union address on 25 January 2011.",
            "Mr Obama said this target would require not only wind and solar, but nuclear, clean coal and natural gas, as he called on the Democrat and Republican parties to “work together” to make this happen.During the address in Washington D.C. Mr Obama called for the US to maintain its leadership in research and technology and translate clean energy breakthroughs into clean energy jobs.“With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with bio-fuels, and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015”, said Mr Obama.US nuclear trade association the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) said the US would “need to develop every possible form of low-carbon technology” to meet the target of developing 1 million electric cars.The NEI’s senior vice-president of governmental affairs Alex Flint said on 26 January that the country’s leading role as a developer of advanced nuclear technologies remained a strategically important policy issue for the US: “for use domestically and for export to a fast-growing global market”, he said.US energy secretary Stephen Chu has previously called for nuclear power to be part of a clean energy mandate, notable during a nuclear energy conference on 7 December 2010. Following the State of the Union address this week, Mr Chu also spoke at the US Department of Energy’s inaugural Energy Matters event on 26 January, confirming his support for the development and export of small modular reactors (SMRs).“SMRs solve a lot of issues in terms of capital investment and electricity infrastructure. We are trying to see if we can accelerate (their) development”, said Mr Chu during the live question and answer session.He added that the export of small modular reactor technology would allow the US to “regain the lead” in nuclear technology. “We were initially the leaders in nuclear reactors, but we are no longer (among) the leaders. They are France, Japan and Korea, and China wants to become the (global) leader.”>>Related reports in the NucNet database (available to subscribers)Chu Calls For Nuclear To Be Part Of 'Clean Energy Mandate' (News in Brief No. 221, 8 December 2010) Utility Agrees Terms For US Conditional Loan Guarantees (News in Brief No. 111, 21 June 2010) US Nuclear Industry Boosted By ‘Transformational’ Policies (News In Brief No. 91, 24 May 2010)"

            "24 Mar (NucNet): The US can give itself a “key competitive edge” by developing the technology to build a new generation of small modular reactors (SMRs), secretary of energy Steven Chu said in an article published yesterday in the Wall Street Journal.",
            "In the article Mr Chu said “America is on the cusp of reviving its nuclear power industry”.He said small modular reactors would be less than one-third the size of current plants and could be made in factories and transported to sites by truck or rail. SMRs would be ready to “plug and play” upon arrival.Mr Chu also said that to truly promote nuclear power and other forms of carbon-free electricity, long-term incentives are needed. He said: “The single most effective step we could take is to put a price on carbon by passing comprehensive energy and climate legislation.”If commercially successful, SMRs would “significantly expand the options for nuclear power and its applications”. Their small size makes them suitable to small electric grids so they are a good option for locations that cannot accommodate large-scale plants, he said.The modular construction process would make them more affordable by reducing capital costs and construction times.Their size would also increase flexibility for utilities since they could add units as demand changes, or use them for on-site replacement of aging fossil fuel plants. Mr Chu noted that in his 2011 budget request, president Barack Obama requested 39 million US dollars (29 million euro) for a new programme specifically for small modular reactors.Although the Department of Energy has supported advanced reactor technologies for years, this is the first time funding has been requested to help get SMR designs licensed for widespread commercial use.The full article is on the DOE’s website (www.energy.gov/news/8782.htm).>>Related reports in the NucNet database (available to subscribers) Obama Announces Loan Guarantees For First US Units In 30 Years (News in Brief No. 34, 16 February 2010)Support For Nuclear ‘Highest Ever’ In US, Says Gallup (News in Brief No. 54, 22 March 2010)"

            "The international consortium behind proposals to build a full-scale demonstration pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR) has reaffirmed support for the project following a feasibility study.",
            "However, a decision to pursue construction of the demonstration plant in South Africa - due to have been taken this month - has been delayed for up to 12 months for a \"number of issues\" to be resolved, said consortium member and US utility Exelon. The other consortium members are South Africa's Eskom, its South African partner the International Development Corporation (IDC) and Britain's BNFL (see Business News No. 102, 5th September 2000).The vice-president of Exelon Generation's international projects, Ward Sproat, told NucNet: \"The feasibility study has been completed and we (Exelon) have reviewed it (see Background No. 8, 28th May).\" He said that as a result of that study \"all four partners feel that we've made sufficient progress to stick with the project\". He confirmed that Exelon still hoped to keep to its original schedule for US licensing of the PBMR, submitting an early site permit application next year with the aim of starting construction in 2005. However, he added: \"There are issues regarding whether or not we can license (a PBMR) in the US. We're talking to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), but it's (a process) that's not going to wend its way through until about the fourth quarter of next year.\"Mr Sproat told the US House of Representatives' energy and commerce committee earlier this year that Exelon's application for a combined construction and operating licence is scheduled for 2003, following the completion of detailed PBMR design in South Africa. If Exelon's own review of the feasibility study was favourable, the company did \"not intend to wait for the completion of the demonstration plant in South Africa to begin the licensing process to build a number of PBMRs\" in the US.He said: \"While technical issues will be complex, there are legal hurdles that appear to be more difficult to resolve. Specifically, there are a number of regulations that were promulgated when it was anticipated that only regulated electric utilities would build nuclear plants. The regulations never foresaw the dawn of a deregulated power generation market and are now obsolete. If Exelon proceeds with building PBMRs, they will be merchant nuclear power plants that will not be in a regulated utility rate structure.\" Shareholders and not ratepayers would bear the financial risk.Mr Sproat warned that the financial burden on small, modular plants of existing \"inappropriate regulations\" could make the economics \"untenable\". In addition, the licensing process to be followed for the PBMR \"has never fully been utilised\" - which would mean a \"steep learning curve\" for the NRC and Exelon leading to high costs and delays. Exelon would also need to work with NRC staff to develop a technical licensing framework because existing regulations were written for light water reactors. \"Regulations will need to be developed for gas reactors, also at additional costs and potential delay.\"Exelon believes the consortium will invest \"upwards of USD 600 million\" to make the reactor commercially viable, with Exelon investing a \"significant additional amount\" to license and build the first PBMRs. However, the utility says it is \"appropriate\" that the US government pays for some technical expertise \"that does not currently exist in the NRC or in national laboratories\"."

Given (the act's) necessary role in the development of the nuclear power industry, it is important to get this done in advance of the August 2002 expiry date. Nuclear power is a key component of the country's diverse electricity-production portfolio and re-authorisation will help pave the way for the construction of much-needed nuclear power plants. \"We have crafted a bill that breaks new ground, while extending the important financial protections for persons who may be injured by a nuclear incident. We have worked closely with the DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and we have incorporated several specific recommendations made by these two agencies. Additionally, we have crafted language that we believe will spur the construction of smaller 'modular' nuclear power reactors. This bill also makes sure that DOE's contractors will continue to engage in their important work at the nation's nuclear laboratories and weapons sites.\"US vice-president Dick Cheney said earlier this year that renewal of the act was needed to \"encourage investment in nuclear\" (see News No. 178, 23rd May)."

        "text": [
            "This year saw the birth of a new global nuclear company. Framatome ANP, which merges the nuclear activities of Framatome and Siemens, now describes itself as the premier global supplier of nuclear services. NucNet spoke to chairman Dominique Vignon about the integration process, the new company's global ambitions, the prospects for the European Pressurised Water Reactor (EPR), and the future of the nuclear industry.",
            "NucNet: The merger represents an ambitious attempt to fuse two very different corporate cultures. How successful has it been to date?Vignon: Framatome and Siemens started to work together long before our merger in at least three areas: development of the EPR, which began in 1989, the replacement of steam generators,  and a number of other joint projects, particularly in eastern Europe and the US. So, contrary to many mergers, we started with considerable knowledge of each other and a track record of success. Obviously, there is more to a merger than just co-operating on a number of projects. However, for a number of reasons – the European Commission being one – our negotiations were also relatively slow, and this gave us additional time to prepare for the integration. More generally, we recognise that the French and the Germans are not the same, do not work the same, do not think the same, have different attitudes. However, we are both engineers, we are rather systematic people, and even those, like myself, who have been co-operating for 10 years with the Germans, went through a new process and training that created mutual understanding and mutual respect. This does not solve all problems, but it helps considerably.NucNet: The new company has a matrix organisational structure, with individual units responsible both to national managers in France, Germany or the US, and to one of four business groups – fuel, services, projects/engineering, and mechanical equipment. How successful is this proving in practice?Vignon: First, the matrix structure is the obvious choice for an organisation like ours – a merger of two companies, active in at least three regions. Customers are local, and want to be supplied locally. On the other hand, we want to exploit synergies and produce the best technology at the lowest cost, which we can only do by streamlining the business groups.  Second, there is the question whether you give more emphasis to the business groups or to the regions.  Even though each region knows its customers very well, we gave emphasis to the four business groups to ensure synergies in areas like research and development, marketing, sales, industrial resources and mix of products and services most attractive to customers.    Third, the most difficult problem in any matrix organisation is how to solve conflicts. Under this structure people have two bosses, and the problem is how to deal with that – particularly so when the organisation is very large. By chance, compared to many companies with such a structure, we are relatively small, and the problems are therefore relatively less important. NucNet: How has the creation of Framatome ANP changed the competitive landscape?Vignon: We have revenues of over 2.5 billion euros and a global workforce of almost 13 000, making us comparable to other nuclear energy companies.  While we are by no means a giant compared to many players in the power generation business, we now have a size that allows us to act globally, and makes it easier for customers to benefit from technology developed for world-wide use. NucNet: The merger follows BNFL's acquisition of Westinghouse and ABB's nuclear businesses, and the GE-Toshiba-Hitachi joint venture for BWR fuel. In terms of market position, how do you now compare?Vignon: We cannot see all the businesses as one. The markets must be split between Europe,  America and Asia, and the technologies between PWR and BWR. In the PWR sector, we are equivalent to Westinghouse – they are stronger in the US, but we think we will be able to improve our position; we are stronger in Europe, and they want to improve their position. In the BWR sector, GE has the leading role by far, and both BNFL and ourselves are challengers – BNFL with the activities inherited from ABB Atom and ourselves with the Siemens technology. NucNet: Framatome ANP has four main business groups – what is their relative importance?Vignon: As a percentage of total revenue, fuel accounts for some 40%, projects and engineering for 30%, nuclear services for 25% and mechanical equipment for 5%.NucNet: How does that revenue break down geographically, and what changes do you foresee in the future – which will be your main growth markets?Vignon: France represented 41% of our total revenues in 2000, the United States and Germany were equal at 18% each, with Asia at 12%, Western Europe and Africa at 8%, and Eastern Europe at 3%.  Revenues for France were  higher than for a 'normal' year, due to the sale of Civaux-2. In fuel and services, we hope to keep our figures for France and Germany about the same, despite tough competition. We expect these shares to shift as we plan to continue increasing market share in the US. As for new plants, we have good prospects in China, and we hope the EPR will be launched in Europe. New US plants might  also be possible.NucNet: To what extent does Framatome ANP's long-term future depend on orders being placed in France – and elsewhere –  for the EPR?Vignon: The EPR, like any new reactor for any vendor, is the key to keeping nuclear technology alive. Fuel and services are more or less about replication, despite some technological improvements. The EPR is the opportunity for new developments. That is one reason why we want a fast decision to actually build it.NucNet: What is the latest position with regard to licensing and development?Vignon: The project has been assessed throughout its development by the French and German safety authorities, and their comments have been included in the design. However, because no decision has been made to start site construction, which would trigger the need to state their final position, they have not yet done so. This is fully understandable – they want this reactor to be state of the art when it is built, and that is why they are waiting until the last minute. If an order were placed now, the formal process would begin, involving licensing of both site and design. In France, final approval would then take about two years.NucNet: EDF indicated recently that it considered it 'indispensable' to have a demonstration EPR operating before 2015. On that timescale, by when would an order have to be placed?Vignon: When EDF refers to 2015, it is the latest date and I guess they would like to have it before. We therefore consider it would be wise to order that reactor in the next couple of years. All the main elements for a decision are now on the table, so – while there can be some political influences – I do not believe a decision can wait very long after they have been taken into consideration. What we currently have in mind is an order in about the year 2003.NucNet: Prime minister Jospin said last year the 'time was not yet right' to decide whether to order a lead unit. Have there been any indications since then of when the time will be 'right'?Vignon: The situation changes constantly, and there have been two positive trends recently. First, the increasing oil prices of the last quarter of 2000, which remain relatively high even now compared to the 1990s. Second, climate change, which I think everyone now accepts is a real issue. These two points mean that the conditions for a decision are improving.NucNet: What about your other advanced reactor projects, in particular the SWR 1000?Vignon: We are lucky to have this design in our portfolio. We lacked a new reactor based on the BWR technology, and we have now inherited it from Siemens. It is also smaller than the EPR with plenty of passive safety features, which can be appealing to some customers.NucNet: How do you see the prospects for the various other advanced reactor designs now on the market, in particular the high-temperature PBMR project? Vignon: We would be very happy if it succeeds, because any sign that new nuclear plants are actively on the agenda of utilities will be positive for nuclear energy. At the same time, we are a bit puzzled by its very low output – 110 MW to 125  MW per unit. If EDF were to replace the Gravelines nuclear plant with this design, they  would need more than 50 reactors at the same site to do so. To meet smaller electricity needs for less-robust electric power grids, we are also co-developing the gas turbine modular helium reactor (GT-MHR) – a new type of nuclear reactor at 280/300 MW per unit stemming from the family of high temperature reactors (HTRs), which are gas-cooled and graphite-moderated.  Still, if it is really possible to design and build a small size reactor at a very acceptable price level, it will beat any other technology. However, this has not yet been proven. On the contrary, we are sure the EPR can beat coal or gas for base-load generation. Is there any intermediate size? The future will tell.NucNet: The future of nuclear energy seems to be closely linked now to the extent of public and political recognition of its environmental benefits. Do you see those prospects as in any way harmed by the Bush administration's effective withdrawal from the Kyoto process?Vignon: Certainly, this will delay the process, but sooner or later it will start again, with the full support of the US administration, which is key to its final success. The way I understand the decision, the Bush administration was not happy with the details of the Kyoto protocol, and there were probably some influential lobbies that wanted to start negotiating on a different basis. However, they will not be able to escape the issue of greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, the administration acknowledged recently that climate change is still an issue. NucNet: Overall, what key factors do you think will determine the future of nuclear energy?Vignon: Competitiveness. That is the key single factor. Even climate change comes a little bit behind. Of course, there are related issues of externalised costs, such as possible carbon taxes and emissions trading permits. However, the fact remains that nuclear energy has to become even more competitive in its own right. I think this is a challenge all vendors face. NucNet: What about the role of public perception?Vignon: I might surprise you, but I think even that is secondary. Public perception could be  reversed if nuclear generation were much more competitive. If, for example, we could generate nuclear electricity at just 10% of the cost of fossil fuel-fired plants, I do not think we would have many more public relations problems."

            "An international team has won a contract to design the plant that will produce fuel for South Africa's pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR) project.",
            "The contract has been awarded to Nukem Nuklear of Germany, UK-based BNFL and Engineering Management Services (EMS) of South Africa, who will work alongside PBMR's own teams to \"develop a safe, cost-effective and modern-day fuel fabrication plant\" which will produce the unique graphite spheres or 'pebbles' used in the PBMR reactors*.PBMR chief executive Dave Nicholls said: \"With this commitment, we have acquired the most experienced fuel plant design team in the world. This should greatly reduce the risk of not having sufficient qualified fuel available when our demonstration plant starts operations in 2005.\"South African utility Eskom announced plans for a new line of small and \"inherently safe\" nuclear power reactors in 1998 (see News No. 15, January 13th, and Business News No. 4, 14th January 1998). The project to develop a commercial scale PBMR is being led by a consortium involving Eskom, its South African partner the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), BNFL and Exelon of the US. The feasibility study into the fuel fabrication facility is expected to be complete later this year.Eskom and the IDC have a joint shareholding of more than 50% in the project. Last year, BNFL took a \"significant\" stake and was followed by Exelon subsidiary Peco Energy (see BN No. 102, 5th September) which took up all remaining shares - with the exception of 10% reserved for a black empowerment company. A joint statement from PBMR, BNFL and Nukem said that under the terms of the contract, Nukem will contribute the technology 'know-how' and process specifications developed and used in its own fuel element fabrication plant, while BNFL would support the technology implementation using best practice design, safety and operational experience. EMS will utilise its skill and experience in transferring the technology into engineering capability.It added: \"The PBMR is a pioneering yet simple nuclear reactor design that is expected to be highly competitive with virtually all other forms of electricity generation. It is predicted that it could be the safest and cleanest power source option for the future.\"*The PBMR reactor is designed in a modular fashion and has a number of unique advantages. Not only is it expected to be relatively inexpensive to build compared to existing reactor designs, but as it is modular, additional units can be added to suit demand. A single PBMR is 53 metres by 27 metres and 47 metres high - half of which would be below ground level. Four modules would fit inside a football stadium. The PBMR concept is a variant of the high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) technology developed in Europe and the USA, starting in the 1960s."

            "Two of the world's top technology chiefs say nuclear power is the 'only solution' to California's energy crisis - even though their views may be seen as 'politically incorrect'.",
            "Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun Microsystems, said: \"This country needs to figure out an energy policy... and I'm going to do the politically incorrect thing and tell you the answer's going to be nuclear power. I have not yet heard anybody utter the phrase 'nuclear power' in California. But in terms of environmental and cost and competitiveness and all the rest of it, I just don't see any other solution. Rolling black-outs are a bad thing.\"His comments echoed those of Craig Barrett, head of Santa Clara-based Intel Corp. He said his firm would consider expanding overseas instead of California because of unreliable power supplies, adding: \"Nuclear power is the only answer, but it's politically incorrect.\"Meanwhile, the US DOE plans to study the feasibility of and issues associated with the deployment of small modular nuclear reactors, for preparation of a report to Congress by May. The DOE has set a 15th March deadline for receiving concept proposals on such reactors up to 50 MW - designed for use in isolated communities that may otherwise rely on relatively expensive and environmentally undesirable fuels for electricity generation. For further information contact DOE's Kenneth Wade at (+1) 301-903-1031."

            "The South African power utility, Eskom, which announced plans last year for a new line of small and \"inherently safe\" nuclear power reactors, expects to decide in the next few months whether or not to proceed with construction. ",
            "Kelvin Kemm, the director of Pretoria-based Stratek Technology Consultants, told the second and final day of the Uranium Institute (UI) annual symposium in London that the pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR) project had now received an initial (non site-specific) regulatory licence, and Eskom was hoping for a final government construction permit before the end of this year. Under Eskom's up-to-date timetable, detailed design work would then be completed by July 2000, and construction would finish in January 2003, with a view to first criticality six months later and commercial start-up by December 2004. Later units of the small, roughly 100 MW, reactors would take just 24 months to build.The PBMR concept is a variant of the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) technology developed in Europe and the US, starting in the 1960s. Eskom says the early projects in this field were technically successful, but failed to be widely commercialised for two reasons: cutbacks in nuclear development spending and a failure at the time to appreciate fully the design's inherent advantages.Dr. Kemm told the conference that the reactor design combined inherent safety, based on passive safety systems which made a core melt-down and subsequent radiation release a physical impossibility, with competitive economics. He said a new independent evaluation showed that, even if Eskom had considerably under-estimated both fuel and non-fuel costs, a new PBMR would still produce electricity more cheaply than a new power station relying on other resources, either in South Africa or in most other countries. He continued: \"The PBMR is ideal for South Africa's future needs, but it is also clearly ideal for other countries, both in the developing world and in the first world.\"In the case of the developing world, it is easier to operate a PBMR than a coal-fired power station with 21st-century specifications. The PBMR does not need a particularly highly-skilled team of operators, and the team is small. A year's supply of fuel can easily be stored on site, which is important in countries where  road and rail supply routes can be highly unreliable. Imagine the constant transportation of coal! PBMRs can also be sited anywhere, being independent of water-cooling. In developing countries, they can be sited such that they have their own localised grid, and do not need to be integrated into a major national grid.\"As far as first world countries are concerned, PMBRs  will also be ideal. They can either be deployed individually in places where small amounts of power are required, or can be clustered on one site in modular fashion. Units can easily be added incrementally as required. First world countries could also use PBMRs to replace existing plants that come to the end of their operating lives. At that point, the option could be exercised either to build a large-scale modular cluster of reactors on one site, or alternatively to distribute the reactors to individual sites and to close down the original large site.â€&#382;Dr. Kemm added that South Africa, in addition to producing and consuming over half of the electricity of the entire continent of Africa, was also perceived as the \"regional economic powerhouseâ€&#382;, with a \"moral obligationâ€&#382; to engage in the \"economic uplifting of the whole regionâ€&#382;. He said realisation of the PBMR project could put it in a very strong position to do just that."

            "The South African power utility, Eskom, has signed an agreement with a joint subsidiary of ABB and Siemens for the transfer of high temperature reactor (HTR) technology.",
            "A statement issued today (Thursday) by ABB Reaktor GmbH in Mannheim, Germany, said the licence and cooperation agreement had been signed by Eskom and the \"HTR-GmbH company for high temperature reactors\", which is jointly owned by ABB and Siemens. It said the agreement gives Eskom the non-exclusive right to use HTR know-how to build HTR reactors, and to manufacture and sell fuel elements. ABB and Siemens will also support Eskom with design and development consulting services. The agreement, described by ABB as a \"milestone in terms of future cooperation\", follows Eskom's 1996 award of a contract to HTR GmbH, to support a techno-economical feasibility study and a safety analysis report.Eskom announced in January 1998 that it was considering developing a new line of small and \"inherently safe\" pebble bed modular reactors (PBMRs), based on the HTR technology initially developed in Europe and the US, starting in the 1960s. It says the early projects in this field were technically successful, but failed to be widely commercialised because of cutbacks in nuclear development spending and a failure to appreciate the design's inherent advantages. In August 1998, Eskom announced plans for a thorough environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the project. It said a decision whether to continue with the next phase - building a pilot plant - could be taken once the design was finalised and licensed. This would in turn depend on completion of the EIA and commercial competitiveness studies.The project suffered an apparent setback last December, when the South African government issued a White Paper on energy policy which predicted that additional generating capacity would not be required before 2007 at the earliest. However, it stated clearly that nuclear had not been excluded as a future supply option; the choice would depend largely on the environmental and economic merits of other energy sources relative to nuclear, on nuclear's political and public acceptability, and on construction lead-times and load characteristics.
