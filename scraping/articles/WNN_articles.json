            "The world’s first modular high temperature gas-cooled reactor nuclear power plant has entered commercial operation, China’s National Energy Administration has announced.",
            "The nuclear island of HTR-PM Demo (Image: Tsinghua University)",
            "It follows a successful 168-hour demonstration run for the High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor - Pebble-bed Module (HTR-PM) in Shidao Bay (also known as Shidaowan), in Shandong Province, which is currently operating at 2×200 MWt power.",
            "The HTR-PM features two small reactors (each of 250 MWt) that drive a single 210 MWe steam turbine. It uses helium as coolant and graphite as the moderator. Each reactor is loaded with more than 400,000 spherical fuel elements (‘pebbles’), each 60 mm in diameter and containing 7 g of fuel enriched to 8.5%. Each pebble has an outer layer of graphite and contains some 12,000 four-layer ceramic-coated fuel particles dispersed in a graphite matrix. The fuel has high inherent safety characteristics, and has been shown to remain intact and to continue to contain radioactivity at temperatures up to 1620°C - far higher than the temperatures that would be encountered even in extreme accident situations, according to the China Nuclear Energy Association.",
            "First concrete for the demonstration project was poured on December 2012, with the operating permit granted in August 2021 and the plant connected to the grid in December 2021. ​The plant has more than 2200 sets of first-of-a-kind equipment, including more than 660 sets of innovative equipment. The supporting fuel element production line has the largest production capacity in the world.",
            "The project is a collaborative effort involving Tsinghua University as a technical leader, responsible for research and development and main components and systems design, with China Huaneng Group as the owner and operator of the plant, and China National Nuclear Coorporation as the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor and fuel manufacturer. Professor Zuoyi Zhang, director of the Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology at Tsinghua University, is the chief scientist and chief engineer for the project.",
            "HTR-PM is a Generation IV nuclear energy technology and a small modular reactor. Two safety demonstration tests were conducted on the reactor modules, each at a power of 200 MWt, on 13 August and 1 September, respectively.",
            "A Tsinghua spokesperson said: \"The normal energy transfer driven by power was stopped during the tests. The measured nuclear power and temperatures within the different reactor structures, described how the reactors were naturally cooled down, without intervention of humans or emergency core cooling systems. The tests confirmed that commercial-scale reactors could be cooled down naturally without emergency core cooling systems for the first time in the world. It is the so-called inherently safe reactor.",
            "\"The major purpose of HTR-PM is to co-generate high temperature steam up to 500℃ and electricity. It is cost effective currently in the Chinese market to supply steam and electricity for the petrochemical industry to substitute the burning of natural gas and coal. This breakthrough technology is recognised to play a positive role in optimising energy structure and achieving China's 'dual carbon' goal. Several commercial projects are under preparation in China.\"",
            "China's National Energy Administration, in announcing the start of commercial operation, said: \"The commissioning of the demonstration project is of great significance and has a positive impact on promoting the safe development of nuclear power in our country and improving our country's nuclear power power scientific and technological innovation capabilities.\"",
            "In an interview last year for World Nuclear Association's",
            "World Nuclear Performance Report 2022",
            ", Lu Hua Quan, chairman of the Nuclear Research Institute, Huaneng Company, explained: \"HTRs have the highest operating temperatures of all existing reactor types, and are also the only reactors that can provide very high-temperature process heat.\" He said there was export potential, especially to countries and regions where freshwater resources were scarce, adding that \"HTRs could in the future provide a source of high-quality high-temperature process heat for various industries, in particular those that are required to limit their carbon emissions\".",
            "The HTR-PM follows on from China's HTR-10, a 10 MWt high-temperature gas-cooled experimental reactor at Tsinghua University's Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology, which started up in 2000 and reached full power in 2003. Beyond the HTR-PM, China proposes a scaled-up version - HTR-PM600 - with one turbine rated at 650 MWe driven by six reactor modules.",

The North Carolina, USA-headquartered company said yesterday it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Synthos SA, a Polish manufacturer of synthetic rubber and one of the country's biggest producers of chemical raw materials.",
            "The BWRX-300 design (Image: GEH)",
            "Jon Ball, executive vice president of nuclear plant projects for GEH, said: \"Through our design-to-cost approach, we are designing the BWRX-300 to be cost-competitive with gas, renewables and other forms of power generation. We applaud Synthos for its interest in small modular reactor technology and advocacy of clean-energy options for Poland.”",
            "Michal Solowow, owner of Synthos, said: \"Utilising small modular reactors to generate clean energy will improve our chances to move away from coal and have a positive impact on our industry and nation.\"",
            "The BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe SMR derived from GEH's 1520 MWe Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) design. According to GEH, the BWRX-300 leverages the design and licensing basis of the ESBWR, which received design certification from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 2014. In May this year, GEH has initiated a vendor design review by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission for its BWRX-300 design.",
            "GEH expects that the BWRX-300 will require up to 60% less capital cost per megawatt when compared to other water-cooled SMR designs or existing large nuclear reactor designs. It is the tenth evolution of GE's first boiling water reactor design, since it began commercialising nuclear reactors in 1955.",
            "Poland has plans to build its first large-scale nuclear power plant. According to a draft energy policy document released for public consultation last November by Poland’s Ministry of Energy, this will be in operation by 2033. The document envisages 6-9 GWe of nuclear capacity in operation by 2043, accounting for about 10% of Poland's electricity generation. The selection of location for the first plant would be made in 2020, while the selection of the technology and general contractor would take place the following year. The first plant - with a capacity of 1.0 to 1.5 GWe - would be completed by 2033. Up to six reactors, with a combined capacity of 6-9 GWe, would be put into operation by 2043.",

            "with central vertical hot leg,",
            "core internals, reactor core",
            "The 200 MWe design is an integrated pressurized water reactor (PWR) in which all primary components are located inside the reactor pressure vessel. It is designed to be completely fabricated in the factory and is scaled to be shippable by rail. The Westinghouse SMR's passive safety systems and components draw on those developed in the design of the AP1000, the company's full-scale PWR currently under construction at Haiyang and Sanmen in China and earmarked for new build projects at Vogtle and VC Summer in the USA.",
            "Both the core and reactor vessel internals of the SMR are derived from the AP1000. The core, at the foot of the module, is composed of partial-height derivatives of the 17x17 fuel assembly used in the AP1000. The reactor vessel internals are modified for the smaller core and to provide support for the internal control drive rod mechanisms. Horizontally-mounted axial-flow canned motor pumps provide the driving head for the reactor coolant system, and a compact steam generator and pressurizer integrated into the reactor vessel head completes the design.",
            "Westinghouse chief technology officer Kate Jackson said the unit would be another option for providing a safe, affordable and secure source of clean-air energy to the world's rapidly changing and diverse markets: \"The Westinghouse SMR enables us to bring together all that we know about operating nuclear plants, designing and licensing plants, and passive safety into a small design that will provide additional power options for our customers.\"",
            "Generically, small modular reactors are seen as offering a number of advantages over typical nuclear plants in various circumstances, such as where grid systems cannot cope with the load from a 1000+ MWe nuclear power plant, or in remote locations. Small reactors are expected to offer greater simplicity of design, economy of mass production, and reduced siting costs as well as incorporating a high level of passive or inherent safety in the event of malfunction. A number of small reactor designs from 25 MWe up to around 300 MWe are in various stages of development around the world.",
            "In a press release which described the Westinghouse SMR as \"another milestone in energy history\", Westinghouse also said it was actively working to prepare for the upcoming US Department of Energy small reactors program, and intended to be the \"leading industry collaborator\" in the initiative. In May 2010, US energy secretary Steven Chu announced $20 million of funding for research and development in Generation IV reactors including small reactors, and the US budget request submitted earlier this week by President Barack Obama included a $97 million request to support research into small modular reactors."

            "AP300 small modular reactor",
            "Westinghouse has launched what it calls a \"game-changer\" AP300 small modular reactor, a scaled-down version of its AP1000 reactor, with a goal for the first one to deliver power to the grid within a decade.",
            "How the AP300 might look (Image: Westinghouse)",
            "The AP300 SMR, based on the licensed and operating AP1000 pressurised light water technology, is described as an \"ultra-compact, modular constructed unit that leverages the innovation and operational knowledge of the global AP1000 fleet\" and will use identical AP1000 technology including \"major equipment, structural components, passive safety, proven fuel and I&C systems\".",
            "Westinghouse says it is the first SMR \"based on an Nth-of-a-kind operating plant\" and it hopes to benefit from the design utilising its Gen III+ technology which already has regulatory approval in the USA, UK and China as well as being in compliance with European Utility Requirements.",
            "President and CEO of Westinghouse Patrick Fragman said: \"The launch of the AP300 SMR rounds out the Westinghouse portfolio of reactor technology, allowing us to deliver on the full needs of our customers globally, with a clear line of sight on schedule of delivery, and economics.\"",
            "\"It is using the DNA of the AP1000 in terms of technology\", he said, with its passive safety systems \"which has unique advantages in terms of robustness of the safety case, simplicity of the design, with huge implications in terms of costs and time to construct and obviously an ease of deployment because, with the AP1000 being already deployed, the AP300 SMR will leverage the existing supply chain, the existing design, the existing licensing pedigree\".",
            "\"It is no more and no less than an AP1000 with one loop instead of two loops - which means it's effectively reusing a majority of components, systems, equipment. The fuel is identical, the constructability lessons are identical,\" he said.",
            "Westinghouse was bringing \"certainty\" to the SMR market in terms of a proven design, existing supply chains and economics, he said. Market soundings over recent months and discussions with potential customers had led the company to believe this was an \"inflection point\" for the market.",
            "In a press conference following the announcement, Westinghouse also said the footprint of the AP300 would be about 25% of the area of a football (soccer) pitch, with a target cost per unit of USD1 billion.",
            "Fragman said that the timeline was aiming to get licensing approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission by 2027 \"given the existing maturity of the design and reuse of the building blocks of licensing\", followed by three years to get site-specific permissions and a further three years for construction \"which means that in 10 years from now the first AP300 SMR will effectively deliver its first power to the grid\".",
            "The company believes that the customer base for the SMR will be broader than existing utility customers, and will include uses such as hydrogen production, district heating, water desalination and providing power for data centres.",
            "David Durham, President Energy Systems at Westinghouse, said that the initial licensing focus was on design certification from the NRC: \"That's typically the kind of stamp of approval around the world - we will be pursuing, though, licensing in other countries over the coming next couple of years\".",
            "Westinghouse has named Rita Baranwal, currently Chief Technology Officer, to lead the team developing the AP300 SMR. Baranwal is a former Assistant Secretary of Nuclear Energy at the US Department of Energy, and a previous director of the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear initiative at Idaho National Lab.",
            "The AP300 SMR will sit between the AP1000 and the eVinci microreactor, a range of products which, the company said, together with other developments, meant Westinghouse was providing \"the technology to create a sustainable future and enhance energy security around the globe and eventually in outer space\".",
            "There are upwards of 50 different SMRs at various stages of development, with predictions of huge demand to come around the world,",
            "with a number of different firms discussing or pencilling orders for them",
            "in countries ranging from Poland to the Philippines.",

            "Westinghouse wants to work with the UK on the deployment of small modular reactor (SMR) technology. Westinghouse, part of the Toshiba group, said yesterday it had presented a \"proposal to partner\" in phase two of a study being carried out by the UK government into the nation's potential use of SMRs.",
            "Phase one - an SMR feasibility study commissioned by the government and carried out by the UK's National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) - was published in December last year. There are SMR concepts for a range of applications including electricity production, district heating, desalination and plutonium management.",
            "A cut-away of Westinghouse's SMR",
            "Westinghouse said that its unsolicited proposal outlines a \"shared design and development model\" under which the company would contribute its SMR conceptual design and then partner with UK government and industry to complete, license and deploy it. It added that the collaboration would create \"a new option for safe, clean-air energy that leverages the innovative technology\" of Westinghouse's AP1000 nuclear power plant.",
            "\"We are proposing a strategy that would put the UK at the forefront of SMR development, advancing its standing in nuclear energy innovation and creating significant economic opportunities through leadership in the global market,\" said Jeff Benjamin, senior vice president, Westinghouse New Plants and Major Projects. \"Our proposal is designed to fully engage UK industry and spur new manufacturing activity that would create numerous good jobs in the UK.\"",
            "Westinghouse's SMR design is a 225 MWe integral pressurized water reactor with all primary components located inside the reactor vessel.",
            "The partnership would be structured as a UK-based enterprise jointly owned by Westinghouse, the UK government and UK industry, Westinghouse said, adding that it is in talks with \"a number of UK flagship companies\" that support for the concept.",
            "Westinghouse announced on 17 March that the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) it had approved Westinghouse's testing approach for its SMR design. The company said that the approval is a significant step toward design certification and will reduce the time ultimately needed to license its SMR.",
            "The Westinghouse-designed Sizewell B plant, in Suffolk, England was built in 1988 and is currently the only pressurized water reactor and last nuclear reactor built to date in the UK. In addition, three Westinghouse AP1000 units are planned for the Moorside site in West Cumbria. When fully operational, the units will deliver about seven percent of the UK's future electricity needs.",
            "The AP1000 plant design received a design certification amendment from the NRC in 2011. Eight AP1000 units are currently under construction at four sites in the USA and China.",
            "A UK parliamentary committee said after publication of the SMR feasibility study in December, that the technology could potentially have a key role to play in delivering low carbon energy at a lower upfront capital cost than large conventional nuclear reactors. The commercial viability of SMRs however remains unclear, it added. The study suggested that, in the short-term, deployment of SMRs is likely to be achieved through sharing the costs between the public and private sector. However, it says the government should help establish the right conditions for investment in SMRs, such as \"through supporting the regulator to bring forward approvals in the UK, and by setting out a clear view on siting options\".",
            "The government later said that the second phase of work is intended to provide the technical, financial and economic evidence base required to support a policy decision on SMRs. If a future decision was to proceed with UK development and deployment of SMRs, then further work on the policy and commercial approach to delivering SMRs will need to be undertaken, which could lead to a technology selection process for Generic Design Assessment (GDA), the government said.",
            "On 5 October NuScale said it aims to deploy its SMR technology in the UK with the first of its 50 MWe units in operation by the mid-2020s. The company is looking for partners to make this happen. US-based NuScale is developing its technology with a cost-sharing award from the US Department of Energy (DOE) worth $217 million over five years. Next year the company wants to apply for design certification and it hopes to have its first unit in operation in late 2023, generating power in Idaho for prospective customer the Utah Association of Municipal Power Systems. NuScale plans a construction and operating licence (COL) application late in 2017 or early 2018. The company also expects to apply for a GDA in the UK in a similar timeframe.",
            "The NUScale Power Module is a 160 MWt, 50 MWe integral PWR with natural circulation.",
            "The Prism and Enhanced Candu 6 (EC6) reactors are seen as \"credible options\" for managing the UK's plutonium stockpile, according to the UK's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, but the government's preferred option for this remains reuse as mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel. In early 2012, the NDA invited expressions of interest on potential alternative credible full lifecycle management options for managing the UK's plutonium stockpiles. The use of plutonium in MOX fuel had earlier been selected as the preferred route by the government. Four responses were received and the NDA shortlisted two of them - GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy's Prism reactor and Candu Energy's EC6 reactor - for further consideration.",
            "NNL has said that SMRs are proposed to have more flexible fuel cycle options, whether that is an \"open\" fuel cycle (direct disposal) or a \"closed\" fuel cycle (reprocessing and recycling). For example, a fast reactor SMR fleet could be envisaged as a dedicated reactor concept to manage plutonium stocks and minor actinide incineration. Light water reactor SMRs could equally be used for plutonium management, as proposed for the IRIS (International Reactor Innovative and Secure) design and with the potential of these designs to have a reduced or even avoid the need for an Emergency Planning Zone.",
            "SMRs are defined as nuclear reactors generally 300 MWe equivalent or less, designed with modular technology using module factory fabrication, pursuing economies of series production and short construction times. This definition, from the World Nuclear Association, is closely based on those from the IAEA and the US Nuclear Energy Institute."

Hyperion has designed a 25 MWe fast reactor, while Holtec and NuScale have designed small pressurized water reactors with capacities of 140 MWe and 45 MWe, respectively.",
            "According to the DoE, the agreements will \"help leverage Savannah River's land assets, energy facilities and nuclear expertise to support potential private sector development, testing and licensing of prototype SMR technologies.\" In addition, they would help private companies to \"obtain information on potential SMR reactor siting at Savannah River and provide a framework for developing land use and site services agreements to further these efforts.\"",
            "The DoE said, \"By strengthening information sharing and access to site facilities and technical expertise, these MoAs will help break down engineering and testing barriers to advanced nuclear reactor research and development while providing these nuclear companies with the resources to support effective deployment plans.\"",
            "Savannah River manager Dave Moody said, \"We have a unique combination of nuclear knowledge and laboratory expertise, infrastructure, location and much more to make the site a natural fit for advancing the small modular reactor technology.\"",
            "However, the DoE stressed that the new agreements \"do not constitute a federal funding commitment.\" It said that it envisages private sector funding to be used to develop these technologies and support deployment plans. The DoE added that the agreements are unrelated to its funding opportunity announcement for SMR cost-share projects announced in January.",
            "Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, which manages SRS on behalf of the DoE, has proposed a demonstration complex with prototype or demonstration models. Hyperion has signed an agreement to build the first and SRNS has approached several other small-reactor developers. The DoE has the authority to build and operate such small reactors if they are not supplying electricity to the grid.",

However, as Savannah River is federally-owned site, it would be possible to construct a prototype unit at the site without having fully completed the NRC's usual licensing procedures. Nevertheless, the regulator would still be closely involved.",

            "GE with the US national laboratories had been developing Prism - a modular liquid sodium-cooled inherently-safe reactor – under the Advanced Liquid Metal Reactor/Integral Fast Reactor (ALMR/IFR) program funded by the DoE. That program was cancelled in 1994. However, the 1994 pre-application safety evaluation report for the original Prism design concluded that \"no obvious impediments to licensing the Prism design had been identified.\"",
            "GEH is now touting the Prism design as its Generation IV solution to closing the fuel cycle in the USA. Each Prism power block consists of two modules. The pool-type modules, below ground level, contain the complete primary system with sodium coolant.",
            "A key attribute of Prism technology is that it generates additional electricity from recycling used nuclear fuel. The reactor's fuel - metal plutonium and depleted uranium - is obtained from the used fuel from light water reactors. Fuel stays in the Prism reactor for about six years, with one-third removed every two years. Used Prism fuel is recycled after removal of fission products.",
            "SRNS has been actively working with industry and stakeholder groups on the development of energy security initiatives for DoE to consider at the Savannah River Site (SRS). \"We think Prism can be ideally suited to support one of the SRNS initiatives, as Prism technology has the potential to address many of the nuclear fuel challenges we face today,\" said Caroline Reda, president and CEO of GEH.",
            "Garry Flowers, president and CEO of SRNS, commented: \"We believe that SRS is an ideal place to demonstrate the Prism reactor design as it, and other next generation, small modular reactors, are being considered for the future. Successful deployment of this reactor technology could help the United States be a leader in advanced, small modular reactor technologies and assist in achieving an important goal of the Obama administration for US energy independence.\"",
            "In September, SRNS signed a similar MoU with Hyperion which could lead to the construction of a prototype of Hyperion’s small fast reactor design. The agreement \"envisions collaboration with the Department of Energy (DoE) on an array of technical and policy issues.\"",
            "Also installed underground, the small Hyperion unit would have a thermal capacity of 75 MW. From this it should be possible to generate some 25 MWe, which Hyperion said is \"enough to power a US military base, university or government complex.\"",
            "The Hyperion fast reactor design uses lead bismuth coolant and uranium nitride fuel enriched to almost 20% uranium-235. It would need refuelling only every ten years and this would be done by removing the entire power module, which includes the reactor core and primary coolant loop. At Savannah River the plan is to remove these in standard nuclear transport containers to a specialist facility so that no high-level radioactive materials are stored on site."

However, yesterday's announcements did not confirm the exact level of funding to come from the DoE - which is to be agreed based on negotiation with B&W - nor whether another winner would be announced. The program was modelled after the Nuclear Power 2010 program which accelerated the design and licensing of Westinghouse's AP1000 reactor.",
            "At less than 300 MWe in capacity, SMRs are much smaller than typical nuclear reactors and are considered an ideal choice for areas which can't support a larger reactor. The DoE notes that an SMR's compact scalable design offers a host of potential safety, construction and economic benefits.",

Our company, our partners, and our industry are working hard to turn the vision of a more practical, flexible and affordable clean energy solution into reality. With the DoE's support, we can deliver this important innovation to the energy industry and our nation more quickly and with less risk.\"",

            "The UK has the capabilities to produce the reactor pressure vessel for Westinghouse's small modular reactor (SMR) design, according to an independent assessment by the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (NAMRC).",
            "Westinghouse announced in early March that a manufacturing study to investigate the fabrication of reactor pressure vessels (RPVs) for its SMR in the UK would be carried out through a collaboration with the NAMRC. The RPV is \"one of the largest and most demanding parts of any reactor\", they said.",
            "A cutaway of the SMR vessel",
            "On 15 April, Westinghouse and NAMRC announced that the study had concluded that Westinghouse's use of UK advanced manufacturing techniques \"offers a potential 50% reduction in delivery lead times and offers substantial cost savings to SMR manufacturing\".",
            "Westinghouse senior vice president for new plants and major projects Jeff Benjamin said, \"The ability to source locally the steel, forge, machine and then assemble all of the Westinghouse Small Modular Reactor RPV is a significant finding and builds on our unique offering to the UK government.\" He added, \"We are confident that our innovative approach and ability to localize our supply chain and manufacturing in the UK, further demonstrates our commitment to developing SMR technology in the UK.\"",
            "Westinghouse noted, \"The UK's strong nuclear supply chain, as well as Westinghouse's commitment to SMR technology, would promote economic growth and job creation in the UK's nuclear industry.\"",
            "The NAMRC is a collaboration of academic and industrial partners from across the civil nuclear manufacturing supply chain, and was established in 2012 with the mission of helping UK manufacturers win work at home and worldwide.",
            "NAMRC CEO Mike Tynan said, \"The results of this manufacturing study demonstrate the important role that Nuclear AMRC can play in identifying efficiencies within the advanced manufacturing process to significantly reduce capital costs and drive project savings, whilst also highlighting key opportunities for the UK supply chain, which can only benefit the UK economy.\"",
            "Westinghouse said the study is \"an important part\" of its SMR offer to the UK government. Last October, Westinghouse presented a \"proposal to partner\" in phase two of a study being carried out by the UK government into the nation's potential use of SMRs. Phase one - an SMR feasibility study commissioned by the government and carried out by the UK's National Nuclear Laboratory - was published in December 2014.",
            "In January, Westinghouse said its Springfields nuclear fuel fabrication facility in the UK had \"reached the requirements necessary\" for manufacturing fuel assemblies for its SMR. The company said the Springfields plant achieved this \"crucial milestone\" following a \"readiness assessment\" based upon fabrication data for two proprietary SMR fuel assemblies produced at its fuel fabrication plant in Columbia, South Carolina, USA.",
            "The Westinghouse SMR is a 225 MWe integral pressurized water reactor design with all primary components located inside the reactor vessel and utilizes the passive safety functionality developed for the company's AP1000 reactor, currently being built at sites in China and the USA. The SMR design's reliance on existing technology and the proven licensing basis should likely reduce development time and licensing risk for the reactor."

            "Holtec's 160 MWe small modular reactor uses low-enriched uranium fuel. The factory-built reactor's core and all nuclear steam supply system components would be located underground, and the design incorporates a wealth of features including a passive cooling system that would be able to operate indefinitely after shutdown. No active components, such as pumps, are needed to run the reactor, which does not need any on-site or off-site power to shut down and to dissipate decay heat. The SMR-160 is planned for operation by 2026.",
            "SMR LLC submitted a proposal to the US Department of Energy on 31 January with support from GEH and GNF, among others, in response to a funding opportunity announcement. This is for a test programme to investigate and validate the performance of the passive safety features of SMRs. Under the proposal, GEH and GNF will support phenomena assessments, scaling analyses, safety analysis system code assessment, and benchmarking and identification of recommended experimental tests.",
            "GEH and Holtec said the project \"would yield a uniquely configurable set of testing platforms\" to demonstrate passive safety system performance, accelerate the SMR-160 and other SMR designs to market and help licence them with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and international regulators.",
            "In July last year, Holtec signed a teaming agreement with Canada's SNC-Lavalin to collaborate in the development of the SMR-160. Under the agreement, SNC-Lavalin - the parent company of Candu Energy - will provide Holtec with a range of nuclear engineering services, including supporting the licensing of the SMR-160 reactor.",
            "Holtec has previously secured engineering, design and qualification support for its work on the SMR-160 from the Shaw Group and URS Corporation, and has a strategic alliance with utility PSEG Power, operator of three nuclear units at Salem and Hope Creek in New Jersey. In August 2015, Mitsubishi Electric Power Products Inc signed a long-term partnership agreement with Holtec to develop the instrumentation and control systems for the SMR-160.",
            "The project was selected by the US Department of Energy in 2012 as one of three SMR projects to be demonstrated potentially at its Savannah River site in South Carolina. The NRC is carrying out pre-application activities on the reactor design."

They are expected to offer greater simplicity of design, economy of mass production, and reduced siting costs, with large components being fabricated remotely and transported to the operating site.",
            "Several different SMR designs are in development around the world. The Westinghouse SMR is a 225 MWe integrated PWR in which all primary components are located inside the reactor pressure vessel. It is designed to be completely fabricated in the factory and is scaled to be shippable by rail, with passive safety systems and components drawing on the full-sized AP1000 reactor design.",
            "Westinghouse has been working towards developing its SMR in the USA, applying for funding through federal development schemes as well as setting up collaborations with US utilities to support licensing and deployment activities. The company said that it expects the new partnership with SNPTC to accelerate the deployment of its SMR technology in the USA, but emphasised that SMR plants deployed in the USA would be domestically sourced and manufactured.",
            "Four AP1000 reactors under construction at Haiyang and Sanmen in China are due to start up in 2014-2015 and form the first of a planned fleet of AP1000s in the country. Technology transfer to general contractor SNPTC has formed a major part of the project. The announcement of the latest Westinghouse-SNPTC collaboration comes days after the companies launched a joint venture to develop the global supply chain for the AP1000."

            "Mitsubishi Electric Power Products Inc (MEPPI) is to develop the instrumentation and control systems for Holtec International's SMR-160 reactor under a long-term partnership agreement between the two companies.",
            "Holtec's vision for SMR-160 (Image: Holtec)",
            "MEPPI, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation's US subsidiary, will perform the design engineering work for the reactor's digital instrumentation and control systems and for the human-system interface equipment needed to operate the power plant. It will also lead the development of the relevant licensing documents to enable the reactor to be constructed and certified in host countries.",
            "Under the agreement, MEPPI also becomes the global provider-of-choice for electrical components, software and hardware used in the digital instrumentation and control systems and for the human-system interface of the SMR-160.",
            "MEPPI president Brian Heery said the company was \"delighted\" to be partnered with Holtec in the project. \"We are extremely impressed with the SMR-160 design and are committed to providing it an equally high quality control system,\" he said.",
            "Holtec vice president of reactor technologies Tom Marcille pointed to MEPPI's established position as a technology leader in nuclear plant instrumentation and control. \"MEPPI will bring certain state-of-the-art digital control technologies to the SMR-160, as implemented in numerous plants worldwide, with proven licensing and performance certainty,\" he said.",
            "Holtec's 160 MWe small modular reactor uses low-enriched uranium fuel. The factory-built reactor's core and all nuclear steam supply system components would be located underground, and the design incorporates a wealth of features including a passive cooling system that would be able to operate indefinitely after shutdown. No active components, such as pumps, are needed to run the reactor, which does not need any on-site or off-site power to shut down and to dissipate decay heat. Holtec describes the system as 'walk-away safe', meaning that, in the event of a severe natural disaster or act of sabotage, the plant's innate defences would continue to keep the reactor and its spent fuel pool safe even in the absence of an operator.",
            "Holtec has previously secured engineering, design and qualification support for its work on the SMR-160 from the Shaw Group and URS Corporation, and has a strategic alliance with utility PSEG Power, operator of three nuclear units at Salem and Hope Creek in southern New Jersey. The project was selected by the US Department of Energy in 2012 as one of three small modular reactor projects to potentially be demonstrated at its Savannah River site in South Carolina. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission is carrying out pre-application activities on the reactor design in anticipation of a design certification application expected in the final quarter of 2016."

NuScale units by contrast product only 50 MWe each, which are factory-made and can be combined in groups of up to 12. \"Our technology is smaller, scalable, easier to finance, quicker to build and easier to mix with renewables,\" said Hopkins.",
            "\"SMRs will happen in the UK and much sooner than people think,\" said Hopkins. Before any UK deployment NuScale would have to go through the Office for Nuclear Regulation's process for Generic Design Assessment, which requires an identified site and support from a credible reactor purchaser, and takes three to four years. Any construction project would also require planning permission determined at the national strategic level and, of course, local support.",
            "Launching a prospectus and hoping to attract more commercial interest in its offering, NuScale listed its current UK partners. NuScale is majority-owned by Fluor, which has a significant base at Farnborough; it has worked on fuel design development with the UK's National Nuclear Laboratory; it collaborated with Rolls-Royce on skills issues during its bid for US DOE funding; it sponsors an internship program with the University of Sheffield and Oregon State University; it is discussing technology development with the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre; and this year NuScale opened an office in London."

            "Canada has launched a process to prepare a roadmap to explore the potential of on- and off-grid applications for small modular reactor (SMR) technology. The roadmap will help position Canada to become a global leader in the emerging SMR market, according to Natural Resources Canada (NRCan).",
            "The roadmapping process, which is part of NRCan's Energy Innovation Program, was announced on 22 February by Parliamentary Secretary Kim Rudd on behalf of Minister of Natural Resources Jim Carr. Driven by interested provincial and territorial governments and energy utilities, the exercise will be delivered by the Canadian Nuclear Association. It will engage stakeholders to better understand their views on priorities and challenges related to the possible development and deployment of SMRs in Canada.",
            "Participation in the roadmap will eventually expand to include all \"essential enabling partners\" including manufacturers, researchers, waste management organisations and the national nuclear regulator, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC).",
            "According to NRCan, the roadmap aims to foster innovation and establish a long-term vision for the industry, as well as to assess the characteristics of different SMR technologies and their alignment with Canadian requirements and priorities.",
            "\"Through the Generation Energy dialogue, we heard that a pan-Canadian approach is needed on nuclear energy to help guide important decisions by private and public leaders,\" Rudd said, referring to 2017's national dialogue on Canada's energy future, to which over 380,000 Canadians contributed. \"We are bringing this approach to the SMR roadmap, working with key stakeholders to better understand their views on how we can develop and deploy this emerging technology,\" she said.",
            "National nuclear science and technology organisation Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) last year set a goal of siting a new SMR on its Chalk River site by 2026, receiving 19 expressions of interest in siting a prototype or demonstration SMR at a CNL site. Canadian company Terrestrial Energy in June last year began a feasibility study for the siting of the first commercial Integrated Molten Salt Reactor at Chalk River.",
            "The CNSC is currently involved in pre-licensing vendor design reviews - an optional service to assess of a nuclear power plant design based on a vendor's reactor technology - for ten small reactors with capacities in the range of 3-300 MWe. It received its most recent VDR applications - for NuScale Power's self-contained 50 MWe integral pressurised water reactor and Westinghouse's eVinci micro reactor - earlier this month.",

It also lowers the company's levelized cost of electricity by up to 18%, making it \"even more competitive\" with other electricity generation sources, it said. The new gross-output of a NuScale power plant to 720 MWe \"not only offers an impressive amount of carbon-free generation, it also measures up to significant savings when compared to today's competing gigawatt-size plants\", it added.",

            "Doug Hunter, CEO of UAMPS, said the substantial reduction in cost per kilowatt is not only \"incredibly good news\" for the country's first SMR plant, but also because it will increase the value of its plant over time.",
            "The regulatory process of increasing the level of maximum reactor power at which a nuclear plant can operate is referred to as a power uprate. The 20% power increase will be reviewed separately and not impact the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) current design review of NuScale's SMR or the scheduled September 2020 approval date of its Design Certification Application (DCA).",
            "NuScale said that since it has made this determination before any plant construction or equipment manufacture, UAMPS will \"reap the benefit\" of this optimisation without licensing or construction delays.",
            "In January, NuScale announced the NRC agreed NuScale's SMR design approach requires no safety-related power to safely shut down. No operating nuclear plant in the USA can make that claim, the company said. The NRC also recently completed its Phase 1 review of NuScale's DCA.",

The reactor will operate as a national user facility. DOE has not yet decided whether to establish VTR driver fuel production capabilities at INL, Savannah River, or a combination of those two sites, the record notes.",
            "The VTR programme was launched by the DOE in 2018, bringing together a team of experts from national laboratories, universities and industry partners.

Equivalent testing capacity is currently only available in Russia, DOE said.",

            "Lloyd's Register of the UK announced today it has signed a framework agreement with the Nuclear Power Institute of China (NPIC) to support the design and development of a floating nuclear power plant utilizing a small modular reactor (SMR).",
            "Under the framework agreement, Lloyd's Register and NPIC - a subsidiary to China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) - will cooperate on the development of the \"first-of-a-kind floating nuclear vessel\" which will be used in Chinese waters to supply electrical power to offshore installations.",
            "Lloyd's Register said the first contract under the framework agreement is to develop new safety regulations, safety guidelines, and nuclear code and standards for the floating vessel, that are consistent with Offshore and International Marine Regulations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear safety standards.",
            "Mark Bassett, director of nuclear at Lloyd's Register Energy, said: \"NPIC recognizes Lloyd's Register's unique combination of experience in nuclear, offshore and marine safety and regulation. Because we apply our expert knowledge to help clients design, construction and operate capital intensive assets to their highest levels of safety and performance, NPIC have asked us to help them safely achieve this technically challenging offshore nuclear program.\"",
            "Lloyd's Register Energy's vice-president of strategic development for Greater China, Melvin Zhang, said, \"This project is expected to set the pace for how nuclear power can be used and applied to support sustainable power generation in both energy and marine sectors.\"",
            "A Lloyd's Register spokesman confirmed to",
            "that the floating nuclear power plant would be based on a marine version of CNNC's ACP100 SMR design, known as the ACP100S. This 100 MWe design with passive safety features has been under development since 2010 and its preliminary design was completed in 2014.",
            "The ACP100 is an integrated pressurized water reactor in which the major components of its primary coolant circuit are installed within the reactor pressure vessel. It is a multi-purpose reactor designed for electricity production, heating, steam production or seawater desalination.",
            "CNNC New Energy Corporation, a joint venture of CNNC (51%) and China Guodian Corp, is planning to build two ACP100 units in Putian county, Zhangzhou city, at the south of Fujian province, near Xiamen, as a demonstration plant.",
            "In April, CNNC signed an agreement with the IAEA for a Generic Reactor Safety Review (GRSR) of the ACP100. The GRSR process reviews the completely- or partially-developed safety cases of new reactor designs that are not yet at the licensing stage. This involves an international team of experts evaluating design safety case claims against selected and applicable IAEA safety standards. The review was scheduled to begin in July and expected to take seven months to complete.",
            "In a statement about today's agreement with Lloyd's Register, NPIC said: \"We believe there is substantial opportunity to further efforts in developing safe, clean, sustainable power generation for the future, and our latest initiative to develop energy supplies to offshore installations through nuclear power is just one example of how we are seeking to innovate and apply new ways of using nuclear technology for robust power supply.\"",
            "The only floating nuclear power plant today is the Akademik Lomonosov, under construction in Russia, where two 35 MWe reactors similar to those used to propel ships are being mounted on a barge to be moored at a harbour. The Baltiysky Zavod in St Petersburg is on schedule to deliver the first floating nuclear power plant to its customer, Russian nuclear power plant operator Rosenergoatom, in September 2016. It could start operating in Chukotka as early as in 2017.",
            "Floating plants offer various advantages: construction in a factory or shipyard should bring efficiencies; siting is simplified; environmental impact is extremely low; and decommissioning can take place at a specialised facility. However, the offshore environment brings important considerations, such as access for personnel and equipment and the need for strong assurance that uncontrolled contamination of the sea would be impossible."

            "NuScale Power's small modular reactor (SMR) has the capability of using mixed uranium-plutonium oxide (MOX) fuel in addition to conventional light water reactor fuel, a study by the UK's National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) has confirmed.",
            "NuScale Power said in a statement yesterday that the study commissioned from the NNL supports the suitability of the company's NuScale Power Module - a 160 MWt, 50 MWe integral pressurized water reactor with natural circulation - for the effective disposition of plutonium.",
            "The study, it said, evaluated scenarios with partial and full-core loading of MOX fuel and confirmed that MOX could be used in the NuScale core with \"minimal effect on the reactor's design and operation\". The study also demonstrated that a 12-module NuScale plant with 100% MOX cores could consume a 100-tonne stockpile of plutonium in about 40 years, \"during which time it would generate approximately 200 million megawatt-hours of carbon free electricity\".",
            "NNL business leader for fuel and reactors Dan Mathers said, \"The National Nuclear Laboratory has been pleased to work with NuScale on a commercial basis to help demonstrate the capability of their SMR in relation to MOX fuel.\" He added, \"Reuse of the plutonium for low carbon power generation could be a valuable way forward for dealing with the UK's nuclear legacy.\"",
            "NuScale CEO John Hopkins said, \"This is an important step in the continued development of additional flexibility of the NuScale Power Module to operate on various fuel forms.\"",
            "Last October, NuScale said it aims to deploy its SMR technology in the UK with the first of its 50 MWe units in operation by the mid-2020s. The company is looking for partners to make this happen.",

The company wants to apply for design certification this year and it hopes to have its first unit in operation in late 2023, generating power in Idaho for prospective customer the Utah Association of Municipal Power Systems. NuScale, majority-owned by Fluor, plans a construction and operating licence (COL) application in late 2017 or early 2018. The company also expects to apply for a GDA in the UK in a similar timeframe.",
            "More than 100 tonnes of plutonium are currently stockpiled at the UK's Sellafield site in Cumbria. However, the government is considering options for its re-use or disposal.",
            "GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy's Prism and Candu Energy's Enhanced Candu 6 (EC6) reactors are seen as \"credible options\" for managing the UK's plutonium stockpile, according to the UK's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, but the government's preferred option for this remains reuse as MOX fuel. In early 2012, the NDA invited expressions of interest on potential alternative credible full lifecycle management options for managing the UK's plutonium stockpiles. The use of plutonium in MOX fuel had earlier been selected as the preferred route by the government. Four responses were received and the NDA shortlisted two of them - Prism and EC6 - for further consideration.",
            "NuScale said another option under consideration is Areva's Convert proposal, which would reprocess the UK's stockpile of plutonium into MOX fuel. Areva has already been working with NuScale, having signed a contract last month to manufacture conventional fuel assemblies for the NuScale Power Module and provide a variety of engineering and testing services associated with the NuScale design.",
            "Areva said it welcomed the results of the NNL study. In a statement today, it said: \"This is further evidence that Areva's Convert proposal, which would reprocess the UK's stockpile of plutonium into MOX fuel, is an advantageous solution to address the UK plutonium stockpile.\" It noted that its reprocessing technology \"is already commercially available, having been successfully industrially implemented and operational for more than 40 years with MOX fuel already used by 43 reactors worldwide\"."

            "The government said that eligibility to participate in the first phase will be determined using a set of criteria, which it published along with the request for expressions of interest. \"These criteria have been formulated to ensure that only credible organizations are accepted into the Phase One dialogue,\" DECC said. The deadline for applications to take part in the first phase is 6 May, with eligible participants being notified by 23 May. The Phase One dialogue is scheduled to begin in late May.",

It will also contain details of the process the government will use to identify \"suitable sites or types of sites\". In addition, the Roadmap will detail \"any work the government will undertake with the Office for Nuclear Regulation to ensure that appropriate provision is made within the process for regulatory approval, including through Generic Design Assessment\".",
            "DECC said it expects the first phase of the competition will run until late-2016 and intends to publish the Roadmap after the close of Phase One, in parallel with publication of plans for the next step in the SMR competition.",

Mark Menzies, member of parliament for the Fylde constituency where the company's Springfields site is located, said that he had already formally registered his support for Westinghouse's proposal to produce SMRs for the UK market. He said that feedback from stakeholders would be essential for as the proposal, which could see SMR pressure vessels sourced and manufactured in the UK, to move forward.",
            "The first phase of the competition, which will also lead to the development of an SMR Roadmap to set out the policy framework and assess the potential for possible pathways for SMRs in the UK, will run until late 2016. Individual reactor designs will not be assessed at this stage.",
            "The Weinberg report recommends a list of criteria that it says the government should use in selecting which designs to support during the second phase of the competition, with safety and non-proliferation of \"critical importance\". Cost, waste management, past experience with related designs, the ability to use alternative nuclear fuels, the ability to re-use used nuclear fuel and plutonium, flexibility to provide back-up for intermittent renewables and the potential to provide low-carbon heat and hydrogen are the other criteria that should be considered, the study says.",
            "At least one of the reactors supported should be a Generation IV design that could use fuel made from previously used reactor fuel and from the UK's plutonium stocks. It suggests that SMRs and \"micro-reactors\" - reactors of less than 20 MWe capacity - will be cheaper to construct than large reactors.",
            "It also supports a proposed increase in the resources of the UK's Office for Nuclear Regulation, citing a lack of regulatory capacity as a \"significant barrier\" to nuclear innovation in the UK. The ONR's rigorous generic design assessment (GDA) process for a reactor design can take up to five years, but the regulator only has the resources to carry out two such exercises at the same time. At the moment it is assessing the AP1000 and Advanced Boiling Water Reactor designs - both Generation III+ reactors - and will not be able to begin assessing any other design until one of those GDAs has been completed.",
            "Finally, the report proposes that UK regulators cooperate with their peers in other countries, citing US and Canadian regulatory practices where proposed reactor designs are discussed with developers before the formal regulatory process begins. It calls for a three-way collaboration to be established with the aim of establishing international standards for the safety of advanced reactors.",
            "The report's author, Stephen Tindale, said: \"The UK’s energy mix must be based on diversity. So the policy argument should not be whether to support solar, wind, [carbon capture and storage] or nuclear. 'All of the above' will be needed. Existing nuclear technology is very good, but future nuclear technology can be even better. If the £250 million is sensibly spent, it could contribute to the UK becoming a world leader in both small and Generation IV reactors.\"",

            "The report said the UK's energy policy should \"balance cost against energy and environmental concerns\". It added, \"We recommend that the government negotiate a strike price for Wylfa Newydd below that agreed for Hinkley Point C and seek a price that would be competitive with renewable sources, such as on-shore wind. The government should not continue with the project if the price is too high.\"",
            "\"We believe that Wylfa Newydd can deliver value for money and deliver a significant portion of the country's future energy needs,\" the committee concluded. \"To achieve this, the developers and the government will need to manage potential delays and bottlenecks, to keep costs down and the project on schedule.\"",
            "The report recommends the UK government puts in place a contingency plan \"to fill the gap in the energy supply\" if there is a delayed start to the Wylfa Newydd project.",
            "\"The nuclear industry has made a major contribution to the economy of North Wales, and Wylfa Newydd would make a strong contribution in the future,\" it said. \"Without the nuclear power industry, there is little prospect of many high-quality, well-paid jobs in the area, which will negatively affect the local economy.\"",
            "The committee said it is surprised the government's plans for nuclear skills development in the UK does not have \"a Welsh dimension\". It recommends the UK government sets out plans to create a North Wales campus for the National Nuclear College, announced in May this year.",
            "Last November, the government announced plans to invest at least £250 million ($352 million) over the next five years in an \"ambitious\" nuclear research and development program to include a competition to identify the best value SMR design for the UK.",
            "\"It is clear that Trawsfynydd would be an ideal site for a first-of-a-kind SMR,\" the committee suggests. \"The availability of cooling water and the grid connections mean it would meet the technical requirements, and its history as a nuclear site and its ownership by the government mean that it would be easy to designate it as a site for SMR development. The presence of a skilled workforce, which is strongly in favour of the project, would also be a major boost to SMR development.\"",
            "North Wales is well positioned near centres of nuclear excellence in north-west England and needs investment to stimulate the economy, the report said."

Amec Foster Wheeler, Nuvia and Arup, together with the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, are working with Rolls-Royce to develop the latest technology reactors, a spokesman for the British engineering firm told",
            "today. \"Other names will emerge in due course,\" he added.",
            "In October last year, Rolls-Royce said a UK SMR could provide a £100 billion ($127 billion) boost to the UK economy between 2030 and 2050 because the companies involved are either UK-owned or have a strong UK presence. The latest announcement comes as British ministers are looking to support the development of SMRs and civil nuclear innovation, with up to £250 million in funding, and also to publish a green paper on Industrial Strategy later this month.",
            "The spokesman said Rolls-Royce is teaming up with a \"raft of British engineering giants\" in a bid to make SMRs a reality in the UK, creating up to 40,000 high-value British jobs and intellectual property, and opening up a £400 billion export market.",
            "\"We are working with some of Britain's most experienced civil engineering companies and nuclear research organisations to realise the huge potential of small modular reactors for the wider UK economy. We share a common belief that a home-grown SMR program can play a key role in strengthening the UK's energy mix and security, while creating valuable intellectual property, exports and jobs. We are working together to deliver a whole power plant which could be up and running in just over a decade and provide a boost for the UK's industrial strategy.\"",
            "The companies are looking to create a partnership which will build entire running power plants \"capable of powering a city the size of Leeds\" - which has a population of about 750,000 people. Once the initial design is licensed, parts can be made on a factory production line relatively cheaply, the spokesman said.",

            "Terrestrial Energy USA announced today it had informed the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of its plans to license a small modular reactor (SMR) in the USA. Terrestrial said it intends to start \"pre-application interactions\" with the regulator this year and to make its licensing application in late 2019.",
            "The NRC recently published a letter from Terrestrial responding to the agency's Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) published on 7 June last year. An RIS is an NRC request for information regarding future nuclear reactor licence filings.",
            "In its letter, dated 18 November 2016, Terrestrial said it plans to submit an application to the NRC for a design certification or a construction permit \"no later than October 2019\".",
            "Terrestrial included the status of the design, analyses, testing, licensing, and project planning for its Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR), which is a liquid-fuelled, high-temperature, 400 MWt advanced reactor power plant design.",
            "The NRC is developing a specific licensing framework for advanced reactor designs, Terrestrial noted, adding it has \"confidence in the capability\" of the regulator to review and reach safety, security, and environmental findings on the IMSR design, \"in a timely manner\".",
            "Terrestrial Energy CEO Simon Irish said in today's statement: \"This is a very exciting time for the nuclear power industry. We are moving forward with the design and regulatory actions needed to allow the company to bring the IMSR to market in the 2020s. The IMSR's design choices will result in an advanced reactor that delivers clean, cost-competitive and high-grade industrial heat. This capability can serve the many and varied heat requirements of industry, and as well as those of the electric power sector where the IMSR's dispatchablity will be greatly prized.\"",
            "Terrestrial is examining four sites for its first commercial plant, which include the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and additional sites east of the Mississippi River.",
            "Terrestrial says the IMSR \"extends the applicability of nuclear energy far beyond its current footprint in on-grid electric power markets\" and \"promises to increase industrial competitiveness and energy security while concurrently driving deep and rapid decarbonization by displacing fossil fuel combustion across a broad industrial front\".",
            "Molten salt reactors use fuel dissolved in a molten fluoride or chloride salt which functions as both the fuel (producing the heat) and the coolant (transporting the heat away and ultimately to the power plant). This means that such a reactor could not suffer from a loss of coolant leading to a meltdown. Terrestrial's IMSR integrates the primary reactor components, including primary heat exchangers to secondary clean salt circuit, in a sealed and replaceable core vessel. It is designed as a modular reactor for factory fabrication, and could be used for electricity production and industrial process heat generation.",
            "Last year, New York-headquartered Terrestrial Energy USA's parent, Canada's Terrestrial Energy Inc, announced its plans to engage with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission in a pre-licensing design review, a first step towards an eventual licence application.",
            "NuScale Power announced on 13 January that it had asked the NRC to approve the Portland, Oregon-based company's SMR commercial power plant design - the first-ever SMR design certification application to be submitted to the agency. The first commercial 12-module NuScale power plant is planned to be built on the site of the INL. It will be owned by the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems and operated by Energy Northwest."

            "A consortium of small modular reactor (SMR) developers and customers has issued a policy statement setting out the benefits of public-private partnerships to facilitate the commercialisation and export of US-designed SMRs.",
            "The SMR Start consortium, which was launched in January 2016, said SMRs were a \"strategic option\" for the US to meet the need for new generation capacity from the mid-2020s onwards. Commercialisation of new nuclear technologies involves large upfront first-of-a-kind costs and a relatively long timeframe to complete licensing and design activities, the consortium said. Investment of such amounts, over the timeframes required and without contractual commitments, presented a \"unique challenge\" to companies, the consortium said.",
            "Public-private partnerships - similar to those that provide support for the introduction of other new energy technologies - would help ensure the successful commercialisation of SMRs, the consortium said, stimulating the private investments required to ensure that the technology continues to advance and is capable of competing in overseas markets without additional direct support once the technology matures. \"Such partnerships are an appropriate policy due to the public benefits derived from SMRs that are not valued in the energy markets, such as carbon-free generation and improved electricity grid reliability\", it said.",
            "The policy document called on the US government to establish public-private partnerships to support the development of two or more SMR designs, the deployment of four or more commercial SMR facilities domestically, and the development of a domestic supply chain to support the SMR market, including the export of SMRs.",
            "It said the US Department of Energy's (DoE's) SMR Licensing Technical Support (LTS) program, providing initial funding of up to $452 million on a cost share basis, was \"much appreciated but not sufficient in the current business environment to achieve large-scale SMR commercialisation.\" It called for the LTS program, scheduled to end in fiscal 2017, to be expanded to cover design finalisation as well as licensing and to be extended to fiscal 2025, \"with a commensurate increase in funding\".",
            "Public-private partnerships could support the deployment of SMRs through a combination of production tax credits, power purchase agreements and loan guarantees, the consortium said. Technology development could be supported through grid security and reliability programs and accelerated through access to and support from national laboratories.",
            "Investment tax credits (ITC) could support investments in SMR design and construction, and \"kick-start\" a supply chain and the manufacturing of components for both domestic and international SMR markets. \"One SMR designer has invested in excess of $300 million in a state-of-the-art purpose-built SMR manufacturing facility in the US\", it noted. \"An SMR ITC should be established to incentivise investments in US SMR manufacturing facilities. This is similar in amount to the ITC for renewable energy sources\", it said.",
            "\"Private companies and DoE have invested over $1 billion in the development of SMRs. However, more investment, through public-private partnerships is needed in order to assure that SMRs are a viable option in the mid-2020s. In addition to accomplishing the public benefit from SMR deployment, the federal government would receive a return on investment through taxes associated with investment, job creation and economic output over the lifetime of the SMR facilities that would otherwise not exist without the US government's investment,\" the consortium said.",
            "SMRs can generally be described as nuclear reactors with a typical capacity of 300 MWe equivalent or less, designed with modular technology using module factory fabrication, allowing economies of series production and short construction times. The DoE has supported their development through several initiatives.",
            "Earlier this year NuScale Power submitted the first-ever SMR design certification application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with a preferred site identified at the Idaho National Laboratory for a potential first-of-a-kind reactor. The regulator has also accepted for review from the Tennessee Valley Authority an application for an early site permit for a potential SMR at Clinch River in Tennessee. The application was developed with the support of the DoE's LTS program.",
            "SMR Start was established by SMR vendors and potential customers to advocate for SMRs in the USA. Its members are Areva, Bechtel, BWXT, Dominion, Duke Energy, Energy Northwest, Fluor, Holtec International, NuScale Power, Ontario Power Generation, PSEG Nuclear, Southern Nuclear, the Tennessee Valley Authority and Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems. The US Nuclear Energy Institute collaborates with the consortium on policies and priorities relating to SMR technology."

            "GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) and Advanced Reactor Concepts (ARC Nuclear) have signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on the development and licensing of a small modular reactor (SMR). Each company has so far been developing its own sodium-cooled fast reactor models.",
            "They have agreed to enter into a \"pro-competitive collaboration\" to jointly develop an SMR design, with initial deployment in Canada. They will seek a preliminary regulatory review by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) through its Vendor Design Review process. This, they said, will build on earlier technology licensing success in the USA.",
            "The collaboration will also include the near-term objectives of confirming projected construction and operating costs, as well as the identification of a lead plant owner/operator for the reactor.",
            "Both GEH and ARC have developed reactor designs based on the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) integral sodium-cooled fast reactor prototype at the Argonne National Laboratory. EBR-II began operations in 1961 at Idaho Falls and had a thermal power output of 62.5 MW and an electrical output of 20 MW. The reactor was later used to generate electricity for other site facilities. EBR-II was used for testing materials and design concepts to improve reactor safety, culminating in testing of the inherently safe Integral Fast Reactor concept in 1986. The reactor was shut down in 1994.",
            "GEH's Prism reactor has a rated thermal power of 840 MWt and an output of 311 MWe. Two Prism reactors make up a power block, producing a combined total of 622 MWe of electrical output. Using passive safety, digital instrumentation and control, and modular fabrication techniques to expedite plant construction, the design uses metallic fuel, such as an alloy of zirconium, uranium, and plutonium. It can therefore be used to close the nuclear fuel cycle, recycling used nuclear fuel to generate energy. It is designed to be refuelled every 12-24 months. GEH has previously proposed the Prism reactor as a possible option for managing the UK's plutonium stockpile.",
            "ARC's ARC-100 modular 100 MWe model would use a 'novel' metal alloy fuel, with the uranium-fuelled reactor core submerged in a tank of liquid sodium at ambient pressure. It would have a refuelling interval of 20 years.",
            "\"GEH has broad engineering experience, deep technical capability and significant investment in its sodium fast reactor technology program that builds on a 60-year history as an original equipment manufacturer of more than 60 boiling water reactors worldwide,\" said the company's president and CEO Jay Wileman. \"The ARC Nuclear team brings decades of sodium fast reactor experience to this collaboration and, by working together, we can accelerate commercialisation of this technology.\"",
            "ARC Nuclear chairman and CEO Don Wolf said, \"ARC Nuclear has a heritage of sodium fast reactor experience that includes key senior scientists and engineers from the EBR-II prototype program - technical leaders involved in developing and demonstrating the fast reactor foundational technology with the US Department of Energy.\" He added, \"We are confident that this collaboration with GEH will more rapidly bring affordable carbon free, utility-scale nuclear power to the evolving energy market landscape.\"",
            "Last October, GEH and Southern Nuclear signed an MoU to collaborate on the development and licensing of fast reactors including GEH's Prism. The companies also agreed to work together in future US Department of Energy advanced reactor licensing programs.",
            "Earlier this month, the U-Battery consortium - led by Urenco - registered its micro-modular reactor technology for pre-licensing Vendor Design Review with the CNSC. The U-Battery is a 'micro' nuclear reactor which will be able to produce local power and heat for a range of energy needs, mainly targeting the markets for industrial power units and off-grid locations. Powered by Triso fuel, each helium gas-cooled unit produces 10 MWt, can deliver up to 4 MWe as electricity and can provide 750°C of process heat."

            "CNL will combine federal and commercial priorities and needs into four application-driven research and technology development programs: energy, including work on life extension of existing reactors, fabrication of advanced nuclear fuel, the deployment of SMRs and decarbonisation of the transport sector; health, including radiobiology research and targeted alpha therapy; safety and security, including nuclear cyber security and nuclear forensics and response; and environment, including environmental stewardship and radioactive waste management.",
            "Over the next ten years, the Chalk River site will be \"strategically consolidated and modernised\" to support the nuclear research needs of the Canadian government and the science and technology needs of the Canadian and global nuclear industry. Over CAD1.2 billion will be invested in infrastructure and facilities, enabling the construction of an Advanced Nuclear Materials Research Centre complex, with new shielded facilities advanced active laboratories for research involving active or irradiated materials. A new electrical switchyard, expanded natural gas service, potable water lines, and sanitary sewer system will improve the safety and reliability of the current systems; and modern, energy efficient facilities will be constructed to accommodate maintenance and operations activities, logistics and security, as well as a new business centre.",
            "The strategy's science and technology goals include the siting of a new SMR by 2026; development and demonstration of a suite of targeted alpha therapy compounds by 2022; the expansion of CNL's hydrogen program, aiming to play a leading role in the demonstration of hydrogen-based bulk transport by 2020; the demonstration of a new advanced fuel fabrication concept by 2020; and the development, commercialisation and deployment of a nuclear industrial control cyber intrusion detection and mitigation system by 2022.",

            "Costs could be of the order of CDN600 million, with expected contributions from commercial entities, and executed through extensive partnering with technology vendors and end users, although the budget estimate will be refined over time through a non-binding call for expressions of interest. With an SMR sited at CNL, funding would be expected to increase as demand for CNL's S&T support from SMR vendors grows.",

The plant will use 'pebbles' of fuel containing Triso fuel particles. Each Triso particle has a kernel of uranium oxycarbide (also known as UCO) enriched to 15.5% uranium-235, encased in carbon and ceramic layers which prevent the release of radioactivity. The layers provide each particle with its own independent containment system, while the graphite surrounding the particles moderates the nuclear reaction. Such fuel cannot melt down.",

            "In December 2016, NuScale submitted the first-ever SMR Design Certification Application (DCA) to the NRC, which the latter accepted on 15 March 2017. The application consisted of nearly 12,000 pages of technical information.",
            "Dale Atkinson, NuScale's chief operating officer and chief nuclear officer, said: \"We appreciate the NRC staff's focused and thorough analysis of the safety and reliability our SMR design offers and for issuing their findings so early in our DCA review.\"",
            "He added, \"Our approach to safety is a first in the nuclear industry and exemplifies the inherent safety of NuScale's SMR. This validation brings us another step closer to achieving our mission of delivering scalable advanced nuclear technology to produce the electricity, process heat and clean water needed to improve the quality of life for people around the world.\"",
            "Last July, the NRC concluded that the highly integrated protection system platform developed for NuScale's SMR is acceptable for use in plant safety-related instrumentation and control systems. The hybrid analog and digital logic-based system comprises the safety function, communications, equipment interface and hardwired modules. All the modules operate independently and asynchronously.",
            "The NRC's final report approving the reactor design is expected to be completed by September 2020. Once issued, a design certification is valid for 15 years in support of a combined licence application to construct and operate a power plant.",
            "The first commercial NuScale power plant is planned for construction on the site of the Idaho National Laboratory for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems and operated by Energy Northwest."

            "CORRECTED: The original version of this story gave an incorrect figure for the value of nuclear tax credits under the 2005 Energy Policy Act.",
            "The USA has extended production tax credits for advanced nuclear power plants under a budget bill signed into law by President Donald Trump. The nuclear production tax credit is seen as an essential component for the completion of US plants already under construction and for first-of-a-kind small modular reactor (SMR) construction.",
            "Workers at Vogtle are briefed before the installation of unit 3's pressuriser in January - a key milestone for the project (Image: Georgia Power)",
            "HR 1892 - the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 - was passed by the US Senate and Congress in the early hours of 9 February and signed into law by the President later the same day, ending a brief government shutdown. The act, which includes defence and domestic spending with funding for healthcare and infrastructure, gained bipartisan support in both houses.",
            "Nuclear production tax credits were created under the 2005 Energy Policy Act to provide federal support for projects such as Georgia Power's Vogtle units 3 and 4. The credit was set at 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity over eight years, subject to limitations. To be eligible for the credit, plants were required to enter commercial operation by the end of 2020; however the Vogtle plants are not expected to enter service until November 2021 (unit 3) and November 2022 (unit 4).",
            "Section 40501 of the new law allows reactors entering service after 31 December 2020 to qualify for the tax credits, and enables the US Energy Secretary to allocate credits for up to 6000 MWe of new nuclear capacity which enters service after 1 January 2021. It also allows public entity partners in the projects - such as Vogtle's minority owners Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and the city of Dalton - to transfer their credits to other credit partners.",
            "The 2021 deadline means that the two Vogtle units will be eligible for the tax credits. Other projects, such as NuScale Power's plans to build its first commercial SMR plant at the Idaho National Laboratory by 2026, will also now be able to benefit.",
            "Georgia Power's recommendation to continue with the construction of the two AP1000 reactors at Vogtle, following contractor Westinghouse's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in March last year, received approval from the state's public service commission in December.",
            "Federal support and \"constructive legislation\" continue to be an important key to the project's success, the company said. The new law further reduces the risk for the continuing construction of the units, for which the company also holds more than $5 billion in anticipated loan guarantees from the Department of Energy.",
            "The company praised members of Congress for voting to approve the legislation to extend the tax credits deadline, led by Senator Johnny Isakson.",
            "\"We are grateful to Senator Isakson for his leadership on this issue, and to the entire Georgia delegation for recognising the importance of new nuclear generation and demonstrating renewed federal support for the Vogtle project,\" he said. \"At Georgia Power, we are focused on delivering value to our customers every day and we're committed to completing these new units.\"",
            "Maria Korsnick, president and CEO of the US Nuclear Energy Institute, said the vote was \"a vote for continued American leadership in nuclear energy, environmental stewardship and thousands of jobs\", with tax credits supplying an essential component to complete construction of the Vogtle plant and also paving the way to build NuScale's Idaho SMR.",
            "\"Both projects will serve as anchors for energy infrastructure … as they generate carbon-free electricity, spur economic growth and support a diverse and reliable electric grid for decades to come,\" she said."

            "The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) is to conduct pre-licensing vendor design reviews (VDRs) of small modular reactor designs from NuScale Power and Westinghouse Electric Company. The reviews of the NuScale SMR and Westinghouse's eVinci micro reactor will incorporate the first two phases of the VDR process.",
            "Westinghouse's vision of its eVinci micro reactor (Image: Westinghouse)",
            "The CNSC offers the pre-licensing VDR as an optional service to provide an assessment of a nuclear power plant design based on a vendor's reactor technology. It is not a required part of the licensing process for a new nuclear power plant, but aims to verify the acceptability of a design with respect to Canadian nuclear regulatory requirements and expectations.",
            "The three phases of the VDR process involve a pre-licensing assessment of compliance with regulatory requirements; an assessment of any potential fundamental barriers to licensing; and a follow-up phase allowing the vendor to respond to findings from the second phase.",
            "The regulator said yesterday it had received applications for VDRs from NuScale Power and Westinghouse. It expects to begin the VDR for the NuScale design in mid-2018, but has not yet determined when it expects to start the review for the eVinci design. Given that both designs have progressed beyond the basic engineering phase, the CNSC said the first two stages of the VDR can be combined.",
            "The CNSC is now involved with ten pre-licensing VDRs, all for small reactors with capacities in the range of 3-300 MWe.",
            "NuScale's self-contained 50 MWe integral pressurised water reactor design houses the reactor core, pressuriser and steam generator inside a single containment vessel. A power plant could include up to 12 power modules, each 25 metres in length, 4.6m in diameter and weighing around 450 tonnes. Each module incorporates simple, redundant, diverse, and independent safety features.",
            "The company in December 2016 applied for US regulatory design certification. The first commercial 12-module power plant, which will be owned by Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems and run by an experienced nuclear operator, Energy Northwest, is planned for construction on land owned by the US Department of Energy at the Idaho National Laboratory. It intends to apply for generic design assessment in the UK.",
            "Westinghouse is developing the eVinci micro reactor as a small nuclear energy generator for decentralised generation markets, such as remote communities, or arctic mines. The company says the reactor design is a combination of nuclear fission, space reactor technologies and over 50 years of commercial nuclear systems design, engineering and innovation.",
            "The reactor has a solid core, built around a solid steel monolith with channels for fuel pellets and heat pipes that remove heat from the core, and has minimal moving parts. Fuel is encapsulated in the core, which the company says significantly reduces proliferation risk and enhances overall safety for the user. The heat pipes enable passive core heat extraction and inherent power regulation, allowing autonomous operation and inherent load following capabilities.",
            "The reactor is designed to run for more than ten years without refuelling. It can provide combined heat and power from 200 kWe to 25 MWe, and process heat up to 600 degrees Celsius.",
            "Westinghouse said in October last year it aims to develop and demonstrate the eVinci reactor in less than six years, a timescale it says is possible primarily due to the small size and high technology readiness level of the individual components. The company plans to develop a full-scale electrical demonstration unit to reduce technology gaps and demonstrate manufacturability by 2019, and aims to qualify the eVinci micro reactor for commercial deployment by 2024."

            "A memorandum of understanding signed by Holtec International and Energoatom envisages the adoption by Ukraine of Holtec's small modular reactor (SMR) technology with the country becoming a manufacturing hub for SMR-160 reactor components. Separately, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has begun a technical review of an application by Holtec for a consolidated spent fuel interim storage facility proposed for southeastern New Mexico.",
            "Holtec CEO Kris Singh and Energoatom president Yury Nedashkovsky sign the MOU (Image: Holtec)",
            "Holtec's SMR subsidiary is working to commercialise the 160 MWe factory-built SMR, which uses low-enriched uranium fuel. The passively safe reactor's core and all nuclear steam supply system components would be located underground. The design has the flexibility to be used in remote locations, or in areas with limited water supplies or land, according to the company.",
            "The memorandum signed in Camden, New Jersey, includes the licensing and construction of SMR-160 reactors in Ukraine, as well as the partial localisation of SMR-160 components. The Ukrainian manufacturing hub is to mirror the capabilities of Holtec's Advanced Manufacturing Plant in Camden, and will be one of four manufacturing plants Holtec plans to build at distributed sites around the world by the mid-2020s. The memorandum of understanding will be implemented through a joint coordinating committee.",
            "The NRC yesterday said it has formally docketed an application by Holtec to construct and operate a consolidated interim storage facility for used fuel from commercial nuclear power reactors in Lea County, New Mexico. The regulator has determined the application is sufficiently complete for detailed safety, security and environmental reviews to begin.",
            "Holtec is seeking to store up to 8680 tonnes of uranium in commercial used fuel using its Hi-Storm UMax storage system, for a 40-year licence term.",
            "Holtec also said it is in talks with \"leading Ukrainian suppliers\" of speciality machinery such as turbo-generators to integrate their products into SMR-160.",
            "Energoatom's president, Yury Nedashkovsky, is an active member of the Holtec Advisory Council. Holtec said he has told the Council that Energoatom intends to replace two VVER-440 reactors at the Rovno nuclear power plant with SMR-160s. Nedashkovsky cited SMR-160's \"walk-away\" safe design and Energoatom's \"trust and confidence\" in Holtec, based on the companies' long-term business relationship, as reasons behind Energoatom's selection of Holtec's reactor system.",
            "Holtec's 160 MWe factory-built SMR uses low-enriched uranium fuel. The factory-built reactor's core and all nuclear steam supply system components would be located underground, and the design incorporates a wealth of features including a passive cooling system that would be able to operate indefinitely after shutdown. No active components, such as pumps, are needed to run the reactor, which does not need any on-site or off-site power to shut down and to dissipate decay heat. The SMR-160 is planned for operation by 2026.",
            "The SMR-160 was selected by the US Department of Energy in 2012 as one of three SMR projects to be demonstrated potentially at its Savannah River site in South Carolina. The NRC is carrying out pre-application activities on the reactor design. Holtec International and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy in February announced a collaboration to accelerate the commercialisation of SMR-160.",
            "Holtec has also applied for a pre-licensing vendor design review for SMR-160 by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commision, and last year signed a teaming agreement with Canada's SNC-Lavalin to collaborate in the development of reactor. Under that agreement, SNC-Lavalin - the parent company of Candu Energy - will provide Holtec with a range of nuclear engineering services, including supporting the licensing of the SMR-160 reactor."

            "The design concept for an RDE plant (Image: Batan)",
            "The detailed engineering design roadmap - part of Batan's RDE pre-project phase - was announced on 7 March by Geni Rina Sunaryo, Batan's director of nuclear reactor safety and technology. The roadmap is a continuation of the RDE basic engineering design, which was completed in 2017.",
            "Batan said the detailed engineering design document, together with the safety analysis report, will be an important requirement for it to achieve approval for the RDE design from the Indonesia's Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency (Bapeten).",
            "Batan said it aims to complete the RDE detailed engineering design this year by involving a consortium of Indonesian universities and private companies. It plans to have the first draft of the detailed engineering design ready for review in June by an expert mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It will follow up recommendations from that review by September. The Indonesian government aims to announce the design to the global community during this year's IAEA General Conference, Batan said.",
            "\"The detailed design means that the design is close to construction, and the ultimate goal is to determine how much the RDE will cost,\" Sunaryo said.",
            "Batan launched a plan in 2014 to build an 10 MWt RDE at its largest research centre site - the Puspiptek Complex, in Serpong, South Tangerang, Banten - as a first strategic milestone for the introduction of large-scale nuclear power plant fleets into the country. The RDE is a very small sized pebble-bed high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) with low enriched uranium oxide TRISO fuel.",
            "The main objective of the plan is to demonstrate Indonesia's ability to build and safely operate nuclear power stations to meet the needs of the country's society and economy. Batan intends the design and technology of the reactor to be suitable for subsequent commercial use by utilities and independent power producers around the country, as well as for export.",
            "Batan began the pre-project phase in 2015 in cooperation with Russian-Indonesian consortium RENUKO as consultant for conceptual design. The RENUKO consortium includes Indonesian companies Rekayasa Engineering and Kogas Driyap Consultant, as well as Germany's NUKEM Technologies GmbH and subsidiaries of Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom.",
            "Last year, Batan received a siting licence from Bapeten for the demonstration RDE reactor at its Serpong complex.",
            "Batan will also begin construction later this year of a system test facility that will demonstrate Indonesia's ability to design and build a portion of the RDE itself. The test results from the facility will be used as input data in the RDE's design.",
            "Batan is promoting the introduction of nuclear power plants in Indonesia to help meet the county's demand for power. It envisages the start-up of conventional large light-water reactors on the populous islands of Bali, Java, Madura and Sumatra from 2027 onwards. In addition, it is planning for the deployment of small HTGRs (up to 100 MWe) on Kalimantan, Sulawesi and other islands to supply power and heat for industrial use."

            "\"Historically, France has been the centre of nuclear expertise in the world,\" noted Thorizon CEO Kiki Lauwers. \"It is therefore important for us to also have a physical presence there. Especially since we collaborate with the French company Orano, a recognised international operator in the field of nuclear materials, in particular through the recycling of nuclear materials into new fuel for a facility like ours. Together with them, we want to make nuclear energy more circular.\"",
            "In addition to Orano, and French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), two research institutes in Lille, French consultancy firm Oakridge, the engineering company Tractebel, NRG-Pallas in Petten, and Differ in Eindhoven are also part of the project.",

            "Meanwhile, French chloride molten salt reactor developer Stellaria - a spin-off from the CEA - has also announced funding from France 2030.",
            "The reactor proposed by Stellaria and its partners CEA, Technip Energies and Schneider Electric will be very compact - measuring 4 cubic metres - and will be able to use a diversified range of nuclear fuels (uranium, plutonium, MOX, minor actinides, even thorium). The reactor, which Stellaria says is \"the world's first fast neutron reactor capable of renewing 100% of its fuel in its core during operation\" - will produce 250 MWt/110 MWe.",
            "It said the consortium with Orano \"enables the necessary acceleration of synchronised R&D between fuels and reactors\".",
            "Together with its partners, Stellaria aims to commission its first reactor in 2033, and series reactors as early as 2035.",

TVA has yet to decide whether to actually construct such reactors at the site and, if so, what technology it would use.",

The permit is valid for 10 to 20 years, renewable for an additional 10 to 20 years.",
            "TVA submitted its 8000-page ESP application for the Clinch River site to the NRC in May 2016. The application was for two or more small modular reactor (SMR) modules of up to a combined capacity of 800 MWe at the 935 acre (378 hectare) site near the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The proposed site hosted the former Clinch River Breeder Reactor Project. The NRC accepted the application for regulatory review in December of that year. It was the first SMR-related application of any type to be received by the NRC. The regulator published a final environmental impact statement for the permit in April this year, followed in June by its final safety evaluation report on TVA's application.",
            "The Commission has now authorised the agency's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation to issue the ESP to TVA. The NRC said the permit is expected to be issued in the next few days.",
            "The permit, the NRC said, includes additional provisions - including approved analysis methods - that deal with the NRC's emergency preparedness regulations. This could allow a future licence applicant at the Clinch River site to request an emergency preparedness zone smaller than those found at current US nuclear power plants.",
            "SMR units, typically with a capacity of 300 MWe equivalent or less, are designed using modular technology and factory fabrication. This allows for economies of series production and short construction times. Multiple units can be installed at one location to provide the total required capacity. Such reactors are seen as potentially offering improved safety and security, as well as more standardisation, more site options and lower financing costs compared to conventional light-water reactors.",
            "Dan Stout, director of nuclear technology innovation at TVA, said: \"Although we have no plans to build at this time, this permit will give TVA flexible options to prepare for future energy needs.\"",
            "TVA Chief Nuclear Officer Tim Rausch added: \"The decision to build will be based on energy needs and economic factors - we want to make the best decision for the people of the Valley.\"",

Given the very high proportion of the cost of energy that the capital repayment element makes up of the overall cost of power from a nuclear plant, the effective interest rate is fundamental to project viability.\"",
            "The six options identified by NIASA are: either state funding for the entire project or with state-backed loan guarantees and using reserves and cash flows from state-owned companies; an intergovernmental loan; corporate financing; financing by the plant vendor; project financing using a special investment vehicle; and 'build-own-operate'.",
            "The association provided real-world examples of the application of five of the funding models in nuclear power plant projects. One option - project financing using a special purpose vehicle set up solely to fund the specific project and segregating the project from other investments, has not yet been used to fund a nuclear power plant but it has been used for natural gas generation plants, NIASA said.",

            "\"So that the hydrogen produced by electrolysis is low carbon, it is necessary to use electricity that is 'green' - from renewable energy - or 'yellow' - from nuclear power,\" OPECST said, but it would cost four times more to produce hydrogen from renewables than from a small modular reactor.",
            "\"The investments being high, electrolysers must be made profitable by lengthening the duration of their use (a minimum threshold of 5000 hours per year and an optimal threshold of up to 8000 h/year), which the intermittence of renewables does not allow (2000-4000 h/year). In this regard, only nuclear energy and hydroelectricity present the double advantage of being controllable and carbon-free,\" the report says.",
            "The European Union's target to install 6 GW of electrolysers for the production of one million tonnes of hydrogen from renewables by 2024 and then 40 GW for 10 million tonnes by 2030, would require, respectively, at least 15,000 and 150,000 wind turbines, or solar PV panels covering an area of about 800,000 hectares and eight million hectares.",

            "In November it was announced that the service life of Metsamor’s unit 2 had been extended to 2026, after collaboration with Rosatom, with plans for a further 10-year extension.",
            "Armenia has long been in discussions with Russia about replacing Metsamor, which comprises two Russian-built 376 MWe VVER reactors which started operating in 1976 and 1980, respectively. Both units were taken off line in 1988 due to safety concerns regarding seismic vulnerability. Unit 2 was restarted in 1995, and accounts for some 39% of total electricity generation in the country.",
            "Evgeny Pakermanov, president of Rusatom Overseas, said, after signing the Memorandum of Understanding, that cooperation \"on the construction of new nuclear power units will no doubt become an important factor not only for the development of Armenia’s economy and growth of its welfare, but for further reinforcement of friendly neighbour relations between our two countries\".",
            "Eduard Martirosyan, director general of the Armenian nuclear power plant, said the country was \"closely following global decarbonisation trends\".",
            "He said the existing nuclear power plant \"generates about 40% of all electrical power in the country and since 1977 has been a clean and reliable source of power\".",
            "\"When its service life reaches its end, we would like to keep nuclear power in the country’s energy mix - that is why we are now considering our future with modern Russian nuclear technologies since they are some of the most advanced in the world,\" he added.",

TRISO fuel particles - each less than a millimetre in diameter - contain a kernel of enriched uranium oxycarbide surrounded by layers of carbon and silicon carbide, giving a containment for fission products which is stable to over 1600°C. It has been described as the most robust nuclear fuel in the world.",
            "X-energy's reactor technology is receiving funding under the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) as part of a $3.2 billion program to develop, build, and demonstrate operational advanced reactors by the end of the decade. The TRISO-X nuclear fuel produced in the Oak Ridge facility will be used in Xe-100 reactors, the first of which is expected to be operational by 2028 at a site in Washington state.",
            "TRISO-X earlier this year submitted a licence application for the TF3 to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Initially, the facility will produce 8 tonnes of fuel per year, supporting about 16 advanced reactors including the Xe-100, and is envisaged to increase to 16 tonnes per year by the early 2030s.",
            "\"TRISO-X will be the nation's first commercial scale facility dedicated to fuelling reactors that require high-assay low-enriched uranium TRISO particles,\" said US Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Kathryn Huff. \"It's a job creator and an advanced reactor enabler that will help fuel a transition to a net-zero economy.\"",

            "Carrying out the TWIST experiment at TREAT (Image: Idaho National Laboratory)",
            "The experiment, known as the TWIST experiment, uses a specially developed experiment holder - the TWIST capsule - to hold a fuel sample surrounded by water, which can be rapidly drained during testing. The TREAT Facility produces transient pulses - short, sudden bursts of energy that are five times more powerful than a commercial reactor - which, together with the TWIST capsule, can simulate loss of coolant accident (LOCA) conditions in a controlled environment.",
            "LOCA testing is a key part of assessing the behaviour of nuclear fuels and materials, to ensure that equipment maintains its intended safety function should an accident occur when a reactor core loses its cooling water more rapidly than it can be replaced. However, the USA has not been able to perform LOCA tests since Idaho National Laboratory's Power Burst Facility shut down in the mid-1980s. Since then, it has collaborated with Norway to carry out safety tests using the Halden Boiling Water Reactor, but since that reactor closed in 2018, LOCA testing has only been possible in one test reactor in Russia.",
            "The TWIST experiment restores the USA's ability to perform LOCA testing and supports the development of accident tolerant fuels that could extend operating cycles and reduce the amount fuel needed to operate commercial reactors, according to the Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy.",
            "\"Loss of coolant accident testing is essential to developing new fuels that will boost the performance of our nuclear power plants and help them run more efficiently,\" said Bill McCaughey, director of advanced fuel technologies for the Office of Nuclear Energy.",
            "The TREAT facility was built in the 1950s, originally to test fast reactor fuels. It was placed on standby in 1994, but the Department of Energy in 2013 proposed re-establishing the capability to conduct transient testing to aid in the development of new, advanced, safer and more efficient reactor fuels, leading to a decision to restart the facility. TREAT restarted in 2017 and resumed operations in 2018.",
            "Idaho National Laboratory made modifications to TREAT to accommodate a larger experiment rig that can be used by TWIST and future experiments at the facility and will also be used for upcoming sodium loop tests to support the development of TerraPower’s Natrium small modular reactor.",

            "\"We are immensely proud to continue investing in Canada and to grow our presence in this dynamic energy market,\" said Westinghouse President and CEO Patrick Fragman. \"Today, Westinghouse has more than 250 employees based in Canada across a diverse range of technical and professional roles. The new engineering hub in Kitchener will expand our employee base with approximately 100 additional engineers by 2025. This - coupled with our robust domestic supply chain and our proven technology offerings - uniquely positions Westinghouse to meet Canada’s clean energy needs for generations to come.\"",

            "Ontario Power Generation (OPG) announced in March that early phase works for the Darlington New Nuclear Project to construct the first of up to four BWRX-300 SMRs had been completed on time and on budget, clearing the way for the main site preparation work to begin.",
            "Yesterday, the government said that OPG \"has now completed the early works for the first SMR in the G7 on time and on budget\" and added that the site has now been transitioned into the care of the Darlington New Nuclear Project's construction partner, Aecon, to allow for main site preparation to begin. This work includes excavation, the construction of shoring walls, and land clearance for three additional units.",
            "\"We are today announcing the next phase of construction on the first small modular reactor of its kind in our country and across the G7 and part of the industrialised world,\" Lecce said during his visit to the site. \"We're building four here. And we're expanding Bruce. We're extending the life of Pickering. These are massive investments to ensure we have the energy security to build our economy.\"",
            "The new minister also marked the successful completion of trade missions to Romania and France, with \"significant deals\" worth over CAD360 million (USD261 million) including the signature of new agreements with Nuclearelectrica in Romania and Stellarex in France. Lecce and former Ontario Energy Minister Todd Smith - now the province's Minister of Education - also met with European government representatives and energy companies and hosted a Nuclear Education Roundtable to discuss workforce and talent gaps in Romania's nuclear sector and opportunities for future collaboration.",
            "\"With increasing geopolitical volatility, it is clear that countries around the world are looking for stable democratic energy partners that offer clean, reliable and affordable energy - and Ontario is once again answering that call,\" said Lecce. \"Thanks to Ontario's domestic nuclear programme, we are landing major agreements abroad that are creating value-added jobs back home in Ontario as we deliver a major nuclear refurbishment in Romania that is going to support energy security for Europe.\"",

Provided the US Department of Energy (DoE) has confidence in a project, it can guarantee up to 80% of the total debt. This security should entice more lenders and reduce the cost of the loan for the utility, while costing the DoE only for administration.",
            "US prospects for new build have been hit hard by a combination of a temporary drop in power demand on the global recession and a related drop in gas prices. Several projects have been put on hold until power demand picks back up. Utility heads now say loan guarantees are vital for the economics of new build, but none have yet been announced despite rumours about DoE shortlists.",
            "More welcome news for nuclear in yesterday's proposed US budget was a commitment to continue funding the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP), which is to be an advanced reactor with co-generation capability at Idaho National Lab. This was originally meant to actually operate in 2010, but its priority has fluctuated. NGNP is part of the 'Reactor Concepts RD&D' program, which will also begin working on small modular reactor concepts with a total budget of $195 million.",
            "All funding for the former Yucca Mountain project has now been officially ended, with the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management wound up and responsibility for meeting the goals of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 now passed back to the main Office of Nuclear Energy. The license application submitted to regulators by the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management has also been officially discontinued. The DoE noted: \"The administration has determined that developing a repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada is not a workable option... The nation needs a different solution for nuclear waste disposal.\" Yesterday a 'Blue Ribbon' commission was named to develop a new strategy and correspondingly the DoE today increased fuel cycle research by 47% to $201 million.",
            "Overall, the DoE is to undergo management changes meant to make it more 'results-oriented'. Changes are to be made across all departments as well as the office of the secretary."

On offer is access to up to $226 million, for which a range of companies have placed bids. Babcock & Wilcox's mPower reactor won the first round and was given access to $79 million in November 2012.",

However, the nameplate generating capacity of 165 MWe matches the former PBMR design rather than General Atomics' ~280 MWe GT-MHR, and General Atomics is not mentioned in the NPMC bid. General Atomics has actually submitted its own bid to the DoE based on a variation of GT-MHR known as the Energy Multiplier Module.",

Both are based on 'Triso' fuel particles where a 0.5 mm speck of uranium oxide fuel is contained in several layers of silicon and carbon and embedded in a graphite matrix. PBMR's design has these formed into tennis ball-sized pebbles that make up a large core, while GT-MHR has them in hexagonal prisms that build into a compact core block. Both designs also use helium as coolant, directly driving a turbine-generator set."

            "The USA has a moral obligation to address its nuclear waste issue, and restarting the Yucca Mountain licensing process and committing to establishing an interim storage facility for used fuel will accelerate the fulfilment of that obligation, US Energy Secretary Rick Perry this week told House and Senate appropriations subcommittees.",
            "Rick Perry (in the foreground) visited the Yucca Mountain site in March",
            "Perry addressed the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development on 20 June and the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development the following day, to present the Department of Energy's (DOE's) proposed 2018 budget. In his testimony to both committees, he said the need to address nuclear waste management was a \"moral\" obligation. \"For too many years, the prior administration has literally kicked the can down the road on nuclear waste,\" he said.",
            "The US administration's budget for fiscal 2018, which commences on 1 October, requests $28 billion for the DOE. Included in the request is $120 million to resume licensing at Yucca Mountain and to initiate a \"robust\" interim storage program, Perry told the committees. Of this, $110 million would be used to restart Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing activities for the nuclear waste repository, including funding for management, site operations and maintenance, as well as technical, scientific, legal and other support. $10 million would be used to initiate a \"robust interim storage program\" to complement the repository by developing a capability to accelerate removal of used fuel and high-level wastes currently being stored in sites in 39 states across the country. \"An interim storage capability also adds flexibility to the system that will move materials from sites across the country to its ultimate disposition,\" he said.",
            "Yucca Mountain in Nevada has since 1987 been named in the US Nuclear Waste Policy Act as the sole repository for disposal of the country's used nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive wastes. The DOE submitted a construction licence application for the project to the NRC in 2008, but the previous US administration subsequently decided to abort the project, appointing a high-level Blue Ribbon Commission to come up with alternative strategies.",
            "The budget proposal also includes $703 million for nuclear energy - $313 million less than in fiscal 2017 - to continue \"innovating new and improved ways to generate nuclear power\", Perry said. Funding will be focused on early-stage research and development that enables innovation driven by the private sector. It also includes $20 million for early-stage R&D supporting advanced small modular reactor designs, Perry said."

            "Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) has issued a request for proposals (RFP) for the design and construction of a CAD370 million (USD283 million) laboratory research complex that will be the largest single capital investment in the CAD1.2 billion revitalisation of its Chalk River site.",
            "The ANMRC is central to CNL's vision for Chalk River (Image: CNL)",
            "The Advanced Nuclear Materials Research Centre (ANMRC) will consolidate key capabilities from a number of ageing facilities that are scheduled for decommissioning and will provide services critical to the life extension and long-term reliability of existing reactors, CNL said. It will include new shielded facilities for post-irradiation examination of small modular reactor (SMR) and next-generation nuclear fuels; glovebox facilities to support the development of advanced fuel fabrication concepts; and materials storage bays that will simplify the on-site transportation of radioactive materials, improving work efficiency at the Ontario campus.",
            "With construction scheduled to start in 2019, the ANMRC will be one of the largest active research facilities ever to be constructed in Canada and, according to CNL president and CEO Mark Lesinski, will be at the centre of the transformation of Chalk River.",
            "\"Once complete, the facility will serve as a state-of-the-art laboratory complex that will allow us to grow our research programmes, penetrate new international markets and add capabilities to better meet the needs of our federal, academic and commercial customers,\" he said.",
            "Chalk River Laboratories is home to the National Research Universal reactor, which is due to close down later this month after 60 years of operations. CNL in April 2017 unveiled a ten-year strategy for the site after the closure of the reactor, consolidating and modernising it to support federal and industrial nuclear research needs.",
            "CNL has a long-term term vision of Chalk River as a hub for SMRs, and plans to site a prototype or demonstration SMR at the site by 2026. The organisation's 2017 request for expressions of interest in SMRs received 80 responses, including 19 expressions of interest in building a prototype or demonstration reactor at a CNL site.",
            "CNL in February launched the construction of three new 'enabling' facilities at the site: a new logistics complex, business hub and manufacturing and maintenance support facility, together representing an investment of more than CAD100 million. It has also opened a new CAD-55 million hydrogen laboratory complex and a CAD-100 million materials research laboratory, and is in the final stages of commissioning a new CAD40 million tritium laboratory. Over CAD90 million is also being invested in on-site infrastructure improvements."

            "Terrestrial Energy USA is an affiliate of Terrestrial Energy Inc and is developing the IMSR for deployment in the US market. Molten salt reactors use fuel dissolved in a molten fluoride or chloride salt which functions as both the reactor's fuel and its coolant, meaning that such a reactor could not suffer from a loss of coolant leading to a meltdown. Terrestrial's IMSR integrates the primary reactor components, including the graphite moderator, into a sealed and replaceable reactor core. The reactor can produce 400 MWt (190 MWe) of energy, and is designed as a modular reactor for factory fabrication.",
            "Terrestrial says the IMSR can be brought to market in the 2020s. The company last year began a feasibility study to site a commercial IMSR at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories' Chalk River site, and the reactor design has already completed the first phase of the Canadian Nuclear Regulatory Commission's vendor design review. It announced in January that it plans to submit an application for design certification or for a construction permit to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission by October 2019.",
            "Terrestrial Energy USA CEO Simon Irish said the agreement with Energy Northwest was a positive step towards the deployment of the IMSR.",
            "\"Energy Northwest's considerable expertise in the region will contribute substantially to the commercial success of an IMSR power plant under consideration at the INL site,\" he said.",
            "Energy Northwest is a not-for-profit joint operating agency comprising 27 public power member utilities from across Washington state. The agency develops, owns and operates a diverse mix of electricity generating resources, including the Columbia nuclear power plant, and says it continually explores new generation projects to meet its members' needs.",
            "\"As a major producer of emission-free power, Energy Northwest is excited to examine how this innovative reactor can meet regional energy demand through efficient and clean energy generation,\" said Mark Reddemann, Energy Northwest CEO. \"Terrestrial Energy's IMSR has transformative potential in electric power and industrial heat markets,\" he added.",
            "Energy Northwest in 2013 signed teaming agreements with NuScale Power and Utah Associated Municiapl Power Systems, as part of the Western Initiative for Nuclear collaboration studying the demonstration and deployment of NuScale small modular reactor power plants. A preferred site for the first NuScale SMR, also at Idaho National Laboratory, was identified in 2016 with an initial plant projected to be operational by 2024."

A regulatory engagement plan will help reactor developers' early interactions with NRC staff and can reduce regulatory uncertainty and add predictability to licensing advanced technologies, the NEI said.",
            "NuScale's SMR, which would be housed inside steel containment vessels and submerged in a large pool of water below ground level in the reactor building, is being reviewed by the NRC (Image: NuScale)",
            "The US nuclear industry is currently enjoying significant interest in advanced nuclear technology development, with \"dozens of organisations\" - from innovative venture capital startups and established nuclear companies to government research establishments - currently working on innovative reactor designs, the NEI said.",
            "Advanced reactor designs offer the potential for lower construction and operating costs, rapid modular manufacture and deployment, enhanced safety and operational efficiency, and more efficient use of fuel resources. Many designs promise more versatile applications than existing commercial nuclear power plants, such as greater ability to adjust their output to suit an electric grid supplied by intermittent wind and solar power, or the option of providing high-quality process heat for applications ranging from industrial use to large-scale desalination and hydrogen production.",
            "The designs and operating characteristics of such reactors are radically different from the large light water-cooled reactors currently in commercial use in the US, for example using gaseous, molten metal or molten salt coolants. As a result, both the industry and the NRC are preparing for necessarily different licensing and regulatory processes, the NEI said yesterday.",
            "One advanced reactor concept - NuScale Power's 50 MWe small modular reactor (SMR) - is currently undergoing US regulatory review. \"Even based as it is on proven light water reactor (LWR) technology, pre-application interactions with the NRC were not as effective as desired, taking more than eight years and costing USD12 million in regulatory fees,\" the NEI noted. The developers of several other advanced non-LWRs are involved in pre-application interactions with the regulator.",

            "Used high-enriched uranium fuel from EBR-II's operations are currently refined and downblended at INL's Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC) using an electrorefiner. The HALEU thus produced - which contains 5-20% of fissile uranium-235 - is currently stored at INL.",
            "The low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel used in today's nuclear power plants typically contains less than 5% of fissile uranium-235, but many of the advanced reactor designs currently under development will require HALEU fuel. There are at present no commercial facilities in the US that are immediately capable of producing HALEU.",
            "DOE proposes expanding capabilities at MCF and at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center to convert metallic HALEU into about 10 tonnes of reactor fuel for research and development purposes. This would be used to support near-term research, development and demonstration needs of private-sector developers and government agencies, including advanced reactor developers. Most of the HALEU would come from the processing and treatment of used fuel from EBR-II, as well as other small quantities of the material that are stored at INL.",

            "The SMR-160 application is under review by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and is in Phase 1 of the three-phase evaluation cycle. State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine, the nuclear regulatory authority in Ukraine, is expected to coordinate its regulatory assessment of SMR-160 under a collaborative arrangement with its Canadian counterpart.",
            "Energoatom President Yury Nedashkovsky announced plans to establish a consortium with Holtec and Ukraine's national nuclear consultant, State Scientific and Technical Centre for Nuclear and Radiation Safety (SSTC-NRS), to explore the environmental and technical feasibility of qualifying a 'generic' SMR-160 system that can be built and operated at any candidate site in the country \"with absolute assurance of public health and safety\", Holtec said on 19 February. A formal announcement of the adoption of the terms of engagement for the consortium is expected shortly.",

            "However, the working group said there is room for improvement in the existing permit system. At the initial stage of the process, matters should be dealt with at a general level and detailed processing should take place at a later stage of the process, it recommended. It needs to be easier to anticipate the acceptability of the solutions, for example by means of prior approvals, and overlapping processes should be reduced. And the licence for decommissioning of a nuclear facility should be reformed, it said.",

            "The US Department of Energy (DOE) is teaming up with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) and providing USD5.8 million in funding for a project to demonstrate how three construction technologies from other industries can be applied to advanced reactor designs, to improve the economics of bringing advanced reactors to market. The Advanced Construction Technology (ACT) Initiative aims to reduce cost overruns and schedule slippages.",
            "The three technologies have been used successfully in other industries but have not yet been tested within the context of nuclear energy, the DOE said. Together, they could reduce the cost of new nuclear builds by more than 10%. They are:",

Each unit is projected to cost about GBP50 million (USD68 million).",
            "The reactor's high-temperature output of 710°C means it is ideally suited to provide a sustainable source of process heat for difficult-to-decarbonise industrial processes, the company says. Its cogeneration capabilities mean it can provide a locally embedded and reliable source of heat and power, for example at mining sites and in off-grid remote communities. \"Sizeable\" prospective markets have been identified in the UK and in Canada.",

            ", providing a market overview of opportunities for the deployment of the reactor in Canada, its benefits and opportunities, has been shared by the companies. The document also considers the key federal, provincial, and territorial policy and regulatory enablers needed for its deployment.",
            "The eVinci micro-reactor is described in the report as a \"small battery\" for decentralised generation markets and for micro grids, such as remote communities, remote industrial mines and critical infrastructure. The nominal 5 MWe heat pipe reactor, which has a heat capability of 14 MWt, features a design that Westinghouse says provides competitive and resilient power as well as superior reliability with minimal maintenance. It is small enough to allow for standard transportation methods, making it perfectly suited for remote locations and rapid, on-site deployment. These features, the company says, make it a viable option for mines and remote and off-grid communities.",
            "A single eVinci micro-reactor is expected to be between 14% and 44% more economic than a diesel generator, depending upon the price of diesel fuel and the price for carbon, and in mining scenarios, such a unit - with diesel back-up - could reduce carbon emissions by about 90%, the report notes in its key takeaways.",
            "Successful deployment would depend on achieving a regulatory model that considers the unit's size and has a predictable outcome, to reduce risk to operations at the host site, it finds. Westinghouse applied in February 2018 to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission for a pre-licensing vendor design review of the eVinci. The report estimates that the first commercial unit in Canada \"should be licensed within three years,\" but adds that broad public and host community acceptance will be essential to reactor deployment.",
            "The study concludes that the eVinci micro-reactor represents a \"feasible alternative\" to diesel generation at mines and in remote communities, where it can provide opportunities to reduce or eliminate dependence on expensive diesel generation with a more economic option that also reduces emissions. The reduced cost electricity and heating provided by the reactor can also provide opportunities for economic growth.",
            "\"The strong partnership between Bruce Power and Westinghouse has set the stage for the deployment of a leading eVinci micro-reactor programme within Canada, to provide a reliable source of carbon-free energy in grid-edge and off-grid communities,\" it says. \"These efforts support actions by the federal and provincial governments to study applications for nuclear technology to reach their goal of a net-zero Canada by 2050.\"",

            "The welded circular steel sections (Image: Sheffield Forgemasters)",
            "The weld, equivalent to approximately 10 metres of length, was completed in 140 minutes. The company said such a weld would normally take months and include various stages of non-destructive testing as well as heat treatment.",
            "Professor Jesus Talamantes-Silva, research, design and technology director, said: \"This is the most critical milestone in our project to industrialise EBW and to eliminate the requirement for large vacuum chambers typically used in this technology, we have pioneered the use of local vacuum EBW alongside our project partners, Cambridge Vacuum Engineering (CVE).",
            "\"This follows a body of work started in 2015 with support from Innovate UK to establish the basic science for local vacuum EBW, which was successful, producing welds with very favourable mechanical properties.\"",
            "The EBW process uses local vacuum and a high-power electron gun which penetrates the vessel material with an electron beam, to melt and fuse the two components together in one go, rather than building up multiple layers of weld filler wire.",
            "An industry steering committee including the Ministry of Defence, Rolls-Royce submarines and SMR divisions, the UK Atomic Energy Authority and Cavendish Nuclear, was formed to ensure awareness of EBW technology within the context of the UK’s civil nuclear power plans. Engagement from the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the Environment Agency (EA) was also instigated by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).",
            "Senior Development Engineer and Project Lead Michael Blackmore said: \"We completed the weld and carried out the factory acceptance testing of the machine tool, a process that verifies that the equipment is built and operating in accordance with design specifications at CVE's site in Cambridge.",
            "\"We are due to start building an X-Ray enclosure to house the EBW equipment, and it will be ready during Q2 2022. We are also planning to fully demonstrate the welding capabilities by fabricating a full-scale nuclear pressure vessel which will consist of five main components, four shells and a nuclear head, to ensure a reliable and repetitive process.\"",

            "Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has been identified as the preferred site for the construction and operation of the sodium-cooled fast neutron reactor in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) released by the US Department of Energy (DOE).",
            "How the VTR could look (Image: INL)",
            "The Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) will be used to provide a source of fast neutrons for testing and evaluating nuclear fuels, materials, sensors, and instrumentation to support the development of advanced reactor technologies. Such facilities are currently available in only a few locations worldwide, and the USA has not operated one in more than 20 years.",
            "\"VTR will provide US researchers from industry, academia, and our national laboratories with a critical tool for developing transformational technologies that will expand nuclear energy's contribution to abundant, carbon-free energy,\" Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Kathryn Huff said. \"VTR's contribution to the fight against climate change begins with our commitment to designing, constructing, and operating the VTR in a way that protects the environment and nearby communities.\"",
            "The US Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which became law in September 2018, directed the DOE to develop a reactor-based fast neutron source for the testing of advanced reactor fuels and materials, and to execute a programme for enhancing the capability to develop new reactor technologies through high-performance computer modelling and simulation techniques. The VTR project was launched in 2019 by then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry. A draft EIS was released in December 2020, which was opened to public comments in the first months of 2021.",
            "The VTR will be a 300 MW (thermal) pool-type, sodium-cooled reactor using a uranium-plutonium-zirconium metal fuel based on GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's PRISM small modular reactor design.",
            "The FEIS analyses and evaluates the potential impacts of the alternative options of INL and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), including constructing and operating the reactor, post-irradiation examination experimental of specimens in hot cell facilities, and the conditioning and storage of used fuel pending its shipment for interim storage or permanent disposal. It also evaluates production of fuel for the reactor at INL and/or DOE's Savannah River site, and a so-called no-action alternative of not going ahead with the construction and operation of the VTR.",
            "DOE's preferred alternative is to build and operate the VTR at INL, where existing facilities within the adjacent Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC) would be modified and used for post-irradiation examination of test assemblies and treatment of used nuclear fuel. Treated used fuel would be temporarily stored at a new VTR spent fuel pad at MFC. The FEIS finds that, although both the INL and ORNL options would generally have small environmental consequences, overall these would be smaller at the INL site.",
            "DOE has not yet identified a preferred option for the location of fuel production services for the VTR, but could choose to use either INL, Savannah River, or a combination of both sites to for feedstock preparation and fuel fabrication. Existing facilities would be modified or adapted to provide the necessary capabilities at both locations. Implementing fuel production at either INL and Savannah River would generally have small environmental consequences, the FEIS says. The source of the plutonium - US weapon-grade plutonium, foreign reactor-grade plutonium, or some other material - to be used is an issue that must be resolved, it says, as the processes to be deployed will depend on the characteristics of the plutonium feedstock selected.",
            "Issuance of the VTR FEIS means that DOE can now proceed with making a final decision on the project. It expects to issue a formal Record of Decision later this year.",

All four are taking proactive steps to harness and produce technology at their facilities to drive down their carbon emissions, DOE said, as well as conducting research that will help bring forward clean energy solutions for the nation. They also reflect different geographic and climate regions that each face unique energy challenges.",
            "\"Transitioning to a net-zero future will require slashing carbon pollution across all industries - from shipping to manufacturing to construction, and even the operation of our national laboratories,\" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said. \"DOE's National Labs are leading by example to address some of the most energy-intensive, hardest-to-decarbonise federal facilities to reduce our nation's carbon footprint - mitigating the disastrous impacts of climate change, lowering energy costs, and supporting the growing clean energy workforce.\"",
            "The national laboratories are some of the US federal government's most complex energy users and have demand and resilience requirements far exceeding those of a standard facility, DOE said. The pilot initiative will demonstrate that the labs' heavy industrial facilities, energy-intensive data centres, reactors, and other unique infrastructure that demands large amounts of continuous power can be powered using clean energy. Additional funding is expected to be made available next year to all 17 national labs.",
            "\"INL is energy-intense and complex, with approximately 900 square miles of facilities, 600 vehicles, 320 buildings, and 5300 employees,\" INL Director John Wagner said. \"Achieving net-zero by 2031 will be an enormous challenge that requires tremendous innovation, changes to how we conduct operations, and collaboration with local, state, and national partners. By proving it can be accomplished, we will be able to inspire and help others.\"",
            "INL plans to use nuclear innovations such as advanced reactor technologies - including micro and small modular reactors - to demonstrate a microgrid capable of powering its site when integrated with other renewable forms of energy such as solar, wind and geothermal. It also plans to reduce emissions from its operations by decarbonising its bus and vehicle fleet. It promised an \"integrated approach that centres net-zero as a core component of INL's mission to discover, demonstrate and secure innovative nuclear clean energy solutions.\"",

It also calls for the construction of units 3 and 4 at the Shin Hanul nuclear power plant to resume after design work was suspended in 2017 due to uncertainties about government policy on the construction of new reactors.",

            "President Yoon Suk-yeol, who took office in May, has vowed to reverse former President Moon Jae-in's policy of phasing out nuclear power, a policy which was brought in after he assumed office in 2017, and followed the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan.",
            "During a cabinet meeting today, presided by President Yoon, a new energy policy was announced.",
            "\"Amid the global push for carbon neutrality and the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and global energy supply chain uncertainties, energy security and attaining carbon neutrality goals are now more critical than ever,\" the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) said in a statement. \"In response to these changes, it is imperative that new energy policy goals and directions are set so as to better accomplish carbon neutral government projects and the expansion of nuclear power.\"",
            "It said in order for a \"feasible and reasonable\" energy mix to be reestablished, construction of Shin Hanul 3 and 4 is to resume \"with the goal of expanding the nuclear energy ratio to a minimum of 30% by 2030\". The ministry added: \"This 30% hinges on the premise that nuclear plants still under construction will achieve normal operation, and that those currently in operation will achieve continued operation.\"",
            "Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power announced in May 2017 that it had instructed Kepco Engineering & Construction - which signed a design contract in March 2016 - to suspend work for the two planned APR1400 units at Shin Hanul 3 and 4. This work would be suspended, the state-owned utility said, until the government policy on the construction of new nuclear power plants is confirmed. However, work towards licensing the new units was to continue.",
            "The new policy also aims to strengthen exports of new energy industries and \"capitalise on them as growth engines\". It sets the goal of exporting 10 nuclear power plants by 2030, as well as the development of a Korean small modular reactor design. The government said the policy aims to \"reinvigorate the nuclear energy ecosystem through early project procurement\".",
            "Under the policy, the government says renewable energy supply goals must be \"reestablished in consideration of rational and realistic supply conditions\". It says the specific ratio of different sources of power, such as solar and offshore wind, must be determined for \"optimal outcome\".",
            "South Korea's phase-out of coal power must be done in a \"rational manner\", it says, \"factoring in the supply-demand situation and system status\". The use of zero-carbon power sources \"should take technological circumstances into account\".",
            "\"The new regime's energy policies and directions announced as above are to replace the previous government's nuclear phase-out plan, and the 30% ratio goal officialises the policy of increasing nuclear power utilisation in view of carbon neutral and energy security,\" MOTIE said.",
            "\"Smooth implementation of the aforementioned new energy policies will help reduce reliance on fossil fuel imports from 81.8% (2021) to 60% (2030). Furthermore, 100,000 new jobs are expected to be created by 2030 through the nurturing of new energy industries and exports.\"",

            "Fermi Energia said its international partners and shareholders helped prepare the detailed call for tenders. It said in the selection of technology, the criteria are technological maturity, the establishment of a reference plant, economic competitiveness and the participation of Estonian companies in the supply chain. A project development and preliminary works contract will be signed with the winning bidder.",
            "\"We started selecting the technology already in 2019, at that moment mapping all the companies developing new nuclear technologies, of which there were several dozen in the world at that time,\" said Fermi Energia CEO Kalev Kallemets. \"Some of them have turned out to be more successful, and from the successful ones, in turn, we have to choose the most suitable for Estonian conditions and the electricity system, taking into account the final price of the produced electricity for the consumer.",
            "\"All three small reactor manufacturers participating in the bid have initiated formal construction permit procedures with the regulator in major countries, and it is believed that the first reactors of their kind to be built will produce electricity at the end of the decade. It is justified to choose the best reactor technology of the new generation, which has already proven itself, to be built in Estonia.\"",
            "According to Fermi Energia, the costs of building a small reactor with standardised, factory-produced components are significantly lower than in the case of large nuclear plants built so far, and the short construction time also helps to reduce the risk of delays and related costs.",
            "\"Compared to long-term fixed-price contracts offered to private and industrial consumers on the Baltic market, the electricity produced by a small reactor is many times more affordable, and we want to offer it to consumers with whom we have signed fixed-price electricity supply cooperation contracts,\" Kallemets added.",
            "\"Both NuScale and GE Hitachi are companies with financial support from the United States government, the British government has invested GBP210 million in the development of Rolls-Royce's small modular reactor,\" said Marti Jeltsov, Chief Technology Officer of Fermi Energia. \"All three companies have achieved design maturity over the past few years, which provides significant certainty to the feasibility of the projects. The arrival of the new generation of small reactors on the market also gives Fermi Energia the opportunity to move ahead with the technology selection at a faster pace than planned.\"",

            "Moltex Energy Limited subsidiary MoltexFLEX has launched its FLEX molten salt reactor that, through flexible operation and the use of thermal storage technology, can support intermittent renewable energy through its rapid responsiveness to changes in demand.",
            "A FLEX reactor plant (Image: MoltexFLEX)",
            "\"This advanced nuclear technology has the flexibility of gas-fired power stations, but it generates electricity at a lower cost, and without carbon emissions,\" said Warrington, UK-based MoltexFLEX.",
            "As the reactor has no moving parts, MoltexFLEX said the FLEX reactor is simple in both design and operation. The reactor can respond to changes in energy demand - automatically entering an idle state or returning rapidly to full power - making it an ideal complement to wind and solar power. Conventional reactors, it said, are not suited to rapidly changing their output.",
            "According to MoltexFLEX, the cost of electricity generated by the FLEX reactor is comparable to that of wind, at just GBP40 (USD44) per MWh. This is achieved through a unique, patented system which uses two molten salts: one acting as a fuel, whilst the other circulates as a coolant. This allows the heat from the reactor to be extracted through natural convection, without the need for pumps.",
            "The FLEX reactor is small and modular, allowing components to be factory-produced and readily transportable, reducing on-site work, increasing speed of construction, and minimising overall costs. It is passively safe, so does not require engineered, redundant, active safety systems.",
            "A cutaway of the FLEX reactor (Image: MoltexFLEX)",
            "Once online, the FLEX reactor can be operated with the same skills and equipment used in a fossil fuel plant. The reactor has no moving parts and is fuelled for 20 years at a time, meaning that there is very little operator input and very low ongoing costs.",
            "Each reactor delivers 40 MW of thermal energy at 700°C. This heat is stored in MoltexFLEX's GridReserve thermal storage tanks, so that the power plant can deliver three times the power when renewables alone cannot meet the market need for electricity.",
            "During longer periods of high renewable generation, the FLEX reactor can simply move passively into idle mode - producing just enough heat to keep the reactor at operating temperature.",
            "MoltexFLEX estimates it would take just 24 months to build a 500 MW power plant. The company plans to have its first reactor operational by 2029.",
            "\"We recognised the need for an energy supply that can support renewables when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow,\" said MoltexFLEX CEO David Landon. \"In the FLEX reactor, we have a solution for consumers and countries alike.",
            "\"The FLEX reactor provides the safety net of affordable domestic energy, but is versatile enough for applications ranging from decarbonising heavy industry to powering cargo ships.\"",
            "The FLEX reactor is the thermal neutron (moderated) version of Moltex Energy's stable salt reactor technology. That technology is shared with MoltexFLEX's sister company, Moltex Energy Canada Inc, which is developing the fast neutron version of the stable salt reactor.",
            "In May 2021, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission completed the first phase of the pre-licensing vendor design review for Moltex Energy's 300 MWe Stable Salt Reactor - Wasteburner (SSR-W 300) small modular reactor.

Operator PG&E earlier this month formally asked the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to resume work on relicensing the plants to enable them to continue operating until 2030.",
            "\"This is a critical step toward ensuring that our domestic nuclear fleet will continue providing reliable and affordable power to Americans as the nation's largest source of clean electricity,\" US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said. \"Nuclear energy will help us meet President Biden's climate goals, and with these historic investments in clean energy, we can protect these facilities and the communities they serve.\"",
            "The conditional award of credits creates a path forward for Diablo Canyon - which produces around 16 GWh of electricity annually, about 15% of California's clean energy - to stay open, DOE said, as well as saving 1,500 clean energy jobs.",
            "DOE's announcement came after Holtec International announced that its bid for funding to reopen the Palisades plant in Michigan had been unsuccessful. The plant closed down in May after more than 50 years in operation.",

As a result, X-energy has a prospective customer pipeline of approximately 30 potential unique customers, including Dow Inc and Ontario Power Generation Inc, for both power generation and industrial use applications. We believe the identified end-markets represent a potential USD500 billon revenue opportunity for plants constructed by 2040, growing to an approximately USD1 trillion dollar revenue opportunity for plants constructed by 2050.\"",

            "The NuScale Power Module, on which the company's VOYGR plants are based, is a pressurised water reactor incorporating all the components for steam generation and heat exchange. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued a Final Safety Evaluation Report (FSER) for the design in September 2020, approving it for use in the USA - the only SMR design to date to receive such approval. Later that year, after further studies supported by increased analysis and test data, NuScale concluded that the technology could generate 25% more power per module, for a total of 77 MWe per module (gross). It therefore decided to seek approval of a six-module design, instead of the 12-module configuration that was in the previously approved design.",
            "The Portland, Oregon-headquartered company said it completed the submission of its Standard Design Approval (SDA) application for the updated design - based on the six-module VOYGR-6 plant configuration, powered by the 77 MWe module - on 1 January. The design features the same fundamental safety case and passive safety features approved by the NRC in 2020, the company said.",
            "NuScale President and CEO John Hopkins described the submission of the SDA application as \"another critical regulatory milestone\" for the company. \"Customers already appreciate that our SMR is unmatched in reliability and safety. Today's announcement solidifies our technological superiority and does so within our previously stated commercialisation timeline,\" he added.",
            "NuScale said it has submitted all parts of the application to the NRC including the entire Final Safety Analysis Report and all technical reports, which are incorporated by reference into the FSAR. Three additional Licensing Topical Reports are expected to be submitted by NuScale in the coming days. The NRC's previous approval \"has set the stage for an efficient and effective review of the second SDA application\", the company said.",

            "Meanwhile, the signing of a FEED contract by RoPower and NuScale on 28 December has been described by the companies as a significant step towards the deployment of a VOYGR plant in Romania. RoPower, a joint venture of Nova Power & Gas and Nuclearelectrica, is working on a project to repower a former coal plant at Doicești with a VOYGR-6 plant supplied by NuScale.",
            "The FEED contract follows a June 2022 memorandum of understanding between NuScale and state-owned nuclear power corporation Nuclearelectrica to begin conducting engineering studies, technical reviews, and licensing and permitting activities for the project.",
            "The first phase of FEED work will define the major site and specific inputs for a VOYGR-6 SMR power plant at Doicești. The eight-month project will include the issuance of subcontracts to perform the environmental impact assessment and subsurface geotechnical investigation, the evaluation of site and site-specific requirements for NuScale's standard plant design, and the development of a project-specific cost estimate.",
            "\"NuScale's commencement of Phase 1 Front-End Engineering and Design work in partnership with Nuclearelectrica/RoPower keeps Romania on the path toward becoming the first country in Europe to benefit from safe, reliable and carbon-free small modular reactor technology,” Hopkins said.",

            "The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) has spun off two nuclear start-ups - Hexana and Stellaria - for the development of small modular reactors (SMRs).",
            "The Hexana team: Paul Gauthé , Jean-Baptiste Droin and Sylvain Nizou (Image: CEA / L Godart)",
            "Hexana aims to develop an SMR featuring a sodium-cooled fast neutron reactor, integrated with a high temperature storage device. A plant would comprise two of these reactors (400 MWt each) supplying a heat storage device. An adjoining conversion system will allow it to produce electricity on demand and in a flexible manner to compete with gas-fired power plants, but also to supply heat directly to nearby energy-intensive industries.",
            "CEA said fast neutron and sodium-cooled reactors are of \"major interest in the management of nuclear materials: they operate without natural or enriched uranium but with depleted uranium combined with plutonium from reprocessed fuel from the French nuclear fleet (MOX)\".",
            "It added: \"These reactors will thus contribute to energy sovereignty and to the reduction of the volumes of high-level nuclear waste in a logic of closing the nuclear fuel cycle.\"",
            "Meanwhile, Stellaria aims to develop an energy system based on a chloride molten salt reactor (MSR).",
            "The Stellaria team: Guillaume Campioni, Lucas Tardieu and Nicolas Breyton (Image: CEA / L Godart)",
            "MSRs use molten fluoride salts as primary coolant, at low pressure. They may operate with epithermal or fast neutron spectrums, and with a variety of fuels. Much of the interest today in reviving the MSR concept relates to using thorium (to breed fissile uranium-233), where an initial source of fissile material such as plutonium-239 needs to be provided. There are a number of different MSR design concepts, and a number of interesting challenges in the commercialisation of many, especially with thorium.",
            "The salts concerned as primary coolant, mostly lithium-beryllium fluoride and lithium fluoride, remain liquid without pressurisation from about 500°C up to about 1400°C, in marked contrast to a pressurised water reactor which operates at about 315°C under 150 atmospheres pressure.",
            "The main MSR concept is to have the fuel dissolved in the coolant as fuel salt, and ultimately to reprocess that online. Thorium, uranium, and plutonium all form suitable fluoride salts that readily dissolve in the LiF-BeF2 (FLiBe) mixture, and thorium and uranium can be easily separated from one another in fluoride form. Batch reprocessing is likely in the short term, and fuel life is quoted at 4-7 years, with high burn-up.",
            "The reactor proposed by Stellaria will be very compact - measuring 4 cubic metres - and, like Hexana, will be able to use a diversified range of nuclear fuels (uranium, plutonium, MOX, minor actinides, even thorium), \"thus fitting perfectly into the French strategy of closing the cycle\". The reactor will produce 250 MWt.",
            "The CEA intends to find partners beyond the nuclear sector for these two start-ups, which will be able to apply for the France 2030 call for \"innovative nuclear reactors\" projects: a programme endowed with EUR500 million (USD534 million) which will part of the government's desire to close the nuclear fuel cycle,",
            "In February 2022, President Emmanuel Macron announced that the time was right for a nuclear renaissance in France, saying the operation of all existing reactors should be extended without compromising safety and unveiled a proposed programme for six new EPR2 reactors, with an option for a further eight EPR2 reactors to follow.",
            "In addition, Macron said EUR1.0 billion will be made available through the France 2030 re-industrialisation plan for France's Nuward small modular reactor project and \"innovative reactors to close the fuel cycle and produce less waste\". He said he had set \"an ambitious goal\" to construct a first prototype in France by 2030.",

            "Shapps (left) and Lee signing the joint statement (Image: BEIS)",
            "The statement was signed in Seoul on 10 April by British Energy Security Secretary Grant Shapps and South Korean Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Lee Chang-yang.",
            "On nuclear energy, the statement aims \"on advancing civil nuclear power generation, cementing a partnership spanning over three decades, covering issues including safety standards and regulation, all agreeing the crucial role of nuclear in creating secure, affordable and clean energy\", the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said.",
            "It said the joint statement of cooperation on energy transition, including civil nuclear energy, focuses on: accelerating plans for civil nuclear - with the UK and South Korea in agreement that nuclear energy has an essential role to play in creating secure and affordable energy; agreement on collaborating to promote the highest standards of nuclear safety, regulation, security, safeguards and non-proliferation – setting a global standard; confirmation of plans to build robust and resilient nuclear supply chains and to share experiences in developing the latest advanced civil nuclear technologies – including small modular reactors; and reaffirming a shared commitment to accelerate the just transition away from unabated coal power and actively collaborate on expanding renewable energy technologies.",
            "\"Korea is making a broad range of policy efforts aimed at energy transition in shifting towards carbon neutrality on the basis of stable power supply,\" Lee said. He added that Korea \"plans to expand renewable energy to appropriate and attainable levels while utilising nuclear energy, a zero-carbon power source, on the premise of securing stability.\"",
            "Lee said \"South Korea's strengths lie in design, construction and main equipment production, while the UK's lie in decommissioning and nuclear fuel\", adding that \"mutually beneficial cooperation is possible\".",
            "\"I want the Republic of Korea to work ever closer with us in the UK, making the most of world-leading British expertise to move further and faster towards greater use of renewables, of opportunities in the UK to invest, and to redouble our efforts against Putin’s weaponising of our global energy sources,\" Shapps said.",
            "Last month, Shapps launched the Powering Up Britain policy paper, which sets out \"ambitious plans to scale up affordable, clean, homegrown power and build thriving green industries in Britain ... boosting the country's energy security and independence and reducing household bills for the long-term and maintaining a world-leading position in achieving net-zero\". On nuclear, the government has launched Great British Nuclear, which will be responsible for driving the delivery of new nuclear projects, with the aim of increasing the share of nuclear in the UK's electricity mix from the current 15% to 25% by 2050.",
            "In July last year, the South Korean government laid out a new energy policy which aims to maintain nuclear's share of the country's energy mix at a minimum of 30% by 2030. It also called for the construction of units 3 and 4 at the Shin Hanul nuclear power plant to resume. The new policy also aimed to strengthen exports of new energy industries and \"capitalise on them as growth engines\". It sets the goal of exporting 10 nuclear power plants by 2030, as well as the development of a Korean small modular reactor design.",

Singh also included Gorakhpur units 1 and 2 - both 700 MWe PHWRs - as \"under construction\", although there has not yet been any announcement that concrete pouring for the base mat of the reactor building - used by the International Atomic Energy Agency as the benchmark for the start of construction - has taken place.",
            "According to the Press Trust of India, Singh said on 9 April that nuclear is \"likely\" to account for nearly 9% of India's electricity by 2047, thanks to the approval by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the construction of reactors in fleet mode. He also credited Modi with a decision to allow nuclear installations to be developed under joint ventures with public sector undertakings (PSUs). India's Atomic Energy Act was amended in 2015 to enable the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd to form joint venture companies with other Indian PSUs to help the state-owned company to secure funding for new projects.",

            "MoltexFLEX says a reevaluation of certain aspects of its FLEX molten salt reactor design has \"yielded a more robust scientific and engineering foundation\" for the reactor. A refinement of the reactor design has delivered a 50% boost in power output, while maintaining previous targets for overnight capital cost and cost per MWh.",
            "A cutaway of the FLEX reactor design (Image: MoltexFLEX)",
            "Warrington, UK-headquartered MoltexFLEX - a subsidiary of Moltex Energy Limited - is developing the FLEX reactor – the thermal neutron (moderated) version of Moltex Energy's stable salt reactor technology. The reactor is small and modular, allowing components to be factory-produced and readily transportable, reducing on-site work, increasing speed of construction, and minimising overall costs. It is passively safe, so does not require engineered, redundant, active safety systems. The FLEX reactor has no moving parts and the plan was for it to be fuelled for 15 years at a time, meaning that there is very little operator input and very low ongoing costs. Each reactor was initially expected to deliver 40 MW of thermal energy at 700°C. According to MoltexFLEX, the cost of electricity generated by the FLEX reactor was likely to be GBP40 (USD50) per MWh. MoltexFLEX plans to have its first reactor operational by 2029.",
            "Following a reevaluation of the design, MoltexFLEX says FLEX's power output has increased from 40 MWth/16 MWe as originally envisaged to 60 MWth/24 MWe, made possible by optimisation of the core design and the fuel pin material.",
            "The refuelling schedule has also been adjusted to account for the fact that the FLEX reactor will now use 5% low-enriched uranium (LEU) instead of 6% LEU. MoltexFLEX said this change \"facilitates global deployment of the FLEX reactor by leveraging established security and non-proliferation measures and the existing fuel supply chain\". It says that the refuelling will now be every 5 years, reducing the amount of enriched uranium needing to be purchased when the reactor is commissioned, helping to lessen the impact of \"doubled enrichment costs and rapidly increasing interest rates making capital much more expensive\".",
            "The refinement of the design has also maintained the predicted overnight capital cost of an nth-of-a-kind reactor at approximately GBP2000/kW, and the levelised cost of electricity of a baseload electricity generating plant at less than GBP30/MWh.",
            "MoltexFLEX said that while the underlying technology remains essentially unchanged, these design evolutions represent significant improvements. \"The work provides more certainty about the company's ability to deliver on its cost targets, reinforces the underpinning science, and sets MoltexFLEX on the road toward delivering its prototype FLEX reactor around the turn of the decade,\" it said.",
            "\"We have firmly established the core aspects of the FLEX concept as we ramp up engineering design,\" said MoltexFLEX Head of Engineering Chris Hankinson. \"More work will be undertaken over the coming months to further refine and finally freeze the design, and this will then be taken forward to create our first-of-a-kind reactor.\"",
            "\"The science and engineering of the FLEX reactor has moved on apace,\" said MoltexFLEX CEO David Landon. \"The work we have completed further boosts our confidence in the design and economics of the FLEX reactor, and our ability to deliver a first reactor ready for global roll-out through the 2030s.\"",

            "An International Atomic Energy Agency  expert mission has concluded that reports compiled by the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission will provide a good basis for a feasibility study into the country's use of small modular reactors for electricity generation and seawater desalination.",
            "Members of the IAEA expert mission team and counterparts from Jordan at the IAEA in Vienna in August 2023 (Image: IAEA)",
            "Jordan is considering using a small modular reactor (SMR) to provide the electricity to operate a reverse osmosis desalination plant, as well as to pump an estimated 300 million cubic metres of drinking water each year from the Red Sea coast to the capital Amman, about 400 kilometres away and 700 metres above sea level.",
            "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) expert review mission, held at its Vienna headquarters in August 2023, comprised 18 IAEA and three external experts. It evaluated whether reports submitted by Jordan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) include all the necessary information to support the decision-making for deploying an SMR for power generation and desalination. Areas covered by the review included nuclear power technology and safety, siting and licensing, nuclear desalination, nuclear law and stakeholder engagement, among others.",
            "The mission found Jordan's reports provide a good basis for a feasibility study and also suggested areas where the work could be expanded or improved. These included conducting a study on the selection of the nuclear unit size while taking into account the need to strengthen electrical connections to the nodal points of the grid and to neighbouring countries; and exploring potential alternative fuel suppliers.",
            "\"This endeavour exemplified an agency-wide collaborative effort that addressed all aspects of the feasibility study, providing essential guidance on IAEA services that Jordan could benefit from in enhancing the assessment and progress of our SMR project,\" said Khalid Khasawneh, Commissioner for Nuclear Power Reactors at JAEC.",
            "The IAEA said Jordan was one of a growing number of countries that have expressed interest in SMRs. To better assist countries, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi established the SMR Platform in 2021 to provide coordinated, agency-wide support on all aspects of SMR development, deployment and oversight.",
            "The mission followed an IAEA workshop last year in Amman, which explored the technologies and requirements for nuclear desalination.",
            "\"Both this expert mission and the workshop are prime examples of the kind of support that the IAEA can provide to countries through the SMR Platform,\" said Dohee Hahn, Coordinator of the IAEA SMR Platform. \"In particular, newcomer countries looking to add nuclear power to their energy mix stand to benefit from the full range of Agency services accessible through the SMR Platform.\"",
            "\"The IAEA support for Jordan's nuclear programme, particularly the SMR project, is highly valued and plays a pivotal role in enhancing our capabilities and advancing our endeavors,\" Khasawneh said. \"We eagerly anticipate continued collaboration with the IAEA across all aspects of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\"",
            "\"In many ways, Jordan's interest helps to explain why small modular reactors and their applications are of such intense interest around the world right now,\" said Mikhail Chudakov, IAEA Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy. \"SMRs offer not only lower upfront costs, but greater flexibility for a variety of users and applications and are set to play an important role in helping to ensure energy security as well as supporting the clean energy transition.\"",

            "Estonia's current domestic electricity generation is dominated by fossil fuels, notably oil shale. The country is seeking to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and is looking at nuclear power as a reliable and low carbon option to diversify its energy mix by 2035 when the country plans its phase-out of domestic oil shale, according to the IAEA.",
            "Estonia was formerly part of an agreement - with Latvia, Lithuania and Poland - to build a new nuclear plant comprising two GE Hitachi ABWR reactors near the Iganlina site in Lithuania, but the project company was wound up in 2016. Now, Estonia's plans for nuclear energy feature the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs). A working group set up by the government in 2021 to review the nuclear infrastructure required for such a nuclear power programme is expected to finalise its report in December, providing recommendations to support governmental decision-making.",
            "The INIR team of international experts from Brazil and the UK, as well as six IAEA staff, reviewed the status of 19 nuclear infrastructure issues using the methodology for Phase 1 of the IAEA's Milestones Approach which evaluates the readiness of a country to make a knowledgeable commitment to a nuclear power programme.",
            "Good practices identified by the INIR team include: Estonia's commissioning of a comprehensive set of detailed studies with the support of external experts as part of its assessment to be presented to the government to support a knowledgeable decision; a strategy to support future human resource development which aims to ensure the short-term and long-term success of the nuclear power programme; and the inclusion of a review of possible locations for the geological disposal of used nuclear fuel in its assessment.",
            "Eric Mathet, operational lead of the IAEA Nuclear Infrastructure Development Section and leader of the INIR mission said Estonia is well organised in its preparations towards a decision on launching a nuclear power programme to support its net-zero carbon transition. \"During the cooperative and open discussions held over the past days, we observed the strong commitment from Estonia's highly motivated and competent professionals to developing the infrastructure needed for a nuclear power programme,\" he added.",
            "Estonia now needs to finalise its comprehensive report to support the decision on a potential nuclear power programme, including with clear timelines for the major activities, the team said. It also needs to complete its plans and policies and give further consideration to the development of its legal and regulatory framework to support the next phase of the programme.",

            "Speaking at a European Small Modular Reactor Partnership event in Bratislava, Slovakia, on 6 November, Simson said: \"After a long and intense work of preparation, we must now draw conclusions on the opportunity and potential for establishing a European Industrial Alliance on SMRs. Industrial alliances are a tool to facilitate stronger cooperation and joint action between all interested partners. Industrial alliances can play a role in achieving key EU policy objectives through joint action by all the interested partners.",
            "\"A successful deployment of SMRs by the next decade will be an important and timely milestone on our path to climate neutrality by 2050. I am confident that the EU can have a leadership role in achieving technological maturity for SMRs. This means to me that the first SMRs must be connected to the European electricity grid within a decade at the latest. This must be our goal.\"",

The Stakeholders' Forum - which took place in Brussels on 26 October - \"confirmed interest and readiness\" for an industrial alliance, she added.",
            "\"With a clear mandate from the Member States willing to use this technology in their energy mix, this determination of the stakeholders calls on the Commission to do its part and prepare the establishment of an Industrial Alliance on SMRs.",
            "\"I believe that there is today both the political opportunity and the industrial case to promote the development of SMRs in Europe. I stand ready to initiate within the Commission the necessary steps to establish the EU Industrial Alliance for SMRs early next year.\"",
            "Simson said skills and industrial competence, licensing, management of used fuel and radioactive waste will need to feature prominently in the next steps towards a European initiative on SMRs.",
            "The announcement of the creation of the industrial alliance was welcomed by Yves Desbazeille, Director General of European nuclear trade body Nucleareurope: \"SMRs are expected to bring many benefits to the EU as a whole in terms of helping to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors, as well as creating jobs and generating economic growth in the EU. The groundwork has been laid by its predecessor, the European SMR pre-Partnership and we are delighted that the European Commission is now giving its full backing to this key technology of the future.\"",

            "In a blog post, Westinghouse said the two companies had been collaborating since 2019 to evaluate deployment models for the eVinci microreactor. It said a \"multinational corporation operating strategic critical minerals assets in Canada\" had funded a study in 2019-2020 to identify reliable clean energy sources which led Prodigy to \"pioneer the development of TNPP civil structures standardised for deployment at a wide range of sites\".",
            "The eVinci microreactor is described as a \"small battery\" for decentralised generation markets and for microgrids, such as remote communities, remote industrial mines and critical infrastructure. The nominal 5 MWe heat pipe reactor, which has a heat capability of 14 MWt, features a design that Westinghouse says provides competitive and resilient power as well as superior reliability with minimal maintenance. The Prodigy Microreactor Power Station can integrate a single or multiple eVinci microreactors, would be prefabricated and transported to a site for installation at the shoreline or on land.",
            "The two companies signed an agreement in 2022, and with conceptual engineering and regulatory studies completed the next steps include \"completing the TNPP design for the eVinci microreactor, completing development of a nuclear oversight model for TNPP manufacturing, outfitting and transport, and progressing licensing and site assessments to support a first project in Canada by 2030\".",
            "Jon Ball, eVinci Technologies President for Westinghouse, said: \"From the start, our eVinci technology was designed to be transportable, that was a key design principle. So, we designed it to be small, we made it plug-and-play, and we made it deliverable to anywhere. The TNPP from Prodigy brings an additional value to the inherent transportability of the technology.\"",
            "Mathias Trojer, president and CEO of Prodigy Clean Energy, said: \"The eVinci microreactor’s compact design and simplified operating requirements make it optimal for integration into a Prodigy TNPP. Our technology will enable fleet deployment of the eVinci, accelerating the timeline to deliver clean, reliable and affordable power at commercial scale to remote regions.\"",
            "As well as a microreactor power station, Prodigy is also developing a larger version, a small modular reactor (SMR) power plant, deployable at the shoreline \"ideal for coal replacement and grid-scale power generation\". In October 2022, it unveiled a conceptual design for an SMR Marine Power Station, developed with NuScale, which could house between one and twelve NuScale Power Modules.",
            "Prodigy says that with both TNPPs it packages the microreactors or SMR into the prefabricated and relocatable power plant structures and transports them to their site, and removes them at the end of life after 60 years, so \"simplify the full facility lifecycle, dramatically reducing new build costs and complexity\".",

Holtec says the Green Boiler is a three-in-one device that: can store vast amounts of heat; receives high temperature heat conveyed to it from the solar collector; and  can make motive steam at the required pressure and superheat to power the turbine.",
            "\"The CNSP will have a much higher thermodynamic efficiency than the nuclear plant alone and would make solar power an integral part of base load supply,\" the company said. \"It should be noted that the CNSP does not use any batteries, which have been the Achilles heel of the renewable energy industry. In fact, CNSP contains no fragile parts or materials that may limit its service life, which is expected to exceed 60 years.\"",
            "Holtec believes the most immediate application of the CNSP technology is to repower coal-fired power plants, which typically have sufficient land area to house the CNSP, which would use the coal plant's existing power block, thereby minimising the cost of transition. The steam production portion of the coal plant will be decommissioned, it said, freeing up most of the plant's land area where the solar plant would reside.",
            "While it says the CNSP is adaptable for deployment in any country, the company plans to offer the technology principally in those regions of the world where \"solar radiation level is adequate to be harvestable\".",

            ": \"For thermal spectrum Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), graphite is typically utilised as moderator, reflector, and part of the core support structures. The inherent porosity within the graphite means that it is prone to infiltration by the molten salt, resulting in changes in its properties. Such property changes must be taken into consideration during reactor design and a good understanding of interaction between molten salt and the graphite microstructure is therefore important in selecting graphite grades for applications in MSRs.",

The results provided an overall description to the infiltration of molten salt into the graphite porosity. However, a more fundamental understanding of the graphite/molten salt interaction is still needed. How the pore size, shape, connectivity, and location with respect to the molten salt affect the detailed salt infiltration process remains to be understood.\"",

            "Waste management issues need to have a significantly greater prominence in the process of developing and deploying small modular reactor and advanced modular reactor designs, according to the UK's Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM).",
            "The six contenders in the UK SMR contest (Image: Composite of each firm's visuals)",
            "\"There is considerable impetus for the development of small modular reactor (SMR) and advanced modular reactor (AMR) designs and their commercial deployment, both for energy security and for environmental reasons, particularly given the historic difficulties of deploying reactors at gigawatt scale,\" CoRWM notes in a new",
            "However, it says the issue of managing the used fuel and radioactive waste from these new reactors \"appears, with some exceptions ... to have been largely ignored or at least downplayed up to now\". It adds that the issue \"must be considered when selecting technologies for investment, further development, construction and operation\".",
            "The paper says: \"This must involve addressing the uncertainties about such management at an early stage, to avoid costly mistakes which have been made in the past, by designing reactors without sufficient consideration of how spent fuel and wastes would be managed, and also to provide financial certainty for investors regarding lifetime costs of operation and decommissioning.\"",
            "CoRWM says it is essential to know: the nature and composition of the waste and, in particular, of the used fuel; its likely heat generation and activity levels; how it could feasibly be packaged and its volume; and when it is likely to arise.",
            "\"So far there is little published material from the promoters and developers of new reactor types to demonstrate that they are devoting the necessary level of attention to the waste prospectively arising from SMR/AMRs,\" it notes.",
            "The position paper provides recommendations to the UK government, Great British Nuclear (GBN), and Nuclear Waste Services and regulators to consider as SMR and AMR deployment is progressed.",
            "\"There are many questions to be answered concerning the radioactive waste and spent fuel management aspects of the design and operation of SMRs and AMRs,\" CoRWM says. \"This paper begins the process of raising them, with the caveat that our knowledge of the reactor designs and their fuel requirements is relatively immature compared with large GW reactors.\"",
            "CoRWM says there are various mechanisms by which these questions could be addressed in the process of obtaining approval for the new reactors. These are principally: the process of justification, which will be mandatory for all new reactor types; Generic Design Assessment which is optional and non-statutory; nuclear site licensing; and environmental permitting.",
            "\"The last two stages of control may in some cases come too late in the process to allow for effective optimisation of designs and the selection of materials that reduce waste,\" CoRWM says. \"It remains to be seen how effective these mechanisms will be and whether they will occur sufficiently early in the decision-making process to ensure that radioactive waste management is fully and responsibly addressed.\"",
            "CoRWM was established in 2003 as a non-statutory advisory committee and is classed as a non-departmental public body.

            "could bring billions in economic benefits, study finds",
            "The deployment of four AP1000 units in Ontario could have an impact of more than CAD28.7 billion (USD21.2 billion) on Canada's GDP during the manufacturing, engineering and construction phase alone, an independent study has found.",
            "The study was prepared by PwC (Image: Westinghouse/PwC)",
            "The Economic Impact of a Westinghouse AP1000 Reactor project in Canada",
            ", was prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC (PwC) and released at the Canadian Nuclear Association's",
            "conference in Ottawa. It was produced for Westinghouse - developer of the AP1000 pressurised water reactor technology - and its owners, Brookfield and Cameco, to assess the \"economic and broader benefits of Westinghouse's potential investment in Canada, in association with the deployment of AP1000 technology\".",
            "According to the report, Westinghouse \"is seeking to install four AP1000 units in Ontario\". The report uses Westinghouse's estimates of capital expenditures, operating expenditures and revenues associated with manufacturing, engineering, installing and operating such a project, as well as primary and secondary research conducted by PWC.",
            "Once operational, the units would create an additional CAD8.1 billion in GDP and support more than 12,000 jobs annually, the report found. As well as helping Canada achieve its emission reduction plans, the project would also open up new opportunities for Canadian suppliers: with Westinghouse planning to make local procurement a key part of its investment policy and with the majority of total capital expenditure on the project expected to be spent in Canada.",
            "Westinghouse has been expanding its engineering base in Canada in support of new nuclear projects, including the opening this year of a new engineering hub in Kitchener, Ontario, the report notes, and Canada is now the third largest engineering centre for the AP1000. An AP1000 project in Ontario will leverage and grow the existing supply chain, and the use of these Canadian suppliers to support the construction of AP1000s elsewhere could support an impact of CAD880 million for Canada for each AP1000 unit built around the world.",
            "\"Our globally-deployed AP1000 reactor fleet is a licensed and proven technology that provides exceptional availability and economics across the world,\" said Westinghouse Energy Systems President David Durham. \"This report highlights that our technology and company - with strategic investments, a growing employee base and Canadian ownership - is well suited to meet Canada’s energy needs for generations to come.\"",
            "The AP1000 project in Ontario would also develop human capital through training and education, and growing Canada's nuclear supply chain would drive greater economies and scale for deployment of additional Westinghouse technologies such as the AP300 small modular reactor and the eVinci microreactor, Westinghouse said.",
            "Five AP1000 reactors are currently fully operational - four in China and one at the Vogtle site in the USA - with the second Vogtle unit, Vogtle 4, expected to be in-service later this year. The design has been selected for deployment in Poland and Ukraine, and is under consideration at multiple other sites in Central and Eastern Europe, the UK and USA.",
            "Canada currently generates around 15% of its electricity from nuclear energy from 19 Candu pressurised heavy water reactors, 18 of which are located at three sites in Ontario. The AP1000 was submitted for possible construction at one of those sites - Ontario Power Generation (OPG's) Darlington - as long ago as 2009, but the provincial government decided in 2013 to defer future construction plans.",
            "OPG announced in 2020 that it was to resume planning activities for new nuclear at the Darlington site, where it now plans to build four BWRX-300 small modular reactors, the first of which is pencilled in for operations in 2029. As well as supporting plans for SMRs at Darlington, the Ontario government is supporting pre-development work for potential new large-scale nuclear development at Bruce Power as part of its plan to meet electricity demand and reduce emissions by supporting the electrification of the province's economy.",

            "The partners said the MoC underscores their commitment to share best practices and regulatory experience as new technologies move toward standardisation that facilitates international deployment. The agreement is expected to aid development of shared approaches for reviewing common technical safety issues to meet each country's regulatory requirements. The agencies will also collaborate on pre-application activities, research, training, and emerging novel technical issues.",
            "\"Importantly, the trilateral agreement signals a partnering approach that will improve both regulatory effectiveness and efficiency, essential given the rapid growth in reactor technologies that are seeking regulatory consideration and approval,\" ONR's Foy said. \"The agreement will ensure the efficient use of regulators' time and resources through a willingness to share technical knowledge and judgements, streamlining regulation while maintaining safety standards, acting as an exemplar of how regulators should work together in today's modern world.\"",
            "\"This agreement shows the great progress we've made with our international counterparts to ensure advanced reactor technology can be safely and efficiently deployed,\" added NRC Chair Hanson. \"We've seen our work with CNSC on joint reports support significant licensing activities on several advanced designs over the past couple of years. We look forward to ONR's contributions as we all consider applications to build SMRs and advanced reactors.\"",
            "CNSC's Jammal said: \"The CNSC is pleased to sign our first trilateral MoC with longstanding partners, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation. This provides a framework for the three nuclear regulators to work together to optimise collective skills, experience and knowledge. The agreement will help us discover greater regulatory efficiencies, and strengthen the effectiveness of our reviews of advanced reactor technologies.\"",
            "The agreement builds on the information-sharing aspects of several previous agreements, as well as recent bilateral memorandums of cooperation on small modular reactor (SMR) and advanced modular reactor (AMR) technology. International collaboration and initiatives to harmonise the regulatory process are seen as vital for the safe and successful deployment of new reactor designs such as SMRs.",

            "The US Department of Energy Loan Programs Office has conditionally committed up to USD1.52 billion for a loan guarantee to Holtec Palisades for its project to bring the Palisades plant, which ceased operations in May 2022, back online. If the project proceeds, it will be the first nuclear power plant in the USA to return to commercial operations after being closed down.",
            "Holtec agreed to purchase the 800 MWe pressurised water reactor from then-owner and operator Entergy in 2018, ahead of the scheduled closure, for decommissioning. The acquisition was completed in June 2022, within weeks of the reactor's closure, and at that time Holtec planned to complete the dismantling, decontamination, and remediation of the plant by 2041. But the company then announced plans to apply for federal funding to enable it to reopen the plant, with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer amongst those pledging support for the move. The State of Michigan's Fiscal Year 2024 budget, signed by Whitmer in mid-2023, provides USD150 million in funding towards the plant's restart.",
            "Responding to the loan guarantee announcement, Whitmer said reopening Palisades would protect 600 \"good-paying, high-skill jobs\" as well as \"clean, reliable power\" for 800,000 homes. \"Once open, Palisades will be the first successfully restarted nuclear power plant in American history, driving USD363 million of regional economic impact and helping Michigan lead the future of clean energy,\" she said.",
            "In October 2023, Holtec formally began the process of seeking reauthorisation from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to restart Palisades, having already signed a long-term power purchase agreement with the non-profit Wolverine Power Cooperative for the sale of the output from the restarted plant.",
            "Subject to NRC approvals, the project aims to bring the plant back online and upgrade it to produce baseload clean power until at least 2051, the Department of Energy (DOE) said. Restarting the plant will avoid some 4.47 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year, for a total of 111 million tonnes over the next 25 years.",
            "\"Nuclear power is our single largest source of carbon-free electricity, directly supporting 100,000 jobs across the country and hundreds of thousands more indirectly,\" said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. \"President Biden's Investing in America agenda is supporting and expanding this vibrant clean energy workforce here in Michigan with significant funding for the Holtec Palisades nuclear power plant.\"",
            "Holtec Palisades is the first project to be offered a conditional commitment through the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) programme under the US Inflation Reduction Act, a wide-ranging bill including clean energy, climate mitigation and resilience, agriculture, and conservation-related investment programmes which was signed into law in August 2022. The EIR programme can finance projects to repower existing energy infrastructure that has been non-operational, or enable operating infrastructure, to combat greenhouse gas emissions.",
            "Holtec has also said it intends to locate its first two small modular reactor units at Palisades. Although this will not be financed under the conditional commitment, the DOE said the SMR units \"would potentially add an additional 800 MW of capacity at the site, take advantage of existing infrastructure, and spur the domestic development of new reactor technologies, which is critical to combatting the climate crisis\".",
            "Palisades began commercial operation in 1971. The plant had a \"distinguished record of safe and reliable operation\", according to Holtec, with Entergy's decision to close it driven by economic, rather than operational, considerations and coincided with the expiration of a 15-year power purchase agreement with Consumers Energy.",
            "The unit was defuelled following its shutdown, but since the plant's infrastructure already exists, the project to restart it does not involve traditional major construction activities, DOE said. It will, however, require inspections, testing, refurbishment, rebuilding, and replacement of existing equipment.",
            "Holtec will be required to satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the DOE enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan.",

            "According to AMG, globally there are currently about 380 tonnes of civil-use plutonium resulting from the reprocessing of used fuel from commercial nuclear power operations in storage.",
            "\"The storage of plutonium is extremely costly due to the risks associated with plutonium,\" it noted. \"The conversion of plutonium into MOX fuel not only eliminates these risks but can be a commercially attractive alternative to storage. As an indicator, the conversion of 380 tons of plutonium into MOX translates at present fuel prices into a commercial value of USD15 to USD20 billion.\"",
            "\"The NewMOX business model is simple,\" said AMG CEO Heinz Schimmelbusch. \"There is a lot of plutonium stored and the operators of these storage facilities are seeking ways to reduce storage costs; there is the proven ALD MOX sinter furnace technology; and there is a large MOX market which will grow with the development of the emerging small modular reactor wave.",
            "\"It is the objective of NewMOX to form partnerships for the construction and operation of a commercial plutonium recycling facility producing MOX fuel starting with conceptual engineering and feasibility studies. This will take time, but this is a very valuable destination.\"",
            "The plutonium (and uranium) in used nuclear fuel can be recovered through reprocessing. The plutonium can then be used in the manufacture of MOX fuel, to substitute for fresh uranium oxide fuel. A single recycle of plutonium in the form of MOX fuel increases the energy derived from the original uranium by some 12%, and if the uranium is also recycled this becomes about 22% (based on light water reactor fuel with a burn-up of 45 GWd/tU).",
            "Today, MOX is widely used in Europe and in Japan. Currently about 40 reactors in Europe (Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and France) are licensed to use MOX, and more than 30 are doing so. In Japan, about ten reactors are licensed to use it. These reactors generally use MOX fuel as about one-third of their core, but some will accept up to 50% MOX assemblies.",

            "Installation of the digital control system has begun at the ACP100 small modular reactor demonstration project at the Changjiang site on China's island province of Hainan, China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has announced.",
            "The first cabinet of the digital control system system - the 'nerve centre' of nuclear power plant operation - was moved into place at 9.58am on 10 April, and installation and debugging work has now started, CNNC said.",
            "The digital control system (DCS) system for the ACP100 - referred to as the Linglong One - adopts two domestically-developed platforms: the Dragon Scale platform (safety level) and Dragon Fin platform (non-safety level). The Dragon Scale platform can realise reactor safety control under various working conditions and ensure the safe operation of the nuclear power plant. Meanwhile, the Dragon Fin platform is responsible for operation and management and is an important guarantee for the efficient and economical operation of the nuclear power plant. Between them, the two platforms control hundreds of systems within the nuclear power plants, nearly 10,000 equipment operations and various operating conditions.",
            "The first Dragon Fin platform cabinet that has now been put in place is a plant-wide non-safety control system specially developed by CNNC for large nuclear facilities, such as nuclear power plants. The company said this platform inherits and develops the nuclear power instrumentation and control experience and key technologies accumulated by CNNC over the years, integrating the latest advanced technologies such as data collection, process control, large-scale networking and information management to meet the requirements of high reliability and safety of nuclear facilities.",
            "\"The smooth introduction of the first DCS cabinet in Linglong One, the world's first land-based commercial small modular reactor, marks the transition of DCS to the on-site installation stage, laying the foundation for subsequent work such as the availability of the main control room,\" CNNC said.",
            "CNNC announced in July 2019 the launch of a project to construct an ACP100 reactor at Changjiang. The site is already home to two operating CNP600 pressurised water reactors (PWRs), while the construction of the two Hualong One units began in March and December 2021. Both those units are due to enter commercial operation by the end of 2026.",
            "First concrete for the ACP100 was poured on 13 July 2021, with a planned total construction period of 58 months. Equipment installation work commenced in December 2022 and the main internal structure of the reactor building was completed in March 2023.",
            "Under development since 2010, the 125 MWe ACP100 integrated PWR's preliminary design was completed in 2014. In 2016, the design became the first SMR to pass a safety review by the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
            "Once completed, the Changjiang ACP100 reactor will be capable of producing 1 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, enough to meet the needs of 526,000 households. The reactor is designed for electricity production, heating, steam production or seawater desalination.",
            "The project at Changjiang involves a joint venture of three main companies: CNNC subsidiary China National Nuclear Power as owner and operator; the Nuclear Power Institute of China as the reactor designer; and China Nuclear Power Engineering Group being responsible for plant construction.",

            "It notes: \"Nuclear energy will play a key role in achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Canada is a Tier-1 nuclear nation with over 70 years of technological leadership, including our own national reactor technology, and a strong domestic supply chain that includes the world's largest deposit of high-grade natural uranium.",
            "\"Our government is taking action to support the growth of nuclear energy, including through the Clean Electricity investment tax credit, the Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit, the Strategic Innovation Fund, the Canada Infrastructure Bank, and an updated Green Bond Framework that includes certain nuclear expenditures.\"",
            "The budget announces measures to help clarify and reduce timelines for major projects, so they can get built faster. These include setting a three-year target for nuclear project reviews, by working with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, and considering how the process can be better streamlined and duplications reduced between the two agencies.",
            "The budget proposes to provide CAD3.1 billion (USD2.2 billion) over 11 years, starting in 2025-26, with CAD1.5 billion in remaining amortisation, to Atomic Energy of Canada Limited to support Canadian Nuclear Laboratories' ongoing nuclear science research, environmental protection, and site remediation work.",
            "Commenting on the budget, the Canadian Nuclear Association said: \"While there are few new commitments or announcements that impact the nuclear energy sector, the budget in many places reinforces the government's clear support for nuclear by confirming a series of announced policies and financial commitments intended to support a rapid build out of nuclear over the coming decades.\"",
            "Around 15% of Canada's electricity comes from 19 Candu nuclear power reactors, mostly in Ontario. For many years the world's biggest producer of uranium - until it was overtaken by Kazakhstan - the country's 2022 output of 7351 tU ranks it as second in the list of the world's uranium suppliers.",

            "Holtec Maintenance & Modification International (HMI) is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and is being headed by Christopher Bakken. In its statement announcing the move, Holtec International said the new company's mission was \"to meet the time-critical maintenance and modification needs of the world’s operating nuclear power plants with assured performance certainty\".",
            "It added: \"To provide maximum value to its clients, HMI is poised to introduce cutting edge technologies such as AI-aided preventive maintenance and robot-led crew radiation dose reduction methods at its clients’ plants ... we believe the HMI management model will bring about a vastly improved control of operating costs of nuclear plants and ensure heightened plant reliability, which will support the expected renaissance in nuclear generation around the world.\"",
            "HMI will operate under its parent company's programmes on nuclear quality assurance, environmental protection, personnel safety assurance, corporate governance and supply management \"but will be otherwise autonomous\". It will work with Holtec’s Nuclear Power Division \"to provide replacement components and systems - reverse engineered as necessary to replace obsolescent items - to meet target outage schedules\".",
            "As well as its initial work on the project to restart the 840 MWe Palisades plant, Holtec says that \"discussions with other clients in the USA and overseas are under way\".",
            "Rick Springman, Holtec’s President of Global Clean Energy Opportunities, said: \"With the launch of HMI, we can now provide an integrated capability to meet the operating needs of the scores of SMR-300 plants that we hope to be building in the US and around the world.\"",
            "Holtec agreed to purchase Palisades from then-owner and operator Entergy in 2018, ahead of the scheduled closure, for decommissioning. The acquisition was completed in June 2022, within weeks of the reactor's closure, and at that time Holtec planned to complete the dismantling, decontamination, and remediation of the plant by 2041. But the company then announced plans to apply for federal funding to enable it to reopen the plant, with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer amongst those pledging support for the move. The State of Michigan's Fiscal Year 2024 budget, signed by Whitmer in mid-2023, provides USD150 million in funding towards the plant's restart. In March, the US Department of Energy Loan Programs Office conditionally committed up to USD1.52 billion for a loan guarantee to Holtec Palisades for its project to bring the Palisades plant back online. The aim is for Palisades to be back operating by the end of 2025.",
            "Holtec has also said it intends to locate its first two small modular reactor (SMR) units at Palisades. It also has hopes for fleets of its 160 MWe SMRs elsewhere - in Europe in countries including Ukraine, the Czech Republic and the UK.",

            "Stellarex Chairman Richard Carty (left) and OPG representative Jason Van Wart (right), sign the MoU watched by Minister Todd Smith (standing) (Image: CNW Group/OPG)",
            "Under the memorandum of understanding (MoU), the two partners will also explore establishing a centre of excellence for fusion energy in Ontario.",
            "Fusion energy technology development company Stellarex is a spinout of Princeton University in the USA, dedicated to the near-term realisation of commercial fusion energy production using stellarators. The stellarator approach to fusion energy uses extremely strong electromagnets to generate twisting magnetic fields to confine plamsa and create the right conditions for fusion reactions. Stellarators offer increased plasma stability compared with tokamaks, which use a torus-shaped magnetic chamber to confine the plasma, require less injected power to sustain the plasma, and allow for the burning plasma to be more easily controlled and monitored. However, stellarators are more complex than tokamaks to design and build.",
            "Stellarex has already established supply-chain and fusion ecosystem relationships in Ontario and in the Canadian nuclear sector, and has MoUs with Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, Hatch, and Kinectrics, as well as several academic institutions in the province.",
            "\"Ontario Power Generation has watched with interest as fusion-related technology has progressed over the past few years,\" OPG Senior Vice President, Enterprise Strategy and Energy Markets Kim Lauritsen. \"As the technology moves toward commercial implementation, this MOU recognises the role fusion may play as Ontario’s demand for clean energy increases over the next several decades.\"",
            "“The world is watching Ontario as we build the next generation of reliable, affordable and clean nuclear power, including the first Small Modular Reactor in the G7,\" Ontario Minister Todd Smith said at the MoU signing, which took place during a tour of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France. Ontario's well-established supply chain and experienced operators give the province a \"nuclear advantage\" and making it \"the place to be when it comes to the growing fusion-related industry, creating another opportunity for more good-paying jobs in our communities\", he added.",
            "OPG is preparing to construct the first of up to four GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy BWRX-300 small modular reactors at its Darlington site. It has already completed early-phase site preparation works, with plans to complete construction of the first unit by end of 2028 for commercial operation by the end of 2029.",
            "In May, Stellarex signed an MoU with Germany's Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics - home to Wendelsten 7-X the world’s largest stellarator-type fusion device - to partner in specific areas of fusion energy science and technology, including the optimisation of plasma confinement and power/particle control, by leveraging their shared expertise.",
            "In another initiative to explore bringing fusion energy to Ontario, Vancouver-based General Fusion - a private company which aims to build a commercial fusion power plant based on Magnetised Target Fusion technology - signed an MoU in early 2022 to collaborate with Bruce Power and Nuclear Innovation Institute to evaluate the potential deployment of a fusion power plant in Ontario.",

            "Updated with comment from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority",
            "The UK will invest at least £250 million ($377 million) over the next five years in an \"ambitious\" nuclear research and development program, according to the Conservative Party-led government's Spending Review and Autumn Statement published yesterday. British Chancellor George Osborne's 'Comprehensive Spending Review' says this program will \"revive the UK's nuclear expertise\" and position the country as \"a global leader in innovative nuclear technologies\".",
            "Funding for this program is included in the \"settlement\" for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC).",
            "\"The government's doubling of investment in DECC's innovation program will help position the UK as an international leader in small modular nuclear reactors, and deliver commitments on seed funding for promising new renewable energy technologies and smart grids,\" according to the Review.",
            "The move is part of government plans to \"prioritize energy security, whilst making reforms to meet our climate goals at lower cost\".",
            "This will include a competition to identify the best value small modular reactor (SMR) design for the UK, paving the way towards building one of the world's first SMRs in the country in the 2020s. Detailed plans for the competition will be brought forward early next year.",
            "To help back science-based and innovative companies in the north of England, the government is providing the £250 million for SMR development and wider nuclear R&D, creating opportunities for the North's centres of nuclear excellence in Sheffield City Region, Greater Manchester and Cumbria, as well as the nuclear research base across the UK. This builds on £25 million ($38 million) of UK funding for a Joint Research and Innovation Centre with China, to be based in the North West, which was announced by the Chancellor on his recent visit to Beijing and which the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) will lead for the UK.",
            "This is on top of a total of more than £375 million ($566 million) over this Parliament - 2015-2020 - for dedicated science and innovation facilities in the North, according to the Review.",
            "The launch of the investment package for SMR development and nuclear R&D is listed among \"key project starts\" for 2015-2016 and 2016-2017. Among \"key project completions\" in 2019-2020 is the development in extending the capabilities of the National Nuclear Users Facility (NNUF), which is part of the government's Nuclear Industrial Strategy announced in 2013. The aim of the NNUF is to provide greater accessibility to world leading technologies as a collaborative effort from four complimentary hubs within the UK - the Central Laboratory of NNL, the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, the Dalton Cumbrian Facility (part of The University of Manchester) and the University of Lancaster.",
            "In addition, the Review states that a new National College for Nuclear will be based in Somerset, subject to due diligence.",
            "The government will also provide more than £11 billion ($17 billion) for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) \"to continue its vital work cleaning up historic nuclear sites\". This includes \"making significant progress\" on the legacy ponds and silos at Sellafield.",
            "In 2016-2017 and 2019-2020 the government expects to save more than £1 billion ($1.5 billion) by making efficiencies and savings in the NDA through \"better value\" contracts; \"top class\" commercial procurement; delaying \"non-safety-critical\" projects; and cancelling a project that is no longer needed due to a \"world-first breakthrough\" in nuclear decommissioning research.",
            "DECC will deliver £220 million ($332 million) of resource savings by 2019-2020 through efficiencies from \"pooling back\" office and corporate services, and reducing the costs of contracts to manage the country's historic coal and nuclear liabilities, according to the Review.",
            "The Autumn Statement - at times the Summer Statement (1993–1996) and the Pre-Budget Report (1997–2009) - is one of the two statements HM Treasury makes each year to Parliament upon publication of economic forecasts, the other being the annual Budget. Osborne replaced the PBR and its policy announcements in 2010 with a new Autumn Statement focusing on economic growth and government finances as projected by the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR). Osborne's 2015 statement is a joint Autumn Statement and Spending Review – a Comprehensive Spending Review - and includes a new forecast by the OBR.",
            "Industry welcomes R&D funding",
            "NNL welcomed the announcement of £250 million in funding for a nuclear R&D program.",
            "In a statement yesterday, its managing director, Paul Howarth, said: \"I'm delighted by the news that the Government has recognised the vital importance of a UK nuclear R&D program to help return Britain to the global 'top table' of nuclear countries. This is the culmination of several years' work which began with the detailed assessment of the state of nuclear R&D carried out by the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee in 2011. Since that time, NNL has been at the forefront of the call for the establishment of a national nuclear research program and we are pleased that Government has today responded so positively to that advice. We now anticipate that NNL will play a central role in the delivery of the newly-announced program.\"",
            "Plans for an SMR in the UK in the 2020s follows the publication, in December 2014, of a feasibility report by a consortium led by NNL into the potential impact of SMR technology on the UK energy sector and the UK nuclear supply chain.",
            "Since July 2008, NNL has been providing independent advice to the government and working with other national laboratories around the world, and delivering research and technology to support the nuclear fuel cycle.",
            "In its initial response to the Comprehensive Spending Review, the UK's Nuclear Industry Association (NIA) said it welcomed the government's commitment to the nuclear sector and its additional funding for nuclear R&D, including the development of SMRs.",
            "But the civilian nuclear industry trade association urged the government \"to adopt a strategic approach to departmental spending cuts, which balanced the need for immediate cost savings with the longer term interests of the country\".",
            "Maintaining the budget for the work of the NDA \"will deliver value for the taxpayer through a progressive program of work, rather than by a stop/start approach, which significant cuts to the budget could have resulted in\", the NIA said.",
            "However, it has raised concern that no funding was allocated to develop a reuse option for the UK's plutonium stockpile. It said that \"now is the time for the Government to put firm plans in place for dealing with this valuable asset\". It added: \"Industry wants to see a timetable agreed to identify and deliver the preferred technology-led solution, with enough time for a cross-party consensus to be developed.\"",
            "Keith Parker, NIA chief executive, said the association had asked for a review which balanced short-term need with long-term gain. \"Our call for an increase to nuclear R&D to protect the future of the industry, and put UK back as a global leader in nuclear development is warmly welcomed, as is maintaining the essential work to decommission the UK's nuclear legacy. The industry's focus is on delivering the current large-scale new build projects that are essential to the UK's energy security and transition to a low carbon economy. The funding for Small Modular Reactor research is welcomed and will benefit not just the UK nuclear supply chain, but UK-plc and energy security.\"",
            "John Clarke, NDA chief executive, said: \"With this settlement, our aim will be to continue to make broad progress across our nuclear estate, but it is clear that to achieve that we and our site licence companies will need to place even greater focus on achieving efficiencies and value for money.\"",
            "The NDA will set out more details of the implications of the settlement in its draft Business Plan and Strategy documents which it will publish for consultation on 5 January. The consultations on both documents will be open for six weeks and comments will need to be returned by 15 February."

            "Firstly, the roadmap for delivery on SMRs, following the Phase 1 competition, \"to be released as soon as possible, so industry can capitalise on increasing international interest and for the UK to benefit from the supply chain and intellectual property developed here\".",
            "Secondly, \"clarity\" following the UK's decision to leave the European Union, to give investors in key infrastructure developments \"the confidence that a stable policy framework will be maintained to deliver vital new projects that promote growth\".",
            "Thirdly, \"assurance\" that the Levy Control Framework, or successor mechanism, is set for the period beyond the current 2020-21 funding cap, to accommodate Contracts for Difference agreed for further low-carbon energy infrastructure, including new large-scale nuclear power stations at Moorside in Cumbria and Wylfa Newydd in Wales.",

            "Atkinson said: \"We reached this tremendous milestone through the efforts of more than 800 people over eight years … We have documented, in extensive detail, the design conceived by Dr Jose Reyes more than a decade ago. We are confident that we have submitted a comprehensive and quality application, and we look forward to working with the NRC during its review.\"",
            "The application consisted of nearly 12,000 pages of technical information and the NRC is expected to take the next two months to determine if any additional information is required prior to commencing their review. The regulator has therefore targeted completing the certification process within 40 months. Once issued, a design certification is valid for 15 years in support of a combined licence application (COLA) to construct and operate a power plant.",
            "The Portland, Oregon-based company said that, once approved, global demand for its plants will create thousands of jobs during manufacturing, construction and operation, and \"re-establish US global leadership in nuclear technology\", paving the way for NRC approval and subsequent deployment of other advanced nuclear technologies. Conservative estimates predict about 55-75 GWe of global electricity will come from SMRs by 2035, equivalent to over 1000 NuScale Power Modules, it added.",

            "\"The journey starts with preservation of America's existing nuclear power plants, including second licence renewal to allow today's plants to operate beyond 60 years. It proceeds through construction of more large light water reactors, like the four being built in Georgia and South Carolina,\" she said. \"It further includes deployment of small modular light water reactors in the mid-2020s. And finally, development, demonstration and deployment of advanced nonlight-water reactors.\"",

When coupled to its factory fabricated power generation equipment, a NuScale Power Module can produce 50 MW of electricity. A NuScale power plant can house up to 12 of these modules for a total facility output of 600 MW (gross).",
            "A power plant's capacity can be increased in stages depending on electricity demand. Construction timeframes - about 36 months for each module - can make it easier for a smaller utility to raise capital and allow quicker returns on an investment while the rest of the plant is under construction, NEI said. In addition, each module can be built at an off-site factory and shipped to the plant site via truck, train or barge.",
            "The NuScale design also has unique safety characteristics: under abnormal conditions, the reactor can shut itself down and cool itself for indefinite periods without the need for human intervention, water addition or external electricity supplies.",
            "NuScale has been working on its SMR design for more than ten years, with initial development and testing at Oregon State University. In 2011, the global engineering, procurement and construction firm Fluor Corp became the majority investor in NuScale.",

            "\"The company has discussed this approach with us since 2008, using much the same 'pre-application' process followed by makers of traditional large reactors. These talks helped both the NRC and NuScale understand where the design might need additional supporting information or alternative approaches to NRC policies. For instance, NuScale examined how its design could best meet the NRC's requirements for staff in the control room,\" Burnell said.",
            "The NRC also used information from NuScale in developing a design-specific review standard. This ensures the agency's technical staff has specific guidance on the requirements NuScale must meet to get the novel small modular design approved, he said. The NRC published the draft review standard in July 2015 and after public comment, issued the final review standard in August 2016.",

The study compared water production rates and economic efficiencies for each technology. For RO, a single dedicated NuScale module was found to produce up to 340,000 cubic meters of potable water. One module was also found able to produce about 30,000 cubic meters of clean water using steam extraction, plus 30 MW of power, when coupled with MSF technology. For MED technology, one module produces some 50,000 cubic meters of water through steam extraction, plus 30 MW of electricity.he",
            "A study with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) and Energy Northwest considered NuScale's capabilities for following electric load requirements as they vary with demand and variable output from renewables. The study looked at the use of a single NuScale module to balance output from the 58 MWe wind farm at UAMPS's Horse Butte site in southern Idaho.",
            "According to Bergman, there are three ways of changing the power output from a NuScale plant. The first is by taking one or more modules offline for extended period of low grid demand or sustained wind output. The second is to adjust reactor power for one or more modules over intermediate time frames, while the third, which is suitable for short time frames, is to bypass turbine steam to the condenser.",
            "\"You can't really operate a nuclear power plant like that, just on control rods and fuel,\" he noted.",
            "\"There are certain parts of the country or industries that need very reliable power - they can't afford to go without power,\" he said. \"We call that critical infrastructure and we did a study showing what kind of reliability you can achieve with NuScale depending on your power needs.\"",
            "Connection to a micro-grid and the ability for 100% turbine bypass allows a NuScale plant to assure 100 MWe net power at 99.99% reliability over a 60-year operating life.",
            "\"Our design has some unique features that help with these alternative uses of nuclear power,\" Bergman said.",
            "NuScale's self-contained SMR design houses the reactor core, pressuriser and steam generator inside a single containment vessel. It relies on convection, not pumps, to circulate water in the primary circuit. A single module can generate 50 MWe (gross) of electricity and is just under 25 meters in length, 4.6 meters in diameter and weighs around 450 tonnes. A power plant could include as many as 12 NuScale modules to produce as much as 600 MWe (gross).",
            "In December, NuScale submitted the first-ever SMR design certification application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which the NRC accepted on 15 March. The first commercial NuScale power plant is planned for construction on the site of the Idaho National Laboratory for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems and operated by Energy Northwest."

            "podcast, which you can also listen to via the embedded player below or",
            "The importance of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization",
            "I would say, as an organisation, it's one of the pillar of the Non Proliferation Treaty. We can talk about peaceful use of nuclear energy but it has always been that frontier, between the peaceful use ... and the work is important because it does stop countries from conducting nuclear test explosions in the search to develop nuclear weapons and as such, it does keep the framework of the peaceful use of nuclear energy together with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other organisations dealing with the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.",
            "What would you see as the main benefits new nuclear energy could bring to Africa?",
            "I would say industrial development. Energy is very scarce in Africa, we have a shortage of energy. South Africa is the only country to have an operating nuclear power plant and Egypt is following soon. Industrial development goes with energy and when energy is expensive like in my country, Burkina Faso, where electricity is one of the most expensive in the world, industrial development will be difficult to achieve. So the key is to have the energy to help developing countries to have access to industrial development - and then industrial development will help with the economy and also the day-to-day improvement of our population's life.",
            "What needs to change for more peaceful nuclear energy to be in place across countries in Africa?",
            "I think the main thing that needs to be changed in Africa and the developing world is mentality, and making clear to people the difference between atomic bombs and nuclear energy, the peaceful use of nuclear energy. There is also the institutional framework that was set for the African Development Bank, World Bank and some other institutions where it was clearly said that they shouldn't get involved in nuclear. But nuclear issues at that time, post World War Two, was mainly about nuclear weapons, not the peaceful use of nuclear energy. I think that's something that we still have to work on to change the mentality so that people see the benefit of nuclear energy.",
            "Is this reflected in public opinion?",
            "I think things are changing with education, capacity building and the effort of some developing countries to get students to be more and more involved in nuclear science and technology. I think communication and social media is helping ... innovation, science and technology has brought nuclear energy and nuclear issues to be close to the safety that was the main issue in the beginning. Innovation, science, technology and the improvement in safety and security - I think those are issues that we really have to to take into account",
            "What difference will small modular reactors make?",
            "We shouldn't forget that the issue of small modular reactors started very long ago, but political issues sometimes, or often, put some technological innovation to bed because people have difficulty accepting or understanding that nuclear energy should be seen as a green energy, or that nuclear energy in terms of how things have evolved is a lot less risky. Those are the issues that have been an impediment to the development of the peaceful use of nuclear energy and small modular reactors, with the safety and security aspect that they are bringing today, will be a game changer.",
            "What about non-electricity applications?",
            "Non-electricity applications, such as the IAEA's Rays of Hope under the leadership of Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, includes medical aspects and other scientific issues and improving the shortage of water with desalinisation. There is also the integration of hydrogen production and I'm sure in the years to come we'll see more innovation and scientific development to help change minds, and then get the peaceful use of nuclear energy rising to a point which we might have thought would be impossible",
            "What is the current position in Rwanda?",
            "Under the leadership of President Kagame, there is the vision for a small country like Rwanda to make sure energy is accessible and affordable to all, and I'm working on that, not just for energy but also nuclear science and technology centre - capacity building and capacity development is key, with safety and security integrated into what we do on a daily basis and also a regional framework. I see Rwanda as a pilot country in many respects, we can see how we can cooperate with others and spread that across the continent",
            "I am on the Nano board and we are working on a feasibility study - there are 100 acres given by the government for nuclear science and technology. In Rwanda we have engaged in training people, to build an education and training centre and make it accessible to students and people regionally and our aim is to have a ministerial round table discussion where we bring those in Africa who are interested in this field to talk, to work together to combine efforts in order to go as quickly and as best as possible to achieve the peaceful use of nuclear energy in the continent.",
            "What is the message to international organisations and the international industry?",
            "There is a big competition in term of innovation, science and technology, especially with the small modular reactors. We just have to get going. We just have to work on capacity building and capacity development and then countries will have to make the choice about what's the best and most cost-effective way to approach the individual issue as a country or as a region - I think nuclear energy is too big to be a single country focus, I think it has to be more a regional issue and I would encourage regional institutions to get involved in that process so that when you talk about establishing a nuclear power plant, be it a traditional one or a small modular reactor, that it goes not on a country-to-country basis because I don't think each African country will have its nuclear power plant, but I think it will work on a sub-regional or regional basis.",
            "Africa is a major producer of uranium, what further potential do you see?",
            "Many people are asking themselves why a country like Niger would be a big producer of uranium and yet doesn't even have a nuclear power plant ... it is becoming a topic of discussion among the youth and, you know, Africa is a young continent. This is a topic where they want to be involved, they want first to understand, and then they want to see why our leaders haven't thought of it long ago ... to make the use of our resources, especially uranium, to focus on how Africa can use it for its own benefit while thinking about cooperating with the rest of the world in terms of supplying uranium ... or bringing the technology to be local and using what we have to produce electricity for the benefit of our population.",
            "How to explain the relative lack of nuclear power plants in Africa, historically?",
            "I would say it was because of international attitudes to the proliferation risk, but things have changed and we have standards today, we have the International Atomic Energy Agency and many other institutions working on standards and in the institutional framework. Security and safety have evolved and technology has changed and the mentality will have to change. The international community will have to change accordingly and then let the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and the development of nuclear power plants and the small modular reactor be more democratic, if I can use this word, than it has been in the past. My dream is to see energy everywhere and energy for all in Africa in the developing world.",

            "The plans include next steps for exploring a large-scale nuclear power plant as well as SMRs. The roadmap also includes a government ambition to secure 3–7 GW worth of investment decisions every five years from 2030 to 2044 on new nuclear projects.",
            "According to the government, plans to streamline the development of new nuclear power plants and introduce smarter regulation could speed up the overall process and, as a result, the delivery of nuclear power in the UK. This includes allowing regulators to assess projects while designs are finalised, and better cooperation with overseas regulators assessing the same technology.",
            "Earlier this week, the government announced it will also invest up to GBP300 million (USD381 million) in UK production of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), which is currently only commercially produced in Russia. HALEU - uranium enriched to between 5% and 20% uranium-235 - will be used in the advanced nuclear fuel required for most of the next-generation reactor designs currently under development.",
            "The government has also published two consultations, one on a new approach",
            "to siting future nuclear power plants",
            "and another on supporting the sector and",
            "encouraging private investment to roll out advanced nuclear projects",
            ". The proposals aim to \"attract investment in the UK nuclear sector by empowering developers to find suitable sites rather than focusing on eight designated by government\".",
            "The roadmap says: \"The coming years are expected to bring further clarity on the costs and effectiveness of new nuclear technology. This may require us to re-evaluate some of our strategies and policies for the long term. To take account of these developments, we therefore intend to publish a Roadmap 'update' by the end of 2025.\"",
            "\"Nuclear is the perfect antidote to the energy challenges facing Britain - it's green, cheaper in the long term and will ensure the UK's energy security for the long-term,\" said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. \"This is the right long-term decision and is the next step in our commitment to nuclear power, which puts us on course to achieve net-zero by 2050 in a measured and sustainable way. This will ensure our future energy security and create the jobs and skills we need to level up the country and grow our economy.\"",
            "Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Claire Coutinho added: \"We're making the biggest investment in domestic nuclear energy in 70 years ... From large gigawatt projects to small modular reactors, the UK's wider nuclear revival will quadruple our nuclear capacity by 2050 – helping to power Britain from Britain.\"",
            "\"The government's investment in nuclear will ensure the UK remains at the forefront of technological developments,\" said Minister for Nuclear Andrew Bowie. \"Our plans will give investors the confidence to back new UK projects, with a simpler process for locating new schemes and clear support for private sector companies developing innovative new technologies.\"",

            "He said: \"It's a very comprehensive document, a great step forward and a step in the right direction for forming the UK's new nuclear programme, which we will be accountable for delivering alongside our colleagues in Sizewell and Hinkley.\"",
            "The release of the roadmap was welcomed by industry, with Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of Nuclear Industry Association, saying: \"We will need both large and small nuclear at scale and at pace for our energy security and net-zero future. Allowing developers to engage with the government about Regulated Asset Base funding models should also make it cheaper to finance projects, cutting costs to the consumer. Decisions on 3-7 GW in each five year period provide the greater clarity and predictability, which in turn enables supply chain investment and more UK content in the future fleet.",
            "\"The commitments to maximise our use of regulatory assessments already undertaken overseas will help get innovative reactor designs into construction faster and reduce the duplication in regulatory activity that eats up time for no additional benefit.\"",
            "World Nuclear Association Director General Sama Bilbao y León added: \"The UK government’s roadmap to streamline the process of future nuclear development and quadruple nuclear energy in the UK by 2050 is a pragmatic example of the positive action now being taken to deliver on the commitments made by those countries that endorsed the net zero nuclear Ministerial Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy at COP28. The UK was a founding government partner of our Net Zero Nuclear initiative and I welcome today’s announcement.\"",

            "Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) and Bechtel have entered into a formal alliance to design, license and deploy B&W's mPower reactor design. B&W announced plans for the 125 MWe modular nuclear power reactor in June 2009.",
            "Cutaway of a single mPower module inside its own independent, underground containment (Image: B&W)",
            "B&W, a subsidiary of McDermott International, describes the mPower reactor design as \"a passively safe Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) with a below-ground containment structure,\" and is air-cooled. According to B&W, \"this optimized ALWR represents true Generation III++ nuclear technology that B&W believes can be certified, manufactured and operated within today's existing US regulatory, industrial supply chain and utility operational infrastructure.\"",
            "The mPower is an integral PWR designed to be factory-made and railed to site. The reactor pressure vessel containing core and steam generator is thus only a few metres in diameter. It will have a \"conventional core and standard fuel\" enriched to 5%, presumably with burnable poisons, to give a five-year operating cycle between refuelling. This is intended to provide a low-cost approach to plant operations. B&W notes that nuclear security and near-term management of used fuel would be improved through the underground containment design that will store fuel for the planned 60-year life of the plant.",
            "When announcing the design, B&W said that the \"scalable nature of nuclear power plants built around the B&W mPower reactor would provide customers with practical power increments of 125 MWe to meet local energy needs within power grid and plant site constraints.\" Several units would be combined into a power station of any size, but most likely 500-750 MWe and using 250 MWe turbine generators, constructed in three years.",
            "Under the new alliance - to be known as Generation mPower - B&W will focus on designing and testing the nuclear steam supply system (NSSS) and nuclear island, including the design certification application development and submission, and NSSS production. Bechtel will complement these responsibilities with integrated engineering and project management leadership.",
            "Chris Mowry, president of B&W Nuclear Energy, said: \"The formation of our Generation mPower alliance demonstrates a new level of commitment by American industry to address the growing challenge of climate change in an economical and practical way with small modular reactor technology. It brings together industry leaders in the areas of nuclear technology, manufacturing and construction.\"",
            "He added, \"We believe that Generation mPower positions us to collectively deliver greater certainty in nuclear project cost and schedule, which are necessary to enable broader, more timely deployment of nuclear power.\"",
            "Jack Futcher, president of Bechtel's power business commented: \"The formation of Generation mPower is a turning point in the nuclear power plant industry - it has the potential to be a real game changer.\"",
            "He said, \"This alliance intends to advance the development and deployment of nuclear power in a way that makes nuclear power more accessible to utilities and more affordable to consumers. Bechtel brings the plant engineering, procurement and construction capability to complement B&W's expertise in nuclear engineering and manufacturing. Together, we have the resources, experience and expertise to deliver on the promise of a new clean energy option.\"",
            "A memorandum of understanding was signed last year by B&W, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and a consortium of regional municipal and cooperative utilities to explore the construction of a fleet of mPower reactors to meet the consortium's need to diversify its power generation assets.",
            "In a joint statement, B&W and Bechtel said, \"Depending on regulatory approval and other factors, the first plant could be deployed as early as 2020.\""

            "A new industrial strategy published by the UK government sets out detailed plans to enable the country to make the most of opportunities for economic growth in the nuclear energy sector at home and abroad.",
            "Sellafield, focus of much of the UK's decommissioning program (Image: Sellafield Ltd)",
            "Announced in a joint statement by the UK's business secretary Vince Cable and energy secretary Ed Davey, the 90-page industrial strategy document entitled",
            "is the latest stage in governmental plans to publish strategies for eleven key sectors. It sets out the government's \"clear expectation that nuclear will play a significant role in the UK energy mix in the future\" and outlines the government's plans to align the UK as a leading civil nuclear energy nation. It covers the nuclear energy industry in its entirety, encompassing new build, waste management and decommissioning, fuel cycle services, and operations and maintenance.",
            "A key commitment covered by the strategy is £15 million ($23 million) to establish a new National Nuclear Users Facility for universities and companies carrying out nuclear technology research, with centres at the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) at Sellafield, the Culham Centre for Fusion Technology and the University of Manchester's Dalton Cumbrian facility. £18 million ($27 million) of support awarded to 35 nuclear research and development (R&D) projects. £12.5 million ($19 million) is committed to the UK's decision to join the Jules Horowitz Test Reactor Program, announced earlier this month. Future reactor designs and their fuel cycles will be kept under review, including consideration of the feasibility of launching a small modular reactor (SMR) R&D program that would enable the UK to be a key partner of any new reactor design for the global market.",
            "The strategy outlines actions needed to attract domestic and inward investment in nuclear projects and to help firms penetrate overseas markets and also to ensure that the UK has the necessary skills for the future.",
            "The document builds on a major review into UK nuclear R&D capability undertaken in response to a House of Lords inquiry into the country's nuclear R&D capacities which has also been published. The raft of documents includes a vision statement setting out the country's nuclear industry ambitions over the next 40 years and a roadmap setting out R&D activities and timelines.",
            "The strategy sees the mission and role of the NNL change to enable it to take on a more central role in advising the government on nuclear issues and strategic research projects. The NNL will also be responsible for hosting the Nuclear Innovation Research Office (NIRO) which will take forward the work of the newly-created Nuclear Innovation Research Advisory Board (NIRAB), which will work to help define a national nuclear energy R&D program.",
            "Vince Cable said that the nuclear industry provided significant opportunities for economic growth, while Ed Davey noted that nuclear and other low-carbon power would be crucial to the UK going forward. \"We need all our energy options in play in the fight against climate change, and to keep the lights on in a way that is affordable to consumers. Not just this decade, but to 2050 and beyond,\" he said.",
            "The strategy has been widely welcomed by spokespeople from the nuclear industry and academic sectors. UK Nuclear Industry Association chairman Lord Hutton applauded the government's \"firm commitment\" to nuclear's continuing role, while the UK government's chief scientific advisor John Beddington said the announcements on R&D and skills were the first steps to meeting potential future demands that could exceed current new-build plans.",
            "The strategy is published a week after planning consent was granted for Hinkley Point C, the UK's first new nuclear power plant in 25 years. EDF Energy plans to build two Areva EPR reactors at the site, but the company has yet to reach a final investment decision on the project. Discussions are still ongoing between EDF subsidiary Nuclear New Build Generation and the UK government about financial terms for the project. Under the contract for difference (CfD) mechanism, a generator's income would be topped up when market prices for power are below a so-called strike price. Strike prices are to be set for all forms of low-carbon power generation."

            "The USA's partially built Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF), a key component of the country's plutonium disposition program, is to be placed on cold standby after being effectively cut out of the Department of Energy's (DoE's) FY2015 budget request.",
            "MFFF, pictured in May 2013, with the exterior structure of the facility complete (Image: Shaw Areva MOX Services)",
            "The DoE's $27.9 billion budget request includes $11.7 billion for the US National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the body responsible for US non-proliferation activities including the plutonium disposition program as well as the maintenance of the nation's nuclear arsenal. That arsenal now needs extensive - and expensive - modernisation to keep it safe. Of the $11.7 billion the DoE has requested for NNSA, the lion's share - $8.3 billion - is earmarked for its weapons activities appropriation, including $2.7 billion for stockpile modernisation. The MFFF receives nothing.",
            "The MFFF is being built by Shaw Areva MOX services to fulfil the USA's commitments under a bilateral agreement with Russia, in which both countries have committed to dispose of some 34 tonnes of weapons-usable plutonium into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for use in civilian nuclear reactors. Work started on the plant at Savannah River, South Carolina, in 2007, with a 2016 startup envisaged. Although based on France's Melox MOX facility, the MFFF project has presented many first-of-a-kind challenges and in 2012 the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) suggested it would likely not start up before 2019 and cost at least $7.7 billion, far above original estimates of $4.9 billion.",
            "The project has seen progressive cuts to its budget, with only $320 million requested for the facility in the 2014 budget reflecting a slowing down of construction and associated activities as the NNSA embarked a review of its plutonium disposition strategy.",
            "The FY2015 budget request cites the anticipated cost overrun as its reason for suspending the MOX facility project. \"As part of an ongoing analysis of options to dispose of US surplus plutonium, it has become apparent that the MFFF will be significantly more expensive than anticipated, and therefore, the budget request places the MOX facility in cold stand-by while the department evaluates plutonium disposition options,\" the budget request states. The costs of putting the project on cold standby will come from the $1.6 billion set aside in the budget request for NNSA's nuclear non-proliferation activities.",
            "Areva Inc says that the cold standby decision is a euphemism for the termination of the project. In a press release, the company said that by dropping the project from the budget the DoE was effectively calling for a cessation of a previously approved program. \"We note that the NNSA says it conducted a 'year-long review' of the project that they say may provide alternatives more quickly and cost effectively, and for this reason the MOX project will be stopped. However, we have not seen the results of this review, but we would welcome the opportunity to do so,\" Areva Inc said.",
            "In addition to the $11.9 billion requested for NNSA, DoE's FY2015 budget includes $863 million for the Office of Nuclear Energy, for ongoing research and development in advanced reactor and fuel cycle technologies as well as the DoE's small modular reactor (SMR) licensing technical support program, for which $97 million is set aside.",
            "US nuclear industry representatives said that the overall budget sent \"mixed signals\" on nuclear energy. Alex Flint, senior vice president for governmental affairs at the US Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), praised DoE's ongoing support for small reactors and the inclusion of $79 million for activities to advance its used nuclear fuel management program but questioned proposals to impose taxes on nuclear energy companies to finance the cleanup of DoE enrichment facilities in Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee. Regarding the MFFF, the NEI questioned any abandonment of the project, saying that to do so would leave plutonium in a weapons-usable state for the foreseeable future. \"The ongoing construction of the MOX fuel fabrication facility at Savannah River Site - now 60% complete - should be finished, not placed into 'cold standby'\", Flint said."

            "Developing new nuclear technologies requires overcoming considerable financial and regulatory hurdles, as the promise of clean, efficient electricity remains essential to US energy policy, the Nuclear Energy Institute said, following a meeting on 11 December of a House Science Committee.",
            "Department of Energy assistant secretary for nuclear energy Pete Lyons reiterated President Barack Obama administration's policy that nuclear energy must be a part of any energy plan whose goals include lower carbon dioxide emissions, NEI said. Nuclear power plants already supply more than 60% of the USA's zero-carbon electricity, and closing them would result in a \"significant loss of low-carbon energy,\" Lyons said, according to the Washington-based industry body.",
            "He also called for government cost-sharing programs to support the development of small and advanced reactors. He pointed to the Nuclear Power 2010 program, which brought next-generation reactors like the Westinghouse AP1000 to the construction phase, and the Small Modular Reactor (SMR) Licensing Technical Support Program that has partnered the federal government with Babcock & Wilcox and NuScale Power to accelerate the licensing of small reactor technologies.",
            "Daniel Lipman, NEI's executive director for policy development and supplier programs, said, \"Companies like Babcock & Wilcox, NuScale and others are prepared to absorb a significant share of the technology design and development costs, but the federal government must also play a significant role - particularly given the enormous promise of SMR technology.\"",
            "Lipman noted that B&W has invested about $400 million in developing mPower and NuScale about $260 million in its eponymous reactor design - \"significant sums of money that will not generate any return for their creators for at least a decade,\" NEI said.",
            "NuScale is involved in negotiations for an initial project in Idaho, according to Mike McGough, NuScale's chief commercial officer. He echoed Lipman's sentiment that the partnership among the small reactor developers and the federal government, in which the companies are investing, is crucial to a successful deployment of the technology. \"Successful completion of the SMR cost-share program depends on sustained Congressional support through continued appropriations,\" McGough said.",
            "Lipman also addressed ways to improve prospects for funding nuclear energy projects. NEI has recommended that the government consider innovative approaches to close the funding gap, such as the Title XVII loan guarantee program. For example, Lipman said, design, engineering and licensing costs could be folded into the cost of a project and financed through the loan guarantee program. Doing this would permit a project developer to fund more of these costs through debt financing and repay it over a longer period of time.",
            "Another issue hindering small and advanced reactor technology is regulatory uncertainty, NEI said.",
            "Lipman said the problem is a lack of an NRC-approved regulatory roadmap for new reactors, complicated by the commission's hesitation to create regulation in the absence of a submitted design.",
            "Leslie Dewan, chief executive officer of Transatomic Power, expanded on this issue as it applies to advanced reactor designs.",
            "\"The regulatory system works well for light water reactors, but it needs to be broadened to successfully encompass advanced reactors as well, so that the US can start taking advantage of the benefits of these new designs,\" Dewan said. She proposed that the USA develops a national test bed facility to build demonstration-scale advanced reactors, an idea echoed by Ashley Finan, senior project manager of the Clean Air Task Force.",
            "If the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) participated in the advanced reactor test bed projects, Dewan said, \"NRC staffers would be building up the necessary expertise to license commercial-scale plants in the future.\" This head start on licensing could reduce the cost and timeline of licensing an advanced reactor and increase operational certainty, allowing for a better likelihood that private capital can be raised to fund them, NEI said.",
            "Lyons also addressed regulatory issues. He said the NRC's 10 CFR Part 52 combined construction and licensing procedure \"allows the end product to be a design that does not have to redo safety tests each time\" it is deployed."

The solicitation for projects, including the construction of advanced nuclear reactors, small modular reactors, uprates and upgrades at existing facilities, and front-end nuclear facilities eligible for such support, was announced in December 2014. The new supplement clarifies that costs incurred by an eligible project as part of the NRC licensing process, such as design certification, construction permits, combined construction and operating licences, might also be eligible for a DOE loan guarantee.",

            "UK regulators expect to complete the Generic Design Assessment (GDA) process for the Westinghouse AP1000 and Hitachi-GE's UK Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (UK ABWR) in March and December of 2017, respectively. In its quarterly GDA report for February to April 2016 issued yesterday, the Office for Nuclear Regulation also said it has \"developed 'entry criteria' to provide transparency on the factors that underpin our decision on readiness to commence GDA\" for China General Nuclear's HPR1000 design.",
            "NuGeneration (NuGen), the UK joint venture between Japan's Toshiba and France's Engie, plans to build a nuclear power plant of up to 3.8 GWe gross capacity at Moorside, in West Cumbria using AP1000 nuclear reactor technology provided by Westinghouse Electric Company, a group company of Toshiba. Horizon Nuclear Power - established in 2009 and acquired by Hitachi in November 2012 - plans to deploy the UK ABWR at two sites - Wylfa Newydd, which is on the Isle of Anglesey, and Oldbury-on-Severn, in South Gloucestershire.",
            "The UK EPR design became the first reactor design to complete the GDA process and receive a Design Acceptance Confirmation (DAC) from the ONR and a Statement of Design Acceptability (SoDA) from the Environment Agency in December 2012. Under a deal agreed last October, China General Nuclear will take a 33.5% stake in EDF Energy's £18 billion ($28 billion) project to construct Hinkley Point C, in Somerset, which will comprise two Areva EPR units. In addition, the two companies will develop projects to build new plants at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex, the latter using Chinese reactor technology - the HPR1000.",
            "In its previous update, the ONR highlighted its concerns with progress on the GDA for the AP1000 and \"lack of technical convergence\" in some topic areas.",
            "The period of the latest report saw some progress, it said, \"particularly around convergence and there is therefore only one area where discussions continue\". In terms of the closure program, the ONR said Westinghouse had revised and extended its schedule and now seeks to complete the GDA process in March 2017, two months later than planned.",
            "\"We have seen an improvement overall in the Westinghouse approach to GDA closure, as a result of its executive-level interventions and revised project governance. However we remain concerned over the volume of work to be delivered, and judge that our planned 'health check' review scheduled for July 2016 will be important in informing the level of confidence we have in the revised closure program,\" the ONR said.",
            "The UK ABWR project is \"in a period of intensive assessment\" as it progresses through Step 4 of the GDA process.",
            "\"We continue to consider the project stable overall, and although there are technical issues that continue to emerge, they are being appropriately managed,\" the ONR said. \"We remain focused on identifying any further design changes and safety case developments that may be required (in addition to those already made), to enable Hitachi-GE to address them within the current programme timescales.\"",
            "The Environment Agency is continuing to carry out its assessments and is working towards beginning consultation on its findings so far later this year, according to the report. Natural Resources Wales is also working towards this consultation.",
            "Overall the regulators consider that a DAC and SoDA for the UK ABWR in December 2017 is achievable, the ONR said.",
            "There were no interactions between regulators and the proposed requesting party for the HPR1000 GDA in the period covered by the latest report, ONR noted. But the fact they have developed 'entry criteria' is important, it said, as regulators are required to advise the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) on whether a potential requesting party - in this instance, CGN and EDF - is ready to start GDA.",
            "The report also provided an update on its preparations to assess small modular reactor designs. In March 2016, following conclusion of the techno-economic assessment, DECC announced a competition to identify the best value SMR design for the UK.",
            "\"As it is clear that government is progressing work in this area, the regulators have started to think about what challenges technology of this nature may present to the current regulatory regime. We also consider that our knowledge of reactor technology may be helpful to DECC in the design and implementation of the competition, and will provide assistance if requested,\" the ONR said."

            "Two Westinghouse AP1000s are likely to start up within a year, with hot functional tests at the first-of-a-kind reactor at Sanmen in China on course to finish next month, interim president and CEO José Emeterio Gutiérrez told delegates at the World Nuclear Association's Annual Symposium held in London last week. Fuel loading at Sanmen is expected to take place before the end of the year.",
            "José Emeterio Gutiérrez (L) at the Annual Symposium (Image: World Nuclear Association)",
            "Hot functional testing is also under way at the second AP1000, Haiyang 1, and is making faster progress thanks to the experience and lessons learned at Sanmen 1. Two units are under construction at each site.",
            "\"Hopefully, very soon we will have four AP1000s connected to the grid in China,\" Gutiérrez said.",
            "Lessons learned from the Chinese AP1000 projects are also being applied to the AP1000s under construction in the USA. These units, at VC Summer and Vogtle, are about two years behind the Chinese plants, Gutiérrez said. Summer 2 passed a major milestone recently with the installation of its reactor pressure vessel, and Gutiérrez said a similar milestone would be reached at Vogtle 3 \"within weeks\".",
            "Westinghouse is \"very optimistic\", he said, about the prospect of AP1000 construction in India: \"There is strong commitment from the government of India, specifically from Prime Minister Modi, to grow nuclear in India.\" He cited Modi's public statement, made during a visit to Washington DC earlier this year, that he was \"minded to support\" Westinghouse's project. Working with Indian partners, this would see construction of six AP1000s with a commitment to having an EPC contract in place by June 2017.",
            "A site has already been allocated, and negotiations are ongoing with customers and partners in India, Gutiérrez said. \"Hopefully by this time next year, we will be talking about a real project, and a project under construction,\" he said.",
            "Westinghouse's global reach has enabled it to transfer and share both resources and experience between its projects in China, the USA, India and the UK, he said. The AP1000 design is approaching the end of the UK regulatory generic design assessment (GDA) process, which it is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2017.",
            "As well as the AP1000 - which NuGen plans to build at Moorside in West Cumbria - Westinghouse has also proposed its small modular reactor (SMR) for use in the UK. The UK government earlier this year announced a competition to identify the best value SMR for possible future deployment in the country. Completion of the AP1000 GDA would be a \"very important milestone\" and Westinghouse is \"very excited\" about its SMR, Gutiérrez said.",
            "The Westinghouse SMR would benefit from the company's experience of licensing a reactor in the UK, he added. It incorporates many of the passive safety features from the AP1000 which have already been licensed, and the reactor is therefore not entirely a first-of-a-kind design using new technology, he said. He also noted that Westinghouse has a large footprint in the UK, with fuel production facilities at Springfields that have already been qualified to manufacture SMR fuel, and an established supply chain. These and other considerations make development and deployment of SMR technology in the UK a \"real opportunity\" in the short term, he said.",
            "While working with customers to maximise localisation in their nuclear supply chain, Westinghouse's global reach and flexibility could further leverage opportunities for increased efficiencies, Gutiérrez said. This could be achieved by combining resources and bringing in global experience and ready-qualified suppliers, where appropriate.",
            "While new build was \"wonderful,\" Guitérrez said Westinghouse remained focused on providing support and services to keep the world's existing nuclear fleet in operation. \"We cannot forget that we have more than 400 reactors in operation today […] Those reactors must continue operating safely and economically,\" he said.",
            "He confirmed that Westinghouse is looking to invest in technologies and \"new ideas\" in the decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) area. \"Unfortunately, the D&D business is growing,\" he said, referencing recent nuclear power plant closures. He said it was \"important to recognise\" that the nuclear industry is expected to restore and clean its retired facilities and sites, to protect the environment and to \"take care\" of all of its waste. \"There are technologies, there are solutions, and Westinghouse is working on them,\" he said."

            "Small modular reactors (SMRs) could be operating in the UK by 2030 if action is taken to create investor confidence through development of a suitable policy framework, according to a new report by the Energy Technologies Institute (ETI).",
            "Preparing for Deployment of a UK Small Modular Reactor by 2030",
            "- examines the steps that will need to be taken by government, regulators, reactor vendors and operators in a \"credible integrated schedule\" that would see construction of a first-of-a-kind reactor starting in 2025 with the reactor itself in operation by 2030.",
            "To achieve such a schedule will require government action to create investor confidence through the development of a policy framework to reduce the risks for an SMR developer, particularly during the first five years of the program, the report finds. Enabling roles the government would need to undertake would include promoting early engagement with vendors, enhancing the confidence of private sector investors, and taking steps to limit uncertainty in the investment case.",
            "Report author Mike Middleton said the ETI's analysis shows that it is possible for the UK to have a first-of-a-kind SMR in operation by 2030 if developers, government and regulators work together in an integrated program.",
            "\"Creating the right environment for increasing investor confidence is critical if this schedule is to be met; there will be a key role for government in the first five years of any such program to deliver an SMR policy framework which progressively reduces investor risk,\" he said.",
            "The report also finds that future UK deployment of SMRs should consider their use as combined heat and power (CHP) plants, supplying power to district heating systems, which it says could bring further economic benefits. Due to their smaller size and potentially easier siting than large-scale nuclear plants, SMRs could potentially deliver heat into cities via hot water piplelines and help to decarbonise energy use in buildings. The additional costs of using SMRs for CHP would be small, while the revenues from doing so could potentially be large and bring benefits to both consumers and operators. SMRs should therefore be deployed as \"CHP ready\" - even if there are no plans in place for district heating systems yet in place.",
            "\"UK regulatory assessment through Generic Design Assessment is a big commitment. If SMR designs can combine standardised production in factories with developer options for heat take-off and cooling systems then there are two benefits. Firstly, these options can increase deployment opportunities which can further reduce unit cost; secondly, it is not necessary to reassess the design or reconfigure the factory production process to deliver these options and again this reduces downstream deployment costs,\" Middleton said.",
            "The ETI study also found a range of sites that could potentially be suitable for the deployment of SMRs, including sites adjacent to existing nuclear power stations and adjacent to current or historic thermal power stations as well as locations not previously used for power generation. \"It is important to take a strategic approach to managing potential sites because of the limited number of sites suitable for large reactors in England and Wales,\" Middleton said.",
            "Last November, the UK government announced plans to invest at least £250 million ($352 million) over the next five years in a nuclear research and development program including a competition to identify the best value SMR design for the UK. The first phase of that competition, a call for initial expressions of interest, was launched in March. It has also announced that an SMR Delivery Roadmap will be published later this year.",
            "The ETI is a public-private partnership between global energy and engineering companies and the UK government, mandated with accelerating the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies in the UK."

CNL made the decision not to include intermediate-level waste after reviewing comments and concerns expressed during a public comment period on the facility's draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).",
            "The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) completed its technical assessment of the draft EIS for the facility in August. A consolidated table of federal comments, including the CNSC's assessment and those of other federal authorities participating in the review, was submitted back to CNL for action. This table included a number of comments and concerns related to the inclusion of intermediate-level waste in the facility, the CNSC said. Similar comments were also raised in submissions received during the public comment period on the EIS, it added.",
            "CNL must address all federal and public comments received on the proposal before submitting its final EIS.",
            "The NSDF has previously been described by CNL as a crucial step in the transformation of the Chalk River Laboratories site into a centre for world class science and technology innovation following the closure of the National Research Universal reactor next year after 60 years of operations. Revitalisation of the Chalk River Laboratories will involve the decommissioning of more than 100 buildings that have reached the end of their useful lives. CNL earlier this year published a long-term strategy for the Ontario site which includes infrastructure investments of more than CAD1.2 billion ($873 million) over 10 years for the development of a new small modular reactor at the site by 2026.",
            "The facility, an engineered containment mound able to hold 1 million cubic metres of waste, was initially intended to safely dispose of solid, low-level radioactive waste and a small amount of intermediate-level waste from Chalk River, including waste from demolition activities and operational waste currently in interim storage. It would also contain small quantities of waste from decommissioning projects at other governmental sites and from Canadian hospitals, universities and industrial clients.",
            "CNL announced that it had \"re-evaluated\" its proposal for the NSDF in a Community Information Bulletin dated 27 October, in which it said waste intended for disposal in the facility will meet International Atomic Energy Agency guidelines for low-level radioactive waste.",
            "\"Intermediate level waste will continue to be managed in interim storage at Chalk River Laboratories until a long-term disposal solution for this category of radioactive waste has been developed and approved,\" it said.",
            "The CNSC today said the environmental assessment process will continue, taking into account CNL's revised proposal. The regulator said it is awaiting documentation from CNL that details the revised waste inventory being proposed. This, along with CNL's responses to all federal, provincial and public comments, will be considered as part of the CNSC's ongoing environmental assessment review of the proposed project, it said."

            "This may be a \"watershed\" year for the US nuclear industry, which must maintain a strong domestic sector by keeping its reactors operating but must also demonstrate it can build new plants, while paving the way for advanced reactors, the Nuclear Energy Institute's (NEI) John Kotek told the US Energy Association's State of the Energy Forum on 18 January.",
            "NEI's John Kotek addresses the State of the Energy Industry Forum (Image: NEI)",
            "\"It is critical that we maintain a strong domestic nuclear sector; this begins by keeping our existing plants operating,\" the NEI's vice-president for policy development and public affairs told the Forum. Much of the action to preserve existing plants will take place at the state level, he said. New York, Illinois and Connecticut have \"shown the way\", and other states need to follow. \"We're encouraged by the states' recognition of the need to keep nuclear plants open, whether for emissions reduction or energy diversity,\" he said.",
            "A failure to value appropriately all the benefits of nuclear power has contributed to an uneven playing field that is forcing nuclear plants to close prematurely, he said. The decision by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to terminate proceedings on Energy Secretary Rick Perry's proposed rulemaking on grid resilience and reliability provoked an important conversation about the role of nuclear plants in ensuring a resilient, reliable grid, he said.",
            "Perry's proposed rulemaking, submitted to FERC in September last year, would have specifically recognised the attributes of generation sources able to store fuel on site. The regulator announced its decision on 8 January, after receiving over 1500 submissions on the proposed rule. Instead, it has launched a new proceeding to address resilience in a broader context. At the time, NEI President and CEO Maria Korsnick said the organisation was disappointed that FERC had not taken affirmative action that would preserve the nation's nuclear power plants, but praised Perry's efforts to place the issue on the national agenda.",
            "Kotek said the nuclear industry must demonstrate that it can build and complete nuclear plants. He said the decision to proceed with the nuclear construction project at Vogtle in Georgia was significant, offering an opportunity for the US nuclear sector to show it can \"successfully\" build new reactors.",
            "The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission's recent conclusion that NuScale Power's small modular reactor design can operate safely without the need for so-called 1E electrical power supplies - a key aspect of the design - was a positive development. He said NRC's approval offered a \"new paradigm for regulatory efficiency\".",

Nuclear submarines use highly enriched uranium (HEU).",
            "Used nuclear fuel retains much of its fissile content, and the project would aim to demonstrate the blending down of used HEU fuel from the USA's naval programme to produce useable HALEU. Such a project could potentially reduce the amounts of nuclear waste from the naval programme requiring disposal.",

A site at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has been earmarked for the construction of a NuScale small modular reactor. The INL has also been identified as a possible site for Terrestrial Energy's Integral Molten Salt Reactor.",
            "Current operating naval reactors have the potential to create a total of 100,000 tons of used nuclear fuel, for which disposal will cost about USD100 billion, Crapo told the Senate on 20 June. Advanced nuclear reactors could potentially reuse this and to reduce the overall disposal cost, he said.",
            "\"HEU repurposing, from materials like spent naval fuel, can be done using hybrid processes that use advanced dry head-end technologies followed by material recovery, which creates the fuel for our new advanced reactors. Repurposing this spent fuel has the potential of reducing waste that would otherwise be disposed of at taxpayer expense, and approximately 1 metric ton of HEU can create 4 useable tons for our new reactors,\" Crapo told the Senate.",
            "\"By reusing spent fuel to power advanced reactors, we can supply the inputs necessary for critical research initiatives, such as those at the INL, and provide a cost-saving and environmental service by reducing the amount of spent waste otherwise stored or cleaned up,\" Crapo said after the vote.",

            "\"The progress of the strategic contract is important for the sector,\" said de Rugy. \"This contract will give it the necessary visibility to face the challenges of multi-year energy programming that will achieve a 50% share of electricity in the mix in 2035.\"",
            "President Emmanuel Macron announced last November that a total of 14 French power reactors of 900 MWe capacity will be shut down in order to reduce the share of nuclear in the country's electricity generation mix from the current 75% to 50% by 2035.",
            "The 2012 election pledge by former French president Francois Hollande aimed to limit nuclear's share of French generation to 50% by 2025, and to close Fessenheim - the country's oldest plant - by the end of his five-year term, which ended in May last year. In June 2014, following a national energy debate, his government announced the country's nuclear generating capacity would be capped at the current level of 63.2 GWe. It would also be limited to 50% of France's total output by 2025. The French Energy Transition for Green Growth Law was adopted in August 2015.",
            "When he was elected, Macron promised to respect Hollande's target. However, he has said French reductions in nuclear power must be at a pace which allows the country to retain energy sovereignty.",

            "Investigations into the properties of molten salts, progress towards the construction of a Versatile Test Reactor and the return to service of Idaho National Laboratory's Transient Reactor Test Facility also featured in Brouillette's list, as did efforts to provide pathways to the High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel that future advanced reactors will require. The DOE was \"looking into multiple options\" to provide small amounts of HALEU in the near-term to support the testing and demonstration of these technologies by recycling excess US government nuclear fuel.",

China also has 11 units under construction with an installed capacity of about 12 GWe, ranking the country first in the world in that respect, he said. In 2018, nuclear power generated 287 TWh of electricity in China, accounting for 4.2% of national power generation, and Gu is \"fully confident\" that China will add a further 6-8 units each year over the next 10 years.",

In some countries, clean energy takes about 60% of the energy mix. However, we think that hydropower is highly restricted by regional resources, and wind and solar power also have natural constraints. They can hardly be the main power producers without a breakthrough in energy storage technology. Also, nuclear power has been demonstrated as an important option in replacing coal-fired power plants on a large scale. Nuclear power is an important baseload option to avoid price fluctuation and the grid risk from renewable energy.\"",

They can power everything from military bases to remote villages and islands beset by tropical storms and hurricanes.\"",
            "For the countries of Europe and the USA, SMRs and other advanced reactors, in providing a boost for nuclear energy, will also enhance energy reliability and security. Energy secure means economically secure, while energy security also bolsters national security, Perry said.",

            "The potential benefits of SMRs include their lower financial risks, enhanced safety including passive or inherent safety features, reduced risk of core damage and reduced core size, and greater siting flexibility than large-scale plants, Cañete said. However, the deployment of SMRs faces challenges from: the need for regulatory scrutiny of their safety and security features; the risk of physical protection for non-proliferation purposes; and a need for the deployment of SMR technology to be done in a \"safe and transparent\" way with cooperation and dialogue between industry, utilities, member states, civil society and the European Commission.",
            "International collaboration in the development of new and innovative nuclear technologies is necessary and should include areas such as licensing and safety, Cañete said.

Twelve modules, each producing 50 MW, are submerged in a safety-related pool built below ground level. The NRC has concluded the design's passive features \"will ensure the nuclear power plant would shut down safely and remain safe under emergency conditions, if necessary\", it said. NuScale has also indicated to NRC it will apply for standard design approval of a version using 60 MW modules, the regulator said. This would require additional NRC review.",
            "Design certification means the NRC has, after thorough examination of compliance with safety requirements, approved a nuclear power plant design independent of an application to construct or operate a plant. Full certification allows a utility to reference the design when applying for a combined licence to build and operate a nuclear power plant anywhere in the USA, although site-specific licensing procedures must still be completed and a combined construction and operating licence obtained before construction can begin. Design certification is valid for 15 years from the date of issuance, but can be renewed for an additional 10 to 15 years.",

            "Nuclear could be \"more than just zero-carbon, reliable, dispatchable power\" but must be at the right price, he said. The high capex and overnight costs of current nuclear builds make it very difficult for private companies to support such projects on their balance sheet, Wileman said.",
            "\"What if you could build a small modular reactor of 300 MW for USD1 billion or less?\" he asked. \"What if you could build a nuclear plant where the possibility of a large LOCA [loss of coolant accident] was totally eliminated? Imagine all the safety equipment in today's designs, that wouldn't be required for the safe operation of that plant. What if you could figure out how to take advantage of those and simplify a plant such that it requires 90% less safety-related concrete and 50% less concrete per MW?\"",
            "This is the approach GE-Hitachi has taken in designing the BWRX-300, which Wileman described as a \"design-to-cost\" exercise. BWRX-300 is based on the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission-certified 1,520 MWe Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) design.",
            "\"We're not stand-alone - we are in an ecosystem of electricity generation,\" he said. \"We've taken a lot of this work and we've simplified things - the advanced concrete and construction techniques - and we're also moving back away from nuclear-specific design and going to catalogue items, and leveraging a lot of the supply chain that we've already got instead of having to stand up a new one, as well as using already existing and operating fuel designs, which are already in use in over 70% of the BWRs around the world.\"",
            "According to material published by GE-Hitachi, the ESBWR has about 160,000 cubic metres of safety-related concrete while the BWRX-300 has only 15,500 cubic metres.  Most of the nuclear-related technology and components used in the plant either have had many years of proven operation experience or have undergone significant testing and licensing as part of the ESBWR programme, while advanced concrete solutions and innovative techniques incorporated in the design have been proved in the oil and gas, tunnelling and power industries.",
            "The flexibility of SMRs also means they will be able to support a variety of activities beyond electricity generation, providing cost-competitive and environmentally friendly power for uses such as hydrogen production, desalination, district heating and industrial use, Wileman said, highlighting GE-Hitachi's ongoing discussions with Polish manufacturer Synthos on using the BWRX-300 to meet that company's electricity needs.",
            "GE-Hitachi is on track to bring BWRX-300 to the market by 2028, Wileman said, adding: \"I really am excited about moving from 'What if?', to really getting it done\"",

            "Framatome and General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems (GA-EMS) are to collaborate on the development of a new helium-cooled, 50 MWe fast modular reactor (FMR). A demonstration of the reactor could be constructed by 2030, with commercialisation of the design by the mid-2030s.",
            "The FMR will be designed for enhanced safety and ease of operation with fast-response load following and overall high efficiency, General Atomics said. The passively safe gas-cooled FMR will use a non-hazardous helium coolant - a chemically-inert gas that is non-explosive, non-corrosive and does not become activated. Because the reactor is dry-cooled and uses virtually no water to operate, it can be sited nearly anywhere, it said. The power conversion forgoes the use of complex steam generators and pressurisers, and the fuel will operate for approximately nine years before requiring replacement.",
            "The direct helium Brayton cycle enables fast grid response, with up to a 20% per minute power ramping rate for load following, and high overall efficiency of 45% during normal operation. The automatic control of the reactor power and turbomachinery keep the reactor at a constant temperature that mitigates thermal cycle fatigue associated with most load-following reactors.",
            "Due to its advanced modular design, the FMR reactor can be built in a factory and assembled on-site, which helps to reduce capital costs and enables incremental capacity additions.",
            "Framatome's US engineering team will be responsible for designing several critical structures, systems and components for the FMR.",
            "\"This collaboration builds on our long relationship with General Atomics with a shared interest in advancing nuclear energy technologies to create a cleaner world for generations to come,\" said Framatome CEO Bernard Fontana. \"With our experience and expertise in designing reactor systems and components for advanced and small modular reactors, our team is helping to make that vision a reality.\"",
            "\"Designing and deploying a safe, cost-effective, modular reactor is critical in helping the world move closer towards a clean energy future,\" said GA-EMS President Scott Forney. \"We look forward to leveraging our two companies' decades of experience in advancing nuclear technology and demonstrating the next generation of commercially viable nuclear reactors.\"",
            "Christina Back, vice president of nuclear technologies and materials at GA-EMS, added: \"For a clean energy future, GA-EMS is bringing together the team and technologies to realise a community-friendly, advanced nuclear plant that works seamlessly with renewables.\" She said there is strong interest across the industry in the future commercialisation of the FMR. \"Our design will employ technologies for safe and reliable operation that can be sited virtually anywhere to expand distributed electricity generation.\"",
            "The GA-EMS led team aims to complete a demonstration of the FMR - which will verify the design, manufacturing, construction and operation of the technology - in the early 2030s. Commercial deployment is anticipated by the mid-2030s.",
            "General Atomics has also been developing its Energy Multiplier Module (EM2) small modular reactor design. This is a modified version of its Gas-Turbine Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR) design. The EM2 employs a 500 MWt, 265 MWe helium-cooled fast-neutron high-temperature reactor operating at 850 degrees Celsius. This would be factory manufactured and transported to the plant site by truck. It is designed to operate for 30 years without requiring refuelling.",
            "\"The FMR is a new design separate from the EM2,\" Back told",
            ". \"There are commonalities with the use of direct Brayton cycle for higher thermal efficiency as well as the fast neutron spectrum of the reactor core, but those are the only main commonalties.",
            "\"Some of the FMR’s key systems and fuel are quite different from EM2 and are specifically designed for the smaller sized FMR and for meeting the demonstration and deployment timeframes. We see the FMR as a nearer-term offering that can meet the power market needs of the mid-2030s,\" she said. \"Having said that, we are still pursuing longer-term demonstration and deployment of the larger base-load EM2 power plant.\"",

The government has already committed to removing coal from the electricity mix no later than 2025 and perhaps as early as 2024. Retiring capacity will need to be replaced to keep pace with existing levels of demand, but this could double out to 2050, the government said. As a result, electricity could provide more than half of final energy demand by then, up from 17% in 2019.",
            "\"While we are not planning for any specific technology solution, we can discern some key characteristics of the future generation mix,\" the White Paper says. \"A low-cost, net zero consistent system is likely to be composed predominantly of wind and solar. But ensuring the system is also reliable, means intermittent renewables need to be complemented by technologies which provide power, or reduce demand, when the wind is not blowing, or the sun does not shine. Today this includes nuclear, gas with carbon capture and storage, and flexibility provided by batteries, demand side response, interconnectors and short-term dispatchable generation providing peaking capacity, which can be flexed as required.\"",
            "The government targets 40 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030, will support the deployment of at least one power carbon capture utilisation and storage project by that date, and will aim to bring at least one large-scale nuclear project to the point of Final Investment Decision (FID) by the end of this Parliament, in 2024.",
            "\"We will remain open to further projects later if the nuclear industry demonstrates that it is able to reduce costs and deliver to time and budget,\" the White Paper says. \"We expect the sector to deliver the goal it set itself in our Nuclear Sector Deal, published in 2018, to reduce the cost of nuclear new build by 30% by 2030,\" it adds.",

In considering the financing options, we will examine the potential role of government finance during construction, provided there is clear value for money for consumers and taxpayers.\"",

The remaining GBP170 million will go to a research and development programme for advanced modular reactors (AMR).",

The onus is on the company developing to project to bring as many people as possible with them. You're not going to get a 100% of people, and I'm realistic about that, but if you can get a big majority and can show that you are benefitting the local community, that you're sensitive to their environmental concerns.

We have to figure out the best financial package, in terms of how it's structured, the ownership, the balance between debt and equity, whether the government - and it's something that's on the table still - puts taxpayers' money as a form of equity.",
            "It is very difficult, he said to \"see anything better than nuclear power\" in terms of low-carbon and dispatchable firm power, which will be a key part of the UK's energy system in 2050.",

            "gears up for next 40 years",
            "The business case behind the decision to restart the USA's only domestic uranium conversion facility announced earlier this year rested on suitable answers to several \"puzzle piece\" questions falling into place, ConverDyn's Malcolm Critchley told the World Nuclear Fuel Cycle forum yesterday.",
            "Puzzle pieces needed to come together for MTW restart (Image: Converdyn)",
            "Price had not been the only reason behind Honeywell's November 2017 decision to place its Metropolis Works (MTW) plant, which is in Illinois, on \"idle standby\", Critchley said. An \"alarming\" picture of the nature of conversion supply was at that time beginning to emerge, with a significant overhang of secondary supplies making a temporary shutdown the best option.",
            "It will cost about USD150 million to restart the plant, Critchley said, so a solid business case was needed to justify the plant's restart. This hinged on multiple pieces coming together: market demand; the outcome of the US Administration's Nuclear Fuel Working Group (NFWG); contracted sales; the status of the US-Russian Suspension Agreement; and the MTW plant itself. The business case constructed by the company addressed each of these pieces in turn.",
            "Recent experiences suggest that Converdyn's action in idling the plant had contributed to a transformation in market fundamentals since 2017. Analysis of market forecasts post-2020 suggest that if MTW was not to restart, a shortfall averaging about 11,500 tonnes per year could emerge. These analyses show that the output of the plant is needed, he said.",
            "The outcome of the NFWG - given large US government inventories of uranium tails and high-enriched uranium - could have been a significant barrier to restarting the plant, he said. Indications over the last year or so from Congress have changed significantly, with \"genuine\" cross-party support for the nuclear supply chain which seems to have survived the change in the US administration and the recognition of uranium as a critical mineral.",
            "The decision to set up a US domestic uranium reserve and support for high-assay low-enriched uranium programmes to support small modular reactor and defence needs demonstrates the start of \"joined-up thinking\" in this area, he said, but just as importantly, he said, sales of US government inventory are not seen as being likely, in the current political environment, for the \"foreseeable future\".",
            "Critchley turned to sales as the next piece in the puzzle. A reduction in long-term contracting in 2016-17, and the \"natural reluctance\" of customers to enter into long-term contracts with Converdyn, had positioned the company \"perilously close to cliff edge\", he said. During 2020 it had approached its customers to solicit new business to support restart - a \"huge ask\" for utilities facing challenges from many directions.",
            "\"Suffice it to say, our customers provided sufficient support to justify MTW restart. In the end, the majority of customers shared view that on balance, a restart was the right thing to do,\" he said.",
            "The October 2020 agreement by the US Department of Commerce and Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom have to extend the",
            "Agreement Suspending the Antidumping Investigation on Uranium from the Russian Federation",
            ", to 2040, formed another piece of the puzzle. Had the extension not been agreed, this could have been a \"death knell\" for MTW.",
            "The final piece of the puzzle is MTW itself. The plant received a renewed licence from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2020. In the past, he said, such licences had only been valid for 10 years - and this could have in itself proved a deal-breaker for long-term operations, when considering contracts with a payback period of longer than 10 years. The new licence is valid for 40 years, which removes that uncertainty.",
            "The \"sensible objective\" is to plan to operate for the plant for the 40-year life of the licence, but this has also meant an increased number of projects must be completed before the plant can restart. In addition, the company is carrying out safety upgrades over and above those required by the regulator to satisfy Honeywell's own safety requirements. These measures mean increased upfront costs - but a better long-term payback, he said.",
            "Honeywell has drawn up a restart plan targeting a production restart in 2023, which Critchley described as an \"aggressive\" timeline.",
            "With the exception of customer support, which stands out as a very positive contribution to our analysis, the startup justification can be characterised by the removal of a lot of risk and negative assumptions that all came together to allow us to build a positive case.",
            "Metropolis was built in the 1950s to meet military conversion requirements, and began providing UF6 for civilian use in the late 1960s. The plant's output is exclusively marketed by ConverDyn.",

            "Orano Conversion & Enrichment CEO Jacques Peythieu",
            "Jacques Peythieu, Chief Executive Officer of Orano Conversion & Enrichment, discusses the company's recovery from the impacts of the pandemic and industrial action, 2020 results, production ramp up at its Philippe Coste plant in France, and possible transformation of the conversion market due to the recently announced restart of Honeywell's conversion plant at Metropolis in the USA. He also assesses the prospects of enrichment market and the expected requirements for HALEU (high-assay low-enriched uranium), as well as potential hurdles to supply capabilities or to transportation of this material. A multinational nuclear fuel cycle company headquartered in Hauts-de-Seine, France, Orano has an order book worth EUR26 billion (USD31 billion).",
            "Jacques Peythieu (Image: Orano)",
            "How has Orano managed the disruption caused by COVID-19 and what are the lessons learned from the strikes at the Malvési conversion plant?",
            "Given the situation in Wuhan we decided as soon as January 2020 to revisit our activity continuity plan, that had been set to face unexpected events, around three domains: preserve the health of people working on our sites; keep a high level of nuclear safety; and ensure the continuity of all essential activities required for the production of electricity in France and abroad. This crisis is not over yet and stepping back from this specific event I am convinced that being prepared to manage low-probability risks with high consequences is a must today.",
            "Facing a combination of industrial adjustments in ramping-up Philippe Coste production and of local social tension in Malvési, the 2020 production level was limited to 2640 tonnes of UF6. The Philippe Coste conversion plant runs according to plan this year, with a monthly production exceeding 1000 tU, and I feel confident that Philippe Coste can achieve production above 8000 tonnes this year.",
            "What is the timeline for ramping up the Philippe Coste plant and what is the breakdown of capacity during and at the end of that period?",
            "The project phase is over now and production is gradually increasing to reach the nameplate capacity of 15,000 tonnes in 2023.",
            "What was the thinking behind the restart of the conversion plant in the USA and what will it mean for the global conversion market? Do you expect any changes in utilities' buying behaviour after the conversion market becomes re-balanced again in 2023-2024?",
            "I am not going to comment on the decision of one of our competitors but I can say that, despite this restart, conversion supply and demand are fairly balanced. During the Philippe Coste ramp-up, I have learnt that conversion is the most complicated facility of the front-end fuel cycle and even with undisputable operating experience it is not an easy matter to start up such a facility.",
            "What are the key trends in supply/demand for U3O8, UF6 and EUP (enriched uranium product)?",
            "Looking ahead across all front-end businesses, there is positive news. In the long term, worldwide electricity demand is to double by 2050 whilst carbon emissions need a twofold reduction. This factor is a real challenge, and nuclear energy is year after year better recognised to fill a significant part of this gap. Whatever the type of reactors which will be developed and built, this will have an impact on front-end demand for U308, UF6 and EUP. By way of example, how should uranium producers dedicate the necessary exploration budget to pave the way to additional resources given the current market environment? I am proud to say that Orano has dedicated the highest exploration budget among all players over the past years.",
            "The challenge for enrichers is also a financial one. Enrichers do face the combination of capacity replacement of ageing centrifuges, the overall generation capacity increase and the additional efforts needed to produce HALEU. Clearly the investments in new cascades and centrifuges will not happen at a time when market prices do not sustain additional investments.",
            "What are your plans and expectations for supplies of HALEU in light of accident tolerant fuels and new fuels for SMRs that are rapidly developing nowadays? Where are the constraints to transportation and delivery, regionally and globally? Do you see any challenges in the regulatory regimes?",
            "We are currently focusing on producing uranium enriched up to 6% by the end of 2023 and higher assays will follow. With our logistics subsidiary, Orano TN, we are working actively to unlock the current constraints of transportation for deliveries. This topic is common to all the industry. Regarding production plans for HALEU up to 20%, interest from small modular reactor developers is flourishing. Building the HALEU supply chain is a project on its own. Therefore, the industry needs to work together with all stakeholders to establish a sustainable business model in order to allow the decision by front-end suppliers to invest. If so, Orano has the technical capability and is ready to invest.",
            "I have full confidence in our industry's ability to build the solutions for the nuclear of the 21st Century.",
            "What does nuclear energy's role in the clean energy transition mean for the conversion and enrichment market?",
            "As mentioned previously, the increase in electricity production to fight climate change will be tremendous. But you need to produce decarbonised electricity. France produces six times less CO2 per kilowatt-hour than Germany. Nuclear will play a key role in this regard. At Orano, we are very confident in the development of nuclear and for this reason we are also positive for all the front-end business (uranium, conversion and enrichment). When I look at the market price of these three components, I conclude that now all suppliers and customers share the same common view that post-Fukushima adjustment is behind us and that a new trend has started."

Synthos, which has exclusive rights in the country for GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's (GEH's) small nuclear reactors, will participate in the project as both an investor and the technology provider.",
            "The Pątnów I coal-fired power plant (Image: ZE PAK)",
            "Under the agreement, the companies intend to cooperate by establishing a joint venture to carry out activities in the field of nuclear energy, in particular the construction of power generation units based on GEH's BWRX-300 reactor, or \"other optimal American SMR technologies\". The planned investment in SMR units will be located at the Pątnów plant site, which has been generating electricity from lignite from a nearby opencast mine for several decades. Last year, ZE PAK announced its exit from coal-fired power generation by 2030.",
            "ZE PAK is owned by Zygmunt Solorz, one of the largest private investors in Poland, while Synthos is owned by Michał Sołowow, owner of the largest private industrial group in Central and Eastern Europe.",
            "\"For several years I have been betting on clean and zero-carbon energy,\" Solorz said. \"Solar, wind, hydrogen and nuclear are the most important energy sources we are investing in. PAK is the first coal-fired power producer in Poland that not only says it has a plan to move away from coal, but is actually moving away from it ... Investment in the atom is a gigantic opportunity for Poland, its people and businesses to access clean and cheap energy. Poland needs diverse, ecological sources of electricity and heat, both for all individual and corporate consumers.\"",
            "He added, \"Poland is the manufacturing hub of Europe, which requires emission-free and stable sources of energy. If we want to continue developing at a fast pace and become a more affluent society, and attract further foreign investment to us, we must have access to attractively priced energy.\"",
            "ZE PAK CEO Piotr Woźny noted that the Pątnów site is also listed as a potential site for large nuclear power reactors in the government's Polish Nuclear Power Programme. \"Our plans are not in competition with those of the state,\" he said. \"SMRs will not replace the state's large-scale power generation, but they may be an excellent supplement to it and gradually replace some of the power generated from fossil fuels, and in the near future they may help compensate for the lack of available capacity in the power system, resulting from the decommissioning of subsequent coal-fired units and increasing demand for electricity.\"",
            "GEH said: \"We applaud this announcement and fully support the vision to replace coal with carbon-free nuclear generation. We agree that the BWRX-300 small modular reactor is ideally suited for this application and we look forward to broadening our partnership with Synthos Green Energy to help Poland achieve its decarbonisation goals.\"",

The BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems, based on GEH's US-licensed, 1520 MWe Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor design. Synthos in October last year began a regulatory dialogue with the Polish National Atomic Energy Agency on the possibility of building the BWRX-300 in Poland, with the support of US utility Exelon Generation, GEH and Finland's Fortum Power and Heat Oy.",
            "Synthos announced in December 2020 the completion of a deployment feasibility study for the implementation of a fleet of GEH BWRX-300 SMRs in Poland. The study, which was prepared by Exelon, covers the analysis of key aspects of SMR technology implementation, including cost issues, personnel policy, regulatory and security issues, construction models and operational issues.",
            "In November 2020, Synthos also signed a cooperation agreement with Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC), which is developing the high-temperature gas-cooled Micro Modular Reactor, or MMR. USNC and Synthos jointly applied to the Polish Ministry of Development for financing from the IPCEI mechanism (Important Projects of Common European Interest) for projects within the scope of the value chain of hydrogen technologies and systems.

            "Nuclear energy offers a \"golden opportunity\" to create a cleaner and more equitable world, World Nuclear Association Director General Sama Bilbao y León said today at the",
            "in Paris. However, she noted there are three major challenges hindering the nuclear industry in making its full potential contribution towards sustainable development and combatting climate change: financing, perception and regulation.",
            "Sama Bilbao y León speaking at the World Nuclear Exhibition (Image: Nathan Paterson/World Nuclear Association)",
            "Bilbao y León said about 440 nuclear power reactors are \"quietly operating in the background - out of sight and out of mind - providing people across the world with always-on, inexpensive, non-polluting and reliable energy.\"",
            "She added that, so far this year, over 5 GW of new nuclear generating capacity has been brought online across the world, in China, India, Pakistan and the UAE. Meanwhile, construction has started on a further 6 GW of capacity. \"The nuclear sector is gathering quite a bit of momentum,\" she said.",
            "Extending the life of the current fleet of reactors as long as feasible is vitally important, she said. \"We have seen positive movement on this front, particularly in the USA, where nearly 20 reactors have been saved from needless premature closure in the last five years - closures that would not only increase greenhouse gas emissions, but also undermine energy independence and result in lethal air pollution ... and leave behind many communities whose economy depends on these units.\"",
            "Meeting the 1.5°C temperature rise target in a cost-effective and socially equitable manner will require the rapid deployment of much more nuclear energy, Bilbao y León said. \"Nuclear power enables rapid decarbonisation on a massive scale, and it has the track record to prove it.\"",
            "\"Nuclear technologies will play a major role in making possible a net-zero world of abundant energy for everyone, generating electricity for large grids and small communities alike, providing district heating and cooling, supplying process heat to industry, producing hydrogen, and so much more,\" she said. \"Because nuclear energy is the only energy source that can produce low-carbon electricity",
            "low-carbon heat, it can be a game changer for the deep decarbonisation of the entire global economy.\"",
            "For nuclear energy to play a significant role to meet the decarbonisation and sustainable development needs of the world, more than 1200 GWe of nuclear generation must be installed by 2050. This means the construction of 30 new reactors annually. \"We can do it,\" Bilbao y León said. \"We have done this before, but we have not yet reached that level today.\"",
            "She said the nuclear industry urgently needs to lay down the human, physical, commercial and institutional infrastructures that will enable it to \"truly scale up fast to meet the urgent and massive decarbonisation needs.",
            "\"Going further yet, we need to accelerate the development and deployment of small modular reactor (SMRs) and advanced nuclear technologies. SMRs and advanced nuclear projects will play an important role in further diversifying the nuclear sector, and bringing nuclear to new markets and applications.\"",
            "However, Bilbao y León said the nuclear industry must \"build on the momentum of today to remove the remaining barriers that nuclear energy faces.\" These, she said, are financing, perception and regulation.",
            "With regards to financing, she said it is essential the industry ensure nuclear power projects are included in the various ESG (environment, social and governance) finance frameworks and sustainable finance taxonomies being developed across the world.",
            "\"The global nuclear sector needs to continue to work towards ensuring that all these green financing classifications and frameworks - which will be used to build a more sustainable tomorrow - are based on scientific and technology-neutral methodologies.\"",
            "She said it is also imperative to develop financial, contractual and market approaches that help align the characteristics of a nuclear project with the needs and priorities of private investors. \"Indeed, nuclear power should be a natural choice for any investor with a long-term horizon, such as pension funds.\"",
            "There has been growing recognition amongst policy makers and the public of the low-carbon attributes and high reliability of nuclear power, Bilbao y León noted. \"But let's be clear on this: recognition is not enough. We don't want nuclear energy to be the option of last resort ... we want it to be the first choice.",
            "\"Beyond achieving decarbonisation in high-income countries, there are so many powerful stories that the nuclear community should tell, stories that will be incredibly powerful in changing public perception towards nuclear technologies. Such as painting the picture of a world in which the economies of today's developing countries thrive thanks to a reliable supply of abundant, clean and cheap electricity.\"",
            "On the issue of regulation, she said the industry urgently needs to address the licensing of reactor designs across national borders. \"There can be no doubt that the nuclear industry is being held back by national approaches to licensing and regulation, turning what should be an efficient series of nth-of-a-kind projects with significant learning curves, into a never-ending series of first-of-a-kind ones, with its many - and well-known - drawbacks,\" Bilbao y León said. \"This creates unnecessary uncertainty and risk to the deployment of new reactors.",
            "\"The world has changed, and we must change with it ... Now more than ever it is essential for industry, regulators and governments to work together to align national regulatory approaches and streamline the international licensing process.\"",
            "She said the future for nuclear power has \"not looked brighter in many years, but it is up to us to capitalise on the current momentum and make the absolute most of this opportunity. Game on for nuclear!\"",

            "Ontario Power Generation (OPG) has selected the BWRX-300 small modular reactor (SMR) for the Darlington new nuclear site, and will work with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) to deploy the reactor. Canada's first commercial, grid-scale, SMR could be completed as early as 2028.",
            "The Darlington site, next to OPG's operating CANDU reactors, is the only site currently licensed in Canada for new nuclear (Image: OPG)",
            "OPG and GEH will collaborate on SMR engineering, design, planning, preparing licensing and permitting materials, and site preparation activities. Site preparation will begin in the spring of 2022, pending appropriate approvals, OPG said. It aims to apply to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) for a construction licence by the end of next year.",
            "Darlington is the only site in Canada currently licensed for new nuclear: OPG was granted a site preparation licence by the CNSC in 2012, after completion of an environmental assessment which included public involvement, but reductions in forecast electricity demand led to a decision to defer plans for new build. OPG last year announced it was resuming planning activities for additional nuclear power generation via an SMR at the site, rather than a large conventional reactor, as previously envisaged. The CNSC recently granted a 10-year renewal to the site preparation licence, which had been due to expire in August 2022.",
            "\"We know nuclear is a key proven zero-emissions baseload energy source that will help us achieve net-zero as a company by 2040, and act as a catalyst for efficient economy-wide decarbonisation by 2050,\" OPG President and CEO Ken Hartwick said. \"By moving forward, with our industry-leading technology partner GE Hitachi, on deployment of innovative technology for an SMR at Darlington, OPG is paving the way on the development and deployment of the next generation of nuclear power in Canada and beyond.\"",
            "The BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems that leverages the design and licensing basis of GEH's ESBWR boiling water reactor, which has been certified by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It is currently undergoing a Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission pre-licensing Vendor Design Review, or VDR. As well as the BWRX-300, OPG had also been considering Terrestrial Energy's Integrated Molten Salt Reactor and X-energy's Xe-100 high-temperature gas-cooled reactor for deployment at Darlington.",
            "A 2020 study by the Conference Board of Canada found that a 300 MWe grid-scale SMR built in Ontario and operated for 60 years would create thousands of direct and indirect jobs from project development through to decommissioning. An independent report by PwC Canada, commissioned by GEH, has estimated that the construction and operation of the first BWRX-300 in Ontario will generate CAD2.3 billion (USD1.8 billion) in GDP, CAD1.9 billion in labour income and more than CAD750 million in federal, provincial and municipal tax revenue over its lifespan, with each subsequent BWRX-300 deployed in Ontario and other provinces is expected to further generate more than CAD1.1 billion in GDP and more than CAD300 million in tax revenue.",
            "\"OPG is Ontario's climate change leader and is positioned to become a world leader in SMRs. Together, this partnership will bring jobs and economic benefits to Durham Region, Ontario and Canada, and potential global export of this technology,\" GEH President and CEO Jay Wileman said.",
            "\"This first-of-a-kind reactor represents the future of nuclear power, not only in Canada, but across the world,\" Heather Chalmers, president and CEO of GE Canada, said during the livestreamed announcement. \"By making this decision, OPG and Ontario are demonstrating a clear example of how Canada can lead in the global energy transition … Ontario and OPG are positioned to be the first mover in small modular reactor technology globally,\" she said.",
            "New nuclear technologies such as SMRs represent tremendous economic and environmental opportunities for Ontario and all of Canada, Ontario Minister of Energy Todd Smith said. SMRs can provide reliable and emission-free energy while creating jobs, economic growth and export opportunities, he added. \"Our opportunity to be a leader in this technology is right here, right now,\" he said.",

            "The US Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management (EM) is marking thirty years of cleanup work at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) site to ensure the protection and safety of the underlying Snake River Plain aquifer in compliance with state and federal regulations.",
            "The INL site is underlain by the Snake River Plain aquifer (Image: EM)",
            "The 890 square mile (2300 square kilometre) site, located on the ancestral lands of the Shoshone and Bannock Tribes in southeast Idaho, was established in 1949 to design, build and test nuclear reactors for land, sea and air applications. Fifty-two reactors - most of them first-of-a-kind - were built at the site, including the US Navy's first prototype nuclear propulsion plant and Experimental Breeder Reactor No 1, the first reactor used to produce a usable quantity of electricity from nuclear fission and now a registered National Historic Landmark open to the public.",
            "Four of those 52 reactors remain in operation today: the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), the ATR Critical Facility, the Neutron Radiography Reactor, and the Transient Reactor Test Facility. INL today is part of the DOE's complex of national laboratories, carrying out nuclear energy research and development, and the site has also been selected by NuScale Power and Utah Associated Municipal Power Systemsfor the deployment of a small modular reactor plant by the end of this decade.",
            "In December 1991, the DOE, the state of Idaho and the US Environmental Protection Agency signed a Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order outlining a plan to investigate and clean up, if necessary, more than 500 individual waste areas within the 890-square-mile site. The agreement provides the regulatory framework that is still in use for the cleanup of legacy wastes that include contamination from World War II- and Cold War-era conventional weapons testing, plus wastes from government-owned research and power-reactor development and testing, used nuclear fuel reprocessing, laboratory research, and defence missions at INL other government sites.",
            "Waste sites consisting of unlined wastewater disposal ponds, debris piles, radioactive groundwater plumes, buried barrels and boxes of radioactive and hazardous wastes, and even unexploded ordnance, have all been evaluated and most of the cleanup is complete, EM said.",
            "Two of the cleanup projects - the removal of 49,000 drums, of radioactive and hazardous waste from an unlined Cold War landfill known as the Subsurface Disposal Area, and the use of vacuum-extraction units to remove solvent vapours from beneath it - were specifically designed to protect the aquifer, which lies 585 feet (178 metres) below the landfill surface. The vacuum extraction project was completed early, and the waste removal is now expected to be completed 18 months ahead of schedule.",
            "Meanwhile, at the northern end of the INL site, more than 825 million gallons (over 3 million cubic metres) of water have been treated with a pump-and-treat system over the last 20 years, and bioremediation - by injecting sodium lactate or a similar product into a contaminant plume in the aquifer to create conditions favourable for naturally occurring microorganisms to \"feed\" on the waste - is ongoing.",
            "Construction of the 510,000-cubic-yard (390,000-cubic-metre) Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) Disposal Facility in the early 2000s has allowed waste material from many areas of the site to be consolidated into a single, managed landfill that includes several feet of impermeable liners as well as a leachate collection system and lined disposal ponds.",
            "Exhumation of buried waste from the areas of the landfill that pose the greatest risk to people and the environment, is expected to be completed within the coming weeks, EM said.",
            "\"The amount of environmental cleanup work that crews have completed is impressive,\" said Fred Hughes, programme manager for EM INL Site contractor Fluor Idaho. \"The progress is visible, and the aquifer is benefitting from a host of waste remediation projects.\"",

            "In July, the government laid out a new energy policy which aims to maintain nuclear's share of the country's energy mix at a minimum of 30% by 2030. It also calls for the construction of units 3 and 4 at the Shin Hanul nuclear power plant to resume after design work was suspended in 2017 due to uncertainties about government policy on the construction of new reactors. The new policy also aims to strengthen exports of new energy industries and \"capitalise on them as growth engines\". It sets the goal of exporting 10 nuclear power plants by 2030, as well as the development of a Korean small modular reactor design.",

            "found. The USA's current nuclear fleet has a combined capacity of 95 GWe.",
            "The report is underpinned by a study carried out by the Argonne, Idaho and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, sponsored by the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy. It is guided by three overarching questions: where in the USA are retired coal facilities located and what factors make a site feasible for transition; what factors of technology, cost, and project timeline drive investor economics over such a decision; and how will C2N impact local communities?",
            "The team screened recently retired and active coal plant sites to identify 157 retired and 237 operating coal plants sites as potential candidates for a C2N transition, which it further evaluated on parameters including population density, distance from seismic fault lines, flooding potential, and nearby wetlands, to determine if they could safely host a nuclear power plant. It found that 80% of the potential sites are suitable for hosting advanced nuclear power plants of varying size and type, depending on the size of the site being converted.",
            "The team then evaluated a case study of detailed impacts and potential outcomes from a C2N transition at a hypothetical site, considering various nuclear technology types for a range of scenarios including large light-water reactors, small modular reactors, sodium-cooled fast reactors and very high temperature reactors.",
            "At the regional level, replacing a large coal plant site with a nuclear power plant of equivalent size could provide some 650 jobs and USD275 million of economic activity, the report found. These jobs are spread across the plant, the supply chain supporting the plant, and the community surrounding the plant and most typically come with wages that are about 25% higher than any other energy technology. Nuclear power plant projects could also benefit from preserving the existing experienced workforce in communities around retiring coal plant sites, which already possess the necessary skills and knowledge that could be tranistioned to work at a nuclear power plant.",

Using existing land, grid connections, office buildings, electrical equipment such as transmission connections and switchyards, and civil infrastructure could also save millions of dollars upfront.",
            "Economic potential exists for owners of coal power plants - and the communities where they are located - from a C2N transition, the report concludes, with a potential further advantage for interested coal communities to be \"first movers\" in what the authors say could be a series of many C2N transitions across the USA. Although the study's findings inform only at a general level, the results could be used to set up more detailed, in-depth analyses to allow more accurate evaluations specific to a particular coal plant or nuclear technology design.",
            "The report was subjected to independent peer reviews by experts in systems engineering and regional economic modelling to evaluate analysis and assumptions.",
            "The possibility of replacing coal power plants with nuclear capacity is being actively explored in the USA and elsewhere. TerraPower in 2021 announced plans to build a demonstration unit of its Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor at a retired coal plant site in Wyoming; earlier this year, the the Maryland Energy Administration announced its support for work to evaluate the possibility of repurposing a coal-fired electric generating facility with X-energy’s Xe-100 small modular reactor; and Holtec International recently said it is considering coal plant sites as possible locations for its SMR-160 with plans to bring the first unit online as early as 2029. In Poland, NuScale is exploring with energy company Unimot and copper and silver producer KGHM possibilities for its reactors to replace coal-fired power plants.",

            "The Belledune Port Authority (BPA) wants to use advanced small modular reactor (SMR) technology as part of a future expansion at the port in northern New Brunswick, and says an ARC-100 providing energy for hydrogen production and other industries could be in operation by 2030-2035.",
            "ARC's vision of an ACR-100 plant (Image: ARC)",
            "The BPA has announced it is working with project development company Cross River Infrastructure Partners on the proposal to use ARC Clean Technology Canada's (ARC) reactor design to generate a minimum of 1GW of zero-emission firm heat and power for industrial users at the port's recently announced Green Energy Hub. The project could reach commercial operation between 2030 and 2035, subject to feasibility studies, environmental approvals and licensing from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, it said.",
            "The Green Energy Hub - a development district for clean energy projects, along with complementary, low-carbon industries to support regional economic growth - is a key piece of the BPA's long-term plans to transition away from declining traditional industries and toward a \"more dynamic\" and sustainable future. These were set out in its",
            "Master Development Plan 2022-2052",
            ", a 30-year roadmap published in October. BPA and Cross River have already agreed to develop a hydrogen facility powered by green-certified energy that would produce ammonia fuel for export, which is to be located at the Green Energy Hub.",
            "The SMR project would see the development of an ARC-100 unit to serve as an energy source for expanded hydrogen production and other industries based at the port, such as metal fabrication and advanced manufacturing. The ACR is an 100 MWe advanced sodium-cooled fast neutron SMR, which is based on the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II integral sodium-cooled fast reactor prototype which operated at the USA's Argonne National Laboratory from 1961 until 1994.",
            "\"One of the key advantages of the ARC reactors is their ability to provide a tremendous amount of high temperature steam and power in a small space,\" Cross River CEO Andrew Wilder said. \"As they are utilising proven technology, we believe the ARC-100 is the best advanced nuclear reactor to provide as an energy solution for heavy industry.\"",
            "The ARC-100 has also been selected for a demonstration project at NB Power's existing Point Lepreau nuclear power plant site as part of a joint strategic plan for SMR deployment set out earlier this year by the provincial governments of Ontario, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Alberta Canada’s SMR Roadmap. The demonstration unit is slated for commissioning by 2029, subject to approvals and licensing. The proposed project in Belledune would provide added scale for New Brunswick and could serve as a model for ARC's technology to be used as a direct energy source for industry, the partners said.",
            "\"The ARC-100 unit uses an inherently safe and proven technology with relatively low cost of modular construction and operation,\" ARC Canada CEO Bill Labbe said. \"It is an obvious choice for industrial implementation, and the Belledune application will make New Brunswick a leader in the development and deployment of small modular reactors in Canada and abroad.\"",
            "BPA President and CEO Denis Caron said the SMR would be part of a portfolio of clean energy projects at the Green Energy Hub, along with new wind energy developments, solar and biomass as well as leading edge energy storage solutions, and anticipated significant First Nations and community interest in the project. \"Maintaining and sustaining these relationships is critical to our collective success,\" he added.",
            "The proposed project is in traditional Mi’gmaq territory, and the Pabineau and Eel River Bar First Nations are adjacent to the Port of Belledune.",
            "\"With the need for a baseline source of clean energy it makes sense to go to small modular reactor technology,\" Chief Terry Richardson of Pabineau First Nation said. \"The fact that it can be utilised as a power source is a win for Cross River and other proponents developing hydrogen.\"",
            "Chief Sacha Labillois of Eel River Bar First Nation also welcomed the opportunity to learn more about about SMRs. \"Our community looks forward to engagement and consultation related to the environmental and economic benefits this development can bring to our region,\" he said.",
            "The BPA is part of Canada's Port Authority network. As well as managing the infrastructure and assets of the Port of Belledune, situated on the Atlantic coast in Northern New Brunswick. As well as four marine terminals, industrial-zoned land and infrastructure, the authority holds more than 650 hectares of land adjacent to its main terminal facilities that is available for immediate development. NB Power's 467 MWe baseload coal-fired plant at Belledune is expected to close by 2030 in line with Canadian federal plans to phase out coal.",

            "Estonia's Fermi Energia has selected GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's (GEH's) BWRX-300 small modular reactor (SMR) for potential deployment in the Baltic country by the early 2030s. Two other SMR designs had been under consideration.",
            "A rendering of a BWRX-300 plant (Image: GEH)",
            "In September 2022, Fermi Energia said it would accept tenders from three SMR developers: GE Hitachi, NuScale and Rolls-Royce. Bids with the comprehensive technical documentation needed to estimate the construction cost were expected by December. The company said in the selection of technology, the criteria were technological maturity, the establishment of a reference plant, economic competitiveness and the participation of Estonian companies in the supply chain.",
            "Fermi Energia has now announced the selection of GEH as the winning bidder, and said it will now sign a project development and preliminary works contract.",
            "GEH's BWRX-300 design is a 300 MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems that leverages the design and licensing basis of GEH's ESBWR boiling water reactor. It is currently undergoing a Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission pre-licensing Vendor Design Review and a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission pre-application design review.",
            "\"As the initial construction will start in Canada, Fermi Energia saw the reactor as the most suitable for construction in Estonia out of the three offers received,\" it said. \"Based on the design and construction experience of the Darlington nuclear power plant near Toronto, Ontario, the planning, design and construction of the Estonian nuclear power plant can also be gradually started.\"",
            "\"The BWRX-300 is in principle a boiling water reactor, which is used and well known by many European countries, including Finland and Sweden,\" noted Fermi Energia CEO Kalev Kallemets. \"However, the specific reactor model is much smaller than the ones used in the nuclear plants of our northern neighbours, which allows greater safety, lower cost, and shorter build time. At the same time, it is possible to rely on the experience of neighbours and offer the consumer clean electricity at an affordable and stable price.\"",
            "GEH and Fermi Energia have worked together since 2019 when an agreement was reached to collaborate on potential deployment applications for the BWRX-300. The collaboration advanced in 2021 when the two parties entered into a teaming agreement to work together in key areas that included licensing support and supply chain development.",
            "\"We are honoured that our small modular reactor technology has been selected by Fermi Energia to help Estonia fulfill its energy security and climate goals,\" said GEH President and CEO Jay Wileman. \"By leveraging a unique combination of existing fuel, plant simplifications, proven components and a design based on an already licensed reactor, the BWRX-300 offers cost-competitive zero-emission generation in a meaningful timeframe.\"",
            "GEH noted the technology selection by Fermi Energia is the latest development involving the BWRX-300. Last month, it was announced that GEH, Ontario Power Generation (OPG), SNC-Lavalin and Aecon have signed a contract for the deployment of a BWRX-300 SMR at OPG's Darlington site. In August last year, Tennessee Valley Authority began planning and preliminary licensing for potential deployment of a BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Site in Tennessee. Canada's SaskPower announced in June 2022 that it selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Saskatchewan in the mid-2030s.",
            "In Poland, ORLEN Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) and its partners started the pre-licensing process by submitting an application to Poland's National Atomic Energy Agency for assessment of the BWRX-300. OSGE plans to deploy a fleet of BWRX-300s with the potential for deployment of the first of those units by the end of this decade.",
            "To support the global deployment of the BWRX-300, GEH has a memorandum of understanding or other agreement in place with companies in Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, the UK, the USA and Sweden, among others. GEH has also begun the design certification process for the BWRX-300 in the UK.",
            "\"The choice of BWRX-300 by Polish, Swedish and other European companies gives assurance that the competence and supply chain of the selected technology will be sufficient in Europe,\" Kallemets said.",
            "Fermi Energia noted that, in order to construct a nuclear power plant in Estonia, a decision is needed from the parliament - the Riigikogu - to approve the use of nuclear energy in the country. Also, a special national plan to find a suitable location for the plant must be undertaken, as well as the development of nuclear energy legislation.",
            "\"We have analysed all the work ahead and consider it realistic to produce reliable, clean and affordable nuclear energy in Estonia by Christmas 2031, which should also be in the interest of society and the country's climate goals,\" Kallemets said. \"Understandably, this goal requires a serious effort from both the state and Fermi Energia.\"",
            "Fermi Energia was founded by Estonian energy and nuclear energy professionals to develop deployment of SMRs in Estonia. In July 2019, the company launched a feasibility study on the suitability of SMRs for Estonia's electricity supply and climate goals beyond 2030, following a financing round from investors and shareholders. It selected four SMR designs to be included in the feasibility study: Moltex Energy SSR-W300, Terrestrial Energy IMSR-400, GE Hitachi BWRX-300 and NuScale SMR.",

            "World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) chairman Tom Mitchell and new CEO Naoki Chigusa are optimistic about the future of the nuclear energy sector, and are taking steps to ensure the organisation is well placed to offer new players in the industry help and advice.",
            "Tom Mitchell, pictured at last year's Biennial General Meeting (Image: WANO)",
            "It is now more than three decades since WANO was created with a mission \"to maximise the safety and reliability of nuclear power plants worldwide\" and Mitchell and Chigusa are determined that it will continue to fulfil that function, with a wave of new entrants to the industry expected in the years ahead.",
            "they stressed the introduction of a new category of member (category 5), for those who do not yet have operating reactors (with WANO, each reactor is individually a member).",
            "The organisation carries out peer reviews, where experts from various member countries and companies visit other members to advise on safety and best practice. With new nuclear, the focus is on helping organisations move from the construction phase into the operation phase successfully, \"which is not a simple thing\".",
            "Mitchell says: \"As soon as an organisation decides they are going to build a plant, they should become a category 5 member because for a small investment they will gain a lot of knowledge - the sooner they are acclimated to what we’re doing and become part of what we call a community, they gain the most and by the time we get to the pre-startup peer review, they are in pretty good shape.\"",
            "And it does seem like there is likely to be a big number of new entrants to the sector, from countries developing their first nuclear power plants, to the dozens of small modular reactor developers and operators.",
            "Mitchell, who stresses that WANO is a safety-focused organisation that does not seek to advocate the case for nuclear, says that his personal view is that \"this is a very exciting time ... you know there is no credible way to deal with the climate change issue, the rapid decarbonisation, without nuclear. I’m not saying that nuclear is the only way to achieve this, there needs to be a mix\".",
            "\"Nuclear has a key and essential role in achieving this. We have to maintain this option - maintaining this option means we have to operate these plants safely and reliably, maintain public confidence in the technology and we need to be ready for potentially a whole new set of players who may not have that 45 years of experience that OPG has or others, who want to become part of this and be successful because I do believe that we are all in this together.\"",
            "Chigusa, who took over as CEO at the start of the year, has more than 40 years' experience in the nuclear industry, and will certainly have plenty to do in his new role - as well as the expanding membership numbers, there is a new Shanghai centre to add to WANO's existing regional centres in Paris, Moscow, Atlanta and Tokyo.",
            "He comes to the post after eight years as director general of WANO's Tokyo centre, where he played a key role in piloting the",
            "initiative which sees a lot more contact and on-going support for members on top of the peer-review missions that have been traditional.",
            "Chigusa says that as WANO CEO he can continue that work and take his fieldwork \"into the global organisation\" and bring it into the \"implementation stage without losing any momentum\". He says WANO must be \"visionary leaders\" in its key areas, wanting to \"embed\" its nuclear safety philosophy into newcomers.",
            "He also aims to spread his motto of harmony based on the first article of Japan’s 604AD constitution - uniting minds, understanding different interests and combining forces in one direction. Mitchell says the organisation is excited to have a different and fresh cultural perspective for what is a multinational and multicultural global organisation.",
            "One area is developing the language options for the organisation and members - English is its official language but better tools are being developed to avoid language issues, and to ensure WANO is not English-, or Western-, centric. Mitchell says that while executives might well have English at a high level, there are many people involved in key roles in operations who may not.",
            "Another development is the transitioning of the Shanghai office from a supporting role to a regional centre, under Director Chen Hua, who has previously served as a WANO governor at the Tokyo centre’s regional governing board. There is also some continuity with the appointment of Kim Keeyoung - previously at KHNP and a previous deputy director secondee at the WANO Tokyo centre - as Chigusa’s successor as director general of the Tokyo centre.",
            "Meanwhile attention continues to be focused on what can be done to help amid the on-going war in Ukraine, which has seen one of its member nuclear power plants occupied by the military of another of its members.",
            "The organisation seeks to focus on safety issues and is non-political, and does not have the diplomatic capability of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \"to have boots on the ground\". This has led to a two-pronged approach, of supporting and collaborating with the IAEA’s efforts, and seeking to support the plant operators in Ukraine, including a recent mission carried out virtually.",
            "\"Our mantra has always been that we are here to support the operators … we don’t want any power plant to become isolated, we are all part of a community and I think we all agree that our mission is nuclear safety and we don’t think it would be in the interest of nuclear safety for any organisation or plant to become isolated. We’re going to support all of our members, try to find creative ways to accommodate the situation and not letting any group or organisation become separated,\" Mitchell said.",

Dow also intends to take a minority equity stake in X-energy.",
            "The Xe-100 is one of two designs selected by the US Department of Energy (DOE) in 2020 to receive USD80 million each of initial cost-shared funding to build an advanced reactor demonstration plant that can be operational within seven years. A four-unit Xe-100 plant is planned for construction at a site in Washington state.",
            "\"As a sub-awardee under the US Department of Energy's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) Cooperative Agreement with X-energy, Dow intends to work with X-energy to install their Xe-100 high-temperature gas-cooled reactor plant at one of Dow's US Gulf Coast sites, providing the site with safe, reliable, low-carbon power and steam within this decade,\" X-energy said.",
            "The JDA includes up to USD50 million in engineering work, up to half of which is eligible to be funded through ARDP, and the other half by Dow. The JDA work scope also includes the preparation and submission of a construction permit application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).",
            "Working with DOE and subject to its review and approval, Dow and X-energy expect to finalise site selection in 2023. The companies intend to perform further ARDP-related work under the JDA as the project progresses. Additionally, they have agreed to develop a framework to jointly license and utilise the technology and learnings from the project, which would enable other industrial customers to effectively utilise Xe-100 industrial low-carbon energy technology.",
            "Each Xe-100 reactor is engineered to operate as a single 80 MW electric unit, optimised as a four-unit plant delivering 320 MWe. The reactor can provide baseload power to an electricity system or support industrial applications with 200 MW thermal output per unit of high pressure, high temperature steam.",
            "\"The four-reactor Xe-100 nuclear plant will provide a Dow facility with cost-competitive, low-carbon process heat and power to make essential products used by consumers and businesses every day,\" X-energy said.",
            "Dow is working to deliver a 30% reduction in its scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The company is working to transition its sites and operations globally to cleaner power.",
            "\"The utilisation of X-energy's fourth generation nuclear technology will enable Dow to take a major step in reducing our carbon emissions while delivering lower carbon footprint products to our customers and society,\" said Dow chairman and CEO Jim Fitterling. \"The collaboration with X-energy and the DOE will serve as a leading example of how the industrial sector can safely, effectively and affordably decarbonise.\"",
            "\"X-energy's collaboration with Dow brings added significance because of the immense opportunity to further reduce emissions in the energy-intensive industrial sector,\" said X-energy CEO Clay Sell. \"From the beginning to the end of the supply chain, our technology can supply both power and heat to businesses in most sectors of the economy to help limit their carbon footprint. We are thrilled to work with Dow to deliver a successful project and illustrate the broad, highly flexible applications of X-energy's proprietary nuclear energy technology.\"",

            "On nuclear, the government has launched Great British Nuclear (GBN), which will be responsible for driving the delivery of new nuclear projects, with the aim of increasing the share of nuclear in the UK's electricity mix from the current 15% to 25% by 2050. GBN will be based in or around the Greater Manchester area and operate through British Nuclear Fuels Limited. It will initially be led by Simon Bowen as interim Chair and Gwen Parry-Jones as interim CEO.",
            "\"The first priority for GBN is to launch a competitive process to select the best small modular reactor (SMR) technologies,\" the paper said. \"This will commence in April with market engagement as the first phase. The second phase – the down-selection process - will be launched in the summer, with an ambition to assess and decide on the leading technologies by Autumn. We will co-fund the selected technologies through their development and will work with successful bidders on ensuring the right financing and site arrangements are in place, in line with our commitment to take two Final Investment Decisions in the next parliament.",
            "\"The government has also launched the Future Nuclear Enabling Fund of up to GBP120 million to provide targeted support for new nuclear to address barriers to entry and will announce a shortlist of applications to begin pre-grant award due-diligence soon.\"",
            "The government noted that nuclear energy has been used \"reliably and safely\" in the UK for more than 60 years and \"we have extensive experience of the full nuclear life cycle, from front-end design through to decommissioning\". It added: \"We are matching the global competition and scaling-up our nuclear programme by having launched GBN, responsible for driving delivery of new nuclear projects, backed with the funding it needs.\"",
            "The policy paper says the government wants UK companies to \"continue playing a key role in green supply chains, from nuclear to CCUS and electric vehicles. For example, nuclear power station Hinkley Point C has spent over GBP4.1 billion with suppliers in the Southwest to date and EDF anticipate that 64% of the construction value of the project will be spent with UK firms, with over 22,000 people nationwide currently working on the project\".",
            "\"We're driving forward plans to boost renewables, revive nuclear and build new thriving industries like carbon capture, which will in turn create good jobs across the country, provide new opportunities for British businesses at home and abroad, and maintain our world-leading action to reach net-zero,\" said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
            "Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: \"Great British Nuclear will transform the way nuclear projects are deployed in the UK, enabling us to deliver more capacity more quickly. It will help us become a global leader in large and small scale nuclear, with the SMR selection process offering a real opportunity for home-grown technologies and others to bring jobs, skills and investment to the UK.\"",
            "He added: \"For nuclear to provide a quarter of Britain's electricity means embarking on an ambitious new build programme, including a fleet of new stations, as well as placing nuclear on par with other green technologies to drive crucial investment. More nuclear will cut gas imports, cut carbon and create good jobs for communities all across the country.\"",

            "Energoatom President Petro Kotin at the signing ceremony (Image: Energoatom)",
            "The agreement was signed on 21 April by Energoatom President Petro Kotin in Kiev and Holtec CEO Kris Singh in Camden, New Jersey, USA. The ceremony was also attended by Ukraine's Minister of Energy Herman Galushchenko and the vice president of Holtec International operations in Ukraine Riaz Avan.",
            "The cooperation agreement envisions implementation of the first SMR-160 Pilot Project with the goal to reach minimum controlled reactor power and connection to the grid by March 2029, Holtec said. \"The cooperation agreement further contemplates Energoatom and Holtec jointly developing an efficient execution plan for an expedited construction and commissioning of up to 20 additional SMR-160 plants in Ukraine and for establishing a manufacturing facility in the country for localising the production of a variety of equipment required to build SMR-160 reactors\".",
            "The agreement calls for a joint project office to be established to begin work required for licensing and deployment of Holtec's SMR-160s throughout Ukraine, with a focus on former coal generation sites. Energoatom noted the office will be staffed \"not only by representatives of Energoatom and Holtec International, but also by the State Atomic Energy Regulatory Commission, the National Nuclear Research and Development Centre of Ukraine, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine, and world-renowned companies Mitsubishi, Hyundai, and others\".",
            "\"Construction of small modular reactors (SMRs) in Ukraine would not only contribute to the strengthening of the country's energy security, but would also allow replacing thermal power plants destroyed by Russian attacks and achieving decarbonisation goals,\" Galushchenko said. \"We plan a complete replacement of thermal generation. The best way to replace coal is with small modular reactors. SMRs are a powerful technology that would also allow us to decentralise the generation.\"",
            "\"The cooperation agreement between Energoatom and Holtec International signed today for deployment of SMR-160s is based on two decades of demonstrated successful cooperation between the two companies,\" Kotin said.",
            "\"This cooperation agreement will lead to economic development, creation of jobs, establishment of modern manufacturing facilities, training facilities, R&D, and thus help Ukraine emerge as the regional hub for Holtec's nuclear reactor technology. Furthermore, the cooperation agreement will play an important role in enhancing Ukraine's energy security and advancing our country’s decarbonisation, energy independence, and diversification goals\".",
            "Singh added: \"We will stand shoulder to shoulder with you to build and commission up to 20 SMR-160 reactors in record time. We are committed to helping the Ukrainian nation rebuild its energy infrastructure.\"",
            "Holtec's 160 MWe factory-built SMR uses low-enriched uranium fuel. The reactor's core and all nuclear steam supply system components would be located underground, and the design incorporates a wealth of features including a passive cooling system that would be able to operate indefinitely after shutdown. No active components, such as pumps, are needed to run the reactor, which does not need any on-site or off-site power to shut down and to dissipate decay heat.",
            "\"This agreement seeks to strengthen the decades-long relationship between Ukraine and Holtec to provide clean energy solutions to the nation and sets down a pathway for a green energy future for Ukraine in the post-Russian aggression age,\" Holtec said.",
            "In March 2018, a memorandum of understanding was signed between Holtec and Energoatom envisaging the adoption by Ukraine of Holtec's SMR technology with the country becoming a manufacturing hub for SMR-160 reactor components. The MoU included the licensing and construction of SMR-160 reactors in Ukraine, as well as the partial localisation of SMR-160 components. The Ukrainian manufacturing hub is to mirror the capabilities of Holtec's Advanced Manufacturing Plant in Camden, and will be one of four manufacturing plants Holtec plans to build at distributed sites around the world by the mid-2020s.",
            "In June 2019, Holtec, Energoatom and Ukraine's State Scientific and Technology Centre formally entered into a partnership to advance the SMR-160 for deployment in Ukraine. The partners ratified the creation of a consortium partnership that bound the three companies into a cooperative undertaking to progress the deployment of the SMR-160 small modular reactor in the country. The consortium is a US company registered in Delaware with each of the three parties owning allotted shares. Its technology operation centre will be based in Kiev, Ukraine.",

            "Project collaborators include ABS, HD KSOE, KEPCO E&C and the Liberian International Ship & Corporate Registry (LISCR).",
            "The floating small modular reactor (SMR) barge is intended to serve as offshore power generation for remote communities and island electrification. HD KSOE provided basic designs for the marine systems, then ABS and LISCR completed design reviews based on class and statutory requirements. Kepco E&C will continue to work on risk assessments for future applications.",
            "As part of the Novel Concept Class Approval process, ABS grants an approval in principle at an early conceptual design phase to assist the client in demonstrating project feasibility to its project partners and regulatory bodies. Approval in principle confirms that the proposed novel concept that includes the new technology complies with the intent of the most applicable ABS Rules and Guides as well as required appropriate industry codes and standards, subject to a list of conditions.",
            "\"Modern nuclear technologies are increasingly suggested as a potential solution to lower carbon emissions,\" said ABS Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer Patrick Ryan. \"Floating production platforms like this barge from HD KSOE have the possibility to scale more easily than what can be done on land. ABS is proud to apply our research and experience to innovative projects such as this one.\"",
            "\"This barge design not only eliminates the inconvenience of selecting onshore sites by being installed at sea but also offers the advantage of an integrated design for thermal energy production,\" added Kim Sung-Jun, Director of Future Technology at HD KSOE. \"This increases the potential to support the production of eco-friendly ship fuels like ammonia or methanol. Furthermore, HD KSOE has invested USD30 million in the fourth-generation SMR company, TerraPower, and we have plans to accelerate the development of future nuclear-powered ships by establishing an SMR research team.\"",
            "Kepco E&C Senior Director Moon Young-Tae said: \"Kepco E&C developed the APR1400, which received design certification from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2019 and has continuously designed more than 30 nuclear power plants at home and abroad over the past 40 years.",
            "\"In addition, we have our own marine SMR, BANDI, and we are making efforts to develop marine SMR technology as well as onshore SMR. Based on our abundant experience in the nuclear power business and accumulated technology, we will actively contribute to decarbonisation for the environment and future generations.\"",
            "The BANDI-60 - under development since 2016 - is a block-type pressurised water reactor with a power output of 200MWt/60MWe. According to Kepco E&C, the block-type design - in which the main components are directly connected, nozzle-to-nozzle, instead of using connecting pipes - can eliminate the risk of a large-break loss-of-coolant accident and also provides improved operational surveillance and maintenance as compared with the integral type design. The reactor would operate at a temperature of around 325°C. To enhance the safety and performance, Kepco C&E says several advanced design features are adopted such as soluble boron-free operation, an in-vessel control rod drive mechanism, and top-mounted in-core instrumentation.",
            "South Korean shipbuilder Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) announced in January that it had completed the conceptual design for the CMSR Power Barge - a floating nuclear power plant based on compact molten salt reactors - and obtained an approval in principle for the design from the ABS.",
            "In April last year, SHI and Danish company Seaborg Technologies signed a memorandum of understanding to manufacture and sell turnkey power plants combining SHI's ship-building expertise and Seaborg's compact molten salt reactor. It also covered the development of hydrogen production plants and ammonia plants.",

            "Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) and NuScale Power Corporation  have mutually agreed to terminate the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP). The project to build NuScale small modular reactor units at a site near Idaho Falls had been pencilled in for operation by 2029.",
            "A rendering of a NuScale plant (Image: NuScale)",
            "\"Despite significant efforts by both parties to advance the CFPP, it appears unlikely that the project will have enough subscription to continue toward deployment. Therefore, UAMPS and NuScale have mutually determined that ending the project is the most prudent decision for both parties,\" the parties said.",
            "In July, CFPP LLC had applied to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a Limited Work Authorisation to begin early construction activities for the proposed plant on a site at the Idaho National Laboratory. Early-scope construction had been expected to begin in mid-2025.",
            "UAMPS - a political subdivision of the state of Utah - identified a preferred site near Idaho Falls for the construction of a small modular reactor (SMR) in 2016. In 2020 the US Department of Energy approved a multi-year cost share award to CFPP LLC of up to USD1.4 billion to help demonstrate and deploy a NuScale power plant there, and work on the combined licence application began in 2021. UAMPS had been working towards submitting a combined construction and operating licence application to the NRC in January 2024, for a plant with six of NuScale's 77 MWe power modules to generate 462 MWe of electricity. NuScale placed its first order for long-lead materials for the plant with Korean firm Doosan Enerbility at the end of 2022.",
            "\"This decision is very disappointing given the years of pioneering hard work put into the CFPP by UAMPS, CFPP LLC, NuScale, US Department of Energy, and the UAMPS member communities that took the leadership role to launch the CFPP,\" said UAMPS CEO and General Manager Mason Baker. \"Yet, this decision is the best course for the UAMPS members participating in the CFPP and doing what is best for those member communities will always be the guiding light in such decisions.\"",
            "NuScale's VOYGR SMR - a pressurised water reactor with all the components for steam generation and heat exchange incorporated into a single 77 MWe unit - is the first SMR design to have received approval from the NRC and is under consideration for construction in various countries around the world including in Poland, where a plan by copper and silver producer KGHM Polska Miedź SA's to build a power plant based on NuScale Power's SMR has been approved by the Ministry of Climate and Environment.",
            "NuScale President and CEO John Hopkins said the company's UAMPS work and its partnership with the DOE had enabled it to advance its Power Modules to a proven SMR technology that has regulatory approval and is in active production.",
            "\"Our work with CFPP over the past 10 years has advanced NuScale technology to the stage of commercial deployment. Reaching that milestone is a tremendous success which we will continue to build on with future customers,\" he said. \"NuScale will continue with our other domestic and international customers to bring our American SMR technology to market and grow the US nuclear manufacturing base, creating jobs across the US. We thank UAMPS for the collaboration that has enabled this advancement.\"",
            "The US Nuclear Energy Institute said the decision was \"disappointing\" but understandable. \"Despite significant effort and hard work from both parties, the project has been unable to reach the subscription levels required for this phase of the project to continue toward deployment,\" the organisation said.",
            "\"Although the Carbon-Free Power Project is not moving forward at this time, it is not a question of the promise of next-generation nuclear but rather the comfort that the customer has in being the first to bring the product to market. The demand for reliable, affordable, and clean generation is growing around the world,\" it added.",
            "NuScale Power was the first SMR developer to undergo a business combination to accelerate the commercialisation of its technology. In May 2022, it merged with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp to create the world's first publicly traded SMR technology provider.",
            "CFPP LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of UAMPS, a project-based consortium providing power supply, transmission and other services to its 50 members across the states of Utah, Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, and Wyoming.

            "The HTR-PM features two small reactors (each of 250 MWt) that drive a single 210 MWe steam turbine. It uses helium as coolant and graphite as the moderator. Each reactor is loaded with more than 400,000 spherical fuel elements (‘pebbles’), each 60 mm in diameter and containing 7 g of fuel enriched to 8.5%. Each pebble has an outer layer of graphite and contains some 12,000 four-layer ceramic-coated fuel particles dispersed in a graphite matrix. The fuel has high inherent safety characteristics, and has been shown to remain intact and to continue to contain radioactivity at temperatures up to 1620°C - far higher than the temperatures that would be encountered even in extreme accident situations, according to the China Nuclear Energy Association.",
            "First concrete for the demonstration project was poured on December 2012, with the operating permit granted in August 2021 and the plant connected to the grid in December 2021. ​The plant has more than 2200 sets of first-of-a-kind equipment, including more than 660 sets of innovative equipment. The supporting fuel element production line has the largest production capacity in the world.",
            "The project is a collaborative effort involving Tsinghua University as a technical leader, responsible for research and development and main components and systems design, with China Huaneng Group as the owner and operator of the plant, and China National Nuclear Coorporation as the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor and fuel manufacturer. Professor Zuoyi Zhang, director of the Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology at Tsinghua University, is the chief scientist and chief engineer for the project.",

            "A Tsinghua spokesperson said: \"The normal energy transfer driven by power was stopped during the tests. The measured nuclear power and temperatures within the different reactor structures, described how the reactors were naturally cooled down, without intervention of humans or emergency core cooling systems. The tests confirmed that commercial-scale reactors could be cooled down naturally without emergency core cooling systems for the first time in the world. It is the so-called inherently safe reactor.",
            "\"The major purpose of HTR-PM is to co-generate high temperature steam up to 500℃ and electricity. It is cost effective currently in the Chinese market to supply steam and electricity for the petrochemical industry to substitute the burning of natural gas and coal. This breakthrough technology is recognised to play a positive role in optimising energy structure and achieving China's 'dual carbon' goal. Several commercial projects are under preparation in China.\"",

            "While global growth in electricity demand eased slightly to 2.2% in 2023 due to falling electricity consumption in advanced economies, it is projected to accelerate to an average of 3.4% from 2024 through to 2026. About 85% of the increase in the world's electricity demand through to 2026 is expected to come from outside advanced economies - most notably China, India and countries in Southeast Asia.",
            "However, record-setting electricity generation from low-emission sources - including nuclear power - should reduce the role of fossil fuels in providing power for homes and businesses. Low-emission sources are expected to account for almost half of the world's electricity generation by 2026, up from a share of 39% in 2023.",
            "By 2025, nuclear power generation is forecast to reach an all-time high globally - exceeding the previous record set in 2021 - as output from France climbs, several plants in Japan are restarted, and new reactors begin commercial operations in many markets, including in China, India, South Korea and Europe. The IEA expects global nuclear generation to be almost 10% higher in 2026 compared with 2023.",
            "Between 2024 and 2026, an additional 29 GW of new nuclear capacity is expected to come online globally. Asia remains the main driver of growth in nuclear power, with the region's share of global nuclear generation forecast to reach 30% in 2026.",
            "The IEA says the increase in electricity generation from renewables and nuclear \"appears to be pushing the power sector's emissions into structural decline\". Over the next three years, low-emissions generation is set to rise at twice the annual growth rate between 2018 and 2023. Global emissions from electricity generation are expected to decrease by 2.4% in 2024, followed by smaller declines in 2025 and 2026.",
            "\"The power sector currently produces more CO2 emissions than any other in the world economy, so it's encouraging that the rapid growth of renewables and a steady expansion of nuclear power are together on course to match all the increase in global electricity demand over the next three years,\" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. \"This is largely thanks to the huge momentum behind renewables, with ever cheaper solar leading the way, and support from the important comeback of nuclear power, whose generation is set to reach a historic high by 2025. While more progress is needed, and fast, these are very promising trends.\"",
            ", released in September last year, the IEA revised upwards the role of nuclear power. In the updated net-zero emissions (NZE) scenario, nuclear generating capacity more than doubles to reach 916 GWe in 2050.",

Puerto Rico currently generates 98% of its electricity from imported fossil fuels, and its power plants, built in the late 1960s, experience outage rates 12 times higher than the US average. Within the next decade, Puerto Rico proposes a transition from a centralised system dependent on fossil fuels to a distributed system centred on clean energy. Its legislature in 2018 passed a bill calling for an investigation into the possibility of building nuclear power plants on the island, which suffered widespread outages following Hurricane Maria in 2017.",
            "Announcing the publication of its latest report - titled",
            "Advanced Small Nuclear in Puerto Rico - Economic Study",
            "- NAP said: \"This report encompasses a wide array of aspects surrounding Puerto Rico's economy and energy sector. We explore market conditions and their performance based on key energy-economic indicators, and socio-economic implications to construct a holistic understanding of the energy landscape associated with potential developments of advanced small nuclear power plants in Puerto Rico.\"",
            "NAP said the key findings of the study \"encompass various facets, including national energy demand, micro and small modular reactor (SMR) energy demand, energy supply, physical infrastructure, climate change, and financial and economic sufficiency\".",
            "The study found that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in Puerto Rico is about USD32,000 per year, ranking it 19th among the 65 countries compared, \"surpassing 17 countries with robust nuclear energy developments or policy support, such as the Slovak Republic, Turkey, Romania, Russia, Bulgaria, and Argentina\".",
            "With regards to Puerto Rico's energy consumption per capita, over the past 10 years there has been a 1.8% decline in the annual average growth. However, the report notes that the current level is higher than countries with strong support for nuclear, like Ukraine, Turkey, Argentina, Romania, Brazil and Mexico.",
            "The island also has aging energy infrastructure, with an average lifetime of around 43 years. Four of its power plants, with a combined capacity of 3600 MWe, were scheduled to be retired in 2023 but this did not happen.",
            "\"When analysing the economic conditions of Puerto Rico, it becomes evident that a strong industrial sector, accounting for 51% of the total GDP, coupled with a high level of real GDP per capita, approximately USD32,000 per year, positions the country favourably for the introduction of advanced micro and small nuclear reactors,\" the report says.",
            "\"The significant dependency on fuel imports, amounting to around USD1.5 billion in 2021, presents a considerable challenge for Puerto Rico. By developing renewable energy sources, which currently represent 7% of the energy infrastructure and generate around 10% of the total electricity, advanced nuclear reactors could play a pivotal role in diversifying the energy mix.",
            "\"In conclusion, while micro and small nuclear reactors may not always appear as the most cost-effective solution in the short term, a value-based approach prompts us to consider their broader benefits. By focusing on the flexibility, reliability and environmental advantages they bring, we recognise that their worth extends far beyond initial construction costs. Embracing a value-based perspective allows to see these reactors not as expensive burdens, but as valuable assets in the transition to a more sustainable and resilient energy future.\"",
            "NAP was founded in 2016 by Puerto Rican engineers in the US nuclear industry to inform and advocate for SMRs and microreactors in Puerto Rico.",
            "A preliminary feasibility study published by NAP in May 2020 concluded that advanced nuclear reactors can meet Puerto Rico's unique energy needs by complementing renewable sources with zero-emission electricity resilient to extreme natural events. The study was funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE).",
            "In November 2021, DOE awarded USD1.6 million in funding to NAP to study the potential siting of small reactors in Puerto Rico. NAP has identified two potential sites on the island, based on US Nuclear Regulatory Commission criteria.",

            "floating seismic isolation system",
            "A team led by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency has concluded a series of large-scale demonstration tests for an innovative new floating seismic isolation system intended for pairing with small modular reactors to enable siting feasibility, including in areas of high seismicity.",
            "Testing of the FSIS (Image: JAEA)",
            "The series of tests - which ran from 29 January to 9 February - used a 1/15-scale mockup of the structure of a small modular reactor (SMR) plant design (measuring 9 metres in length, 3 metres wide and 5 metres high) floating in a water tank mounted on the world's largest shaking table, operated by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED) in Miki City, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan.",
            "NIED and IHI Corporation, a major nuclear equipment vendor, cooperated with Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) in the testing. The seismic waves input to the shaking table are based on some of the largest earthquakes observed, including the March 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Multiple accelerometers installed on the floating body and in the surrounding water pool measure the characteristic response of the floating seismic isolation structure and demonstrate its seismic isolation performance.",
            "Japan's proprietary floating seismic isolation system (FSIS) technology is focused on the use of a series of air cavities for seismic response damping and associated orifices for energy dissipation of seismic motion as seismic isolators in a structural platform paired to the base of an SMR plant that floats in a water pool. JAEA says it is a passive system with design adaptable to a broad range of site seismic conditions and capable of reducing the seismic response of the paired SMR in the horizontal and vertical directions.",
            "A schematic showing the pairing of the FSIS technology with an SMR (Image: JAEA)",
            "JAEA claims the system provides such effective and omnidirectional seismic isolation that it is expected to yield increases in design margin and enhanced design standardisation for an SMR because the seismic damping will permit a single reactor/seismic isolation pairing design to be safe against seismic hazards even for sites with challenging seismic design conditions.",
            "\"The FSIS paired reactor plant is supported by buoyancy while the isolators of the cavities and orifices resist seismic load,\" JAEA said. \"The effective and relatively simple concept is intended to greatly enhance both safety and reliability for the paired SMR.\"",
            "The tests are part of a national project funded by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry through its nuclear energy innovation programme (NEXIP). In parallel, the project is evaluating specific safety and regulatory approaches to pairing of the FSIS and SMR plant concepts in cooperation with industry partners. The data acquired in the current tests will be used for validation of the seismic design and safety analysis methods for the FSIS-paired SMR concepts.",
            "JAEA and its industry partners have begun pre-application engagement with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) with the expectation that JAEA's industry partners will eventually submit a Standard Design Approval application for an SMR design paired with the FSIS. The current test will provide supporting data for the regulatory engagement. The NRC observed the tests in progress and audited quality assurance program for the FSIS testing.",
            "The FSIS is potentially deployable with reactors of any type and with a plant containing single or multiple reactor units, JAEA said. The FSIS paired SMR design concept as described by the JAEA will withstand the terrestrial ground accelerations associated with high seismic risk zones that may not be suitable for conventional nuclear plant construction.",
            "\"Nuclear energy is expected to play a key role of decarbonisation in many countries,\" JAEA said. \"Offering the FSIS will enable potential deployment of SMRs in Japan and elsewhere, where challenging seismic conditions would otherwise limit siting availability for new builds.\"",
            "In February last year, Japan's Cabinet approved a policy that calls to develop and construct \"next-generation innovative reactors.\" Under the new policy, Japan will also collaborate with overseas projects by maintaining and strengthening domestic supply chains and contributing Japan`s technology and expertise.",

            "Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) has announced a target of achieving carbon-neutral operations at the Chalk River Laboratories site in Ontario by 2040. It said connecting to the small modular reactor proposed for the site could contribute to meeting this target.",
            "The Chalk River Laboratories campus (Image: CNL)",
            "The target is outlined in CNL's newly-released",
            "2023 ESG Report, A CNL Sustainability Performance Update",
            ", an annual document that tracks the company's progress towards sustainable operations, and among other goals, was established to support the Canadian government in its commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.",
            "The new carbon emission reduction plan was put in place to fulfill environmental objectives set out by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) in its environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy. CNL operates Chalk River Laboratories on behalf of AECL, who owns the site, under a government-owned, company-operated management model. Together, the organisations will work together over the next two decades to reduce emissions by approximately 90% to near-zero, and then balance out any remaining emissions with strategic carbon offsets.",
            "Among the organisational changes identified in its Carbon Neutral Strategy are: updated engineering standards and climate resilience planning requirements for all new construction projects and retrofits; energy performance improvements through the adoption of electric heating and conservation measures; the decommissioning and removal of outdated, inefficient buildings; and the electrification of CNL's vehicle fleet.",
            "\"CNL is even exploring the potential to connect to a small modular reactor (SMR) proposed for construction at the Chalk River site, leveraging the clean energy from the reactor to further offset the carbon footprint of CNL's operations,\" the company said.",
            "Global First Power Ltd - a joint venture launched in 2020 by Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC) and Ontario Power Generation - aims to build, own and operate a proposed Micro Modular Reactor (MMR) at the Chalk River Laboratories site by 2030. The 10 MWt (3.3 MWe) to 45 MWt (15 MWe) MMR high temperature gas-cooled reactor would provide process heat to an adjacent plant via a molten salt heat exchange system, and would serve as a model for future SMR deployments. It is based on UNSC's proprietary Fully Ceramic Micro-encapsulated fuel technology, which is a tristructural-isotropic - or TRISO - fuel.",
            "\"At CNL, we understand that the actions we take today will have an impact on future generations, so we must make responsible decisions in the modernisation and operation of the Chalk River Laboratories site,\" said CNL President and CEO Joe McBrearty. \"And that starts with reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. CNL has already reduced our GHG emissions by approximately 30% relative to 2005 levels, and we are poised to achieve a 40% reduction by 2025. To meet our net-zero by 2040 targets, we have developed a Consolidated Carbon Neutral Strategy which will guide our ongoing business activities, ensuring that GHG emissions are factored into all our operational decisions, big and small.\"",
            "\"As a federal Crown corporation and the owner of the Chalk River Laboratories, AECL has set ambitious targets within our ESG strategy to meet the Government of Canada's net-zero goals by 2050,\" said AECL President and CEO Fred Dermarkar. \"With the unique opportunity to leverage our nuclear science and technology capabilities, AECL has accelerated the target to meet carbon neutrality at the Chalk River site by 2040. We are encouraged by CNL's work in Chalk River to implement their carbon neutral strategy.\"",
            "\"Sustainability is far more than sound environmental stewardship,\" CNL said. \"The ambitious emissions target is part of a much broader, comprehensive plan to fulfill the delivery of sustainability-related objectives at Canada's national nuclear laboratory.",
            "\"As part of this plan, CNL completed an ESG materiality assessment in 2023 that will guide improvement efforts across seven major focus areas, including waste management, climate resilience, ecosystem services, community relationships, employee engagement and well-being, effective leadership and responsible supply chain. This assessment was the product of a thorough stakeholder engagement exercise, which included a survey of over 700 stakeholders and in-depth interviews to gather feedback and refine the company's ESG priorities.\"",
            "\"Whether it was the development of our new forest management plan, the creation of an Indigenous procurement strategy, or the launch of our new education programming, CNL has had an exceptional year in our pursuit of more sustainable operations,\" McBrearty added. \"However, I think the completion of our ESG materiality assessment will have the greatest impact on our operations, because it allows CNL to look inward at our operations through the eyes of our stakeholders and identify the issues and opportunities that we must prioritise as a company.\"",

            "MSRs use molten fluoride salts as primary coolant, at low pressure. They may operate with epithermal or fast neutron spectrums, and with a variety of fuels. Much of the interest today in reviving the MSR concept relates to using thorium (to breed fissile uranium-233), where an initial source of fissile material such as plutonium-239 needs to be provided. There are a number of different MSR design concepts, and a number of interesting challenges in the commercialisation of many, especially with thorium.",

The reactor will be able to recycle long-lived waste from existing nuclear facilities. The Thorizon One concept is unique in that the core is composed of a set of cartridges that is replaced every five to ten years. This, the company says, overcomes two molten salt design obstacles: material corrosion and handling of used fuel volumes.",
            "Under the new agreement, EDF R&D will review Thorizon's neutronic core calculations and conduct scenario analyses to determine how the Thorizon One could help to close the fuel cycle in the European reactor fleet.",
            "Thorizon said it will \"benefit from EDF's expertise as the French leader in electricity production, and in particular from the recognised skills of its R&D researchers\".",
            "\"The R&D team covers all disciplines from neutronics and fuel to safety and construction,\" said Bernard Salha, EDF R&D Director and EDF Group Chief Technical Officer. \"We are actively supporting several start-ups in the France 2030 programme. The cartridge-based approach of Thorizon is interesting and promising.\"",
            "\"It is a pleasure to work with the EDF team which has more experience in nuclear than any company across the globe,\" added Thorizon CEO Kiki Lauwers. \"Thanks to EDF R&D, start-ups like us benefit from access to unique industry experts that can very quickly spot the strengths and areas for improvements in our design. We hope we can continue to work with the EDF R&D team on the realisation of our technology in the future. We believe all solutions are needed to empower the energy transition and the Thorizon One can be a great compliment to the existing and planned nuclear fleet.\"",
            "Horizon says its ambition is to develop an MSR that \"can be realised rapidly and smartly, is 'walk-away' safe, and takes a first step towards circularity by using long-lived nuclear waste as a fuel source\". The company aims to build a non-nuclear molten salt demonstrator in the short-term and finalise the detailed design to start building a first-of-a-kind Thorizon One reactor by 2030.",
            "Blue Capsule - a spin-off from France's Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) - has announced the signing of a partnership agreement with the CEA for the development of its small modular reactor (SMR) that will supply heat and power to industry.",
            "An illustration of a plant comprising six capsules (Image: Blue Capsule)",
            "Aix-en-Provence-based Blue Capsule is developing a sodium-cooled, high-temperature SMR which can provide 150 MW of heat at 700°C, along with high-temperature steam and electricity. The company aims to decarbonise industrial sites used for ammonia and soda ash production, with subterranean capsules co-located onsite, close to demand.",
            "Under the new agreement - with financial support from French public investment bank Bpifrance - CEA's support for Blue Capsule will extend to fields such as equipment and components, materials, calculation codes and TRISO-based fuel.",
            "\"France's leadership in the fields of nuclear energy and low-carbon solutions is creating big opportunities for industry right across the country,\" said Blue Capsule's reactor architect Domnin Erard. \"And for Blue Capsule, collaboration with the French nuclear sector is front and centre of our strategy.",
            "\"This vital partnership with the CEA means that Blue Capsule benefits from world-class expertise across the board. It lays the foundations for our future industrial cooperation with the French nuclear supply chain, for manufacturing and assembling Blue Capsule units.",
            "\"It all comes down to cutting industrial CO2 emissions and of course the re-industrialisation of communities in France and beyond. For our part, we'll do everything we can to help achieve that objective.\"",
            "Blue Capsule is planning to build a proof-of-concept sodium loop and a non-nuclear prototype by 2030. The company's first-of-a-kind SMR is scheduled for construction by 2035 and is set to be built in France.",

            "Steady Energy said it is set to start construction of its first LDR-50 district heating reactor pilot plant in Finland next year, with potential sites including the Finnish capital Helsinki and two other cities.",
            "A multiple LDR-50 unit plant (Image: Steady Energy)",
            "The pilot plant will serve as a full-scale, operational model of the Finnish-designed small modular reactor (SMR). Unlike the actual power plant, the pilot unit will use an electric element to produce heat inside the reactor capsule instead of nuclear fuel. The main purpose is to test operational features and to establish the necessary supply chains with various manufacturers to construct actual plants.",
            "The pilot investment is estimated to be about EUR15–20 million (USD16–22 million). Steady Energy said final evaluations of potential sites are under way, with a decision expected by the end of summer. Following this, detailed planning and tendering for construction will commence. After the testing phase, the facility will be used for training and research purposes.",
            "Currently, the proposed locations for the pilot plant include: Salmisaari caves in central Helsinki; Huuhanmäki caves in Kuopio, the regional capital of North Savo in eastern Finland; and the power plant sites at Kymijärvi and Teivaanmäki in Lahti, a regional capital in southern Finland.",
            "Steady Energy - which was spun out in May 2023 from the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland - expects the construction of the first operational LDR-50 district heating plant to begin by 2028, with the first unit expected to be operational by 2030.",
            "Last December, the company signed a letter of intent with municipal energy company Kuopion Energia in Eastern Finland that includes an option for the construction of up to five district heating reactors starting in 2030. That agreement followed a letter of intent signed in October between Steady Energy and Helsinki's energy company Helen for the construction of up to 10 SMRs for district heating.",
            "In Finland, more than half of the energy used for heating comes from district heating, which is mostly produced with fossil fuels, peat and biomass. Utilities are seeking ways to swiftly transit away from combustion-based heat production to new and innovative low emission alternatives such as SMRs.",
            "Steady Energy noted that a \"significant milestone towards emission-free heating\" was achieved in February 2024 when the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority removed the distance-based safety zones for new nuclear plants. This change allows SMRs to be located near residential areas.",
            "\"Given that district heating plants need to be situated close to urban areas, current city centres often house large coal, peat, gas and oil power plants,\" the company said. \"Replacing these with container-sized small nuclear units will free up valuable land for residents in the heart of cities.\"",
            "\"While Finland has made great progress in green electricity production, we still heat our cities with fossil fuels and biomass,\" said Steady Energy CEO Tommi Nyman. \"Heating a large city can require a log pile the size of a football field each day. Replacing this with a small, emission-free nuclear power plant that can be installed underground will eliminate the endless lines of fuel trucks and radically reduce local air pollution.\"",
            "The LDR-50 district heating SMR - with a thermal output of 50 MW - has been under development at VTT since 2020. Designed to operate at around 150°C and below 10 bar (145 psi), Steady Energy says its \"operating conditions are less demanding compared with those of traditional reactors, simplifying the technical solutions needed to meet the high safety standards of the nuclear industry\". It noted that its reactors are affordable enough for municipal utilities to invest in independently.",
            "The LDR-50 reactor module is made of two nested pressure vessels, with their intermediate space partially filled with water. When heat removal through the primary heat exchangers is compromised, water in the intermediate space begins to boil, forming an efficient passive heat transfer route into the reactor pool, the company said. The system does not rely on electricity or any mechanical moving parts, which could fail and prevent the cooling function.",

Fusion research is now accelerating in maturity, moving from solving engineering problems to now building demonstrations and prototypes, it said, with some 98 currently operating fusion experiments and demonstration facilities globally, with 13 under construction and a further 33 planned. The market for commercial fusion has also grown rapidly, with more than 43 private fusion companies operating globally, attracting more than CAD8.2 billion (USD6 billion) in funding.",

CNL operates the laboratories on behalf of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL).",
            "It also announced the expansion of its Canadian Nuclear Research Initiative programme, which enables collaborative research projects with advanced nuclear reactor vendors through a cost-shared model to include other forms of clean energy, to include a \"larger focus\" on fusion-based research and development.",

        "text": [
            "Holtec International has unveiled the schedule for its proposed consolidated interim storage facility (CISF) for used nuclear fuel, with start-up slated for 2020. Holtec sees the facility, to be built in south-eastern New Mexico, as the only solution being put forward to deal with the USA's 70,000 tonnes of used nuclear fuel that is currently located in 35 states and at about 70 sites.",
            "In April, Holtec and Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance (ELEA) announced the signing of a memorandum of agreement covering the design, licensing, construction and operation of the facility that is to be modelled on Holtec's HI-STORM UMAX dry storage system. ELEA will provide the land and local logistics support, including existing environmental characterization data.",
            "yesterday, Holtec International senior vice president and chief nuclear officer Pierre Oneid said the company would submit its letter of intent for the project to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) next month.",
            "Holtec will request that NRC's used fuel management office opens a Part 72 docket which, Oneid said, \"will serve as a letter of intent that will make its way to NRC in August\". Part 72 refers to licensing requirements for the independent storage of used nuclear fuel, high-level radioactive waste, and reactor-related greater than Class C waste.",
            "That will mean a pre-application meeting with NRC can be expected by December and an application submittal to the agency by June 2016, Oneid said. \"We expect, based on past experience and on our discussions with NRC, that it is reasonable to put a date like October 2018 for the safety evaluation report,\" he added.",
            "The licence might then be issued in January 2019, with the first phase of construction starting in April 2019. Operation of the facility could then begin a year later.",
            "Oneid said CISF is a \"wiser approach\" to dealing with the USA's commercial high-level nuclear waste, not least because some storage is currently in the most densely populated areas of the country. Twelve decontamination and decommissioning sites in particular want to turn themselves back to greenfield land, but cannot until the high-level waste is moved, Oneid said.",
            "Transportation of used nuclear fuel and high-level waste is \"proven safe\", he said, since thousands of tonnes of it have been transported around the USA for the past 40 years \"without a single significant incident\". In addition, radioactivity \"decreases rapidly with time\", with gamma and heat decay, he said.",
            "The US government is legally responsible for developing a long-term disposal strategy for used nuclear fuel. From 1992 until 2009, that strategy had been the Yucca Mountain repository. The Department of Energy (DOE) announced a new waste disposal strategy in early 2013, envisaging a series of interim stores until a permanent underground disposal facility is ready for service around 2048.",
            "Breach of contracts associated with termination of the Yucca Mountain project incurs a DOE settlement fund payment of $20 billion by 2020 from the US Treasury, Oneid said, with a further cost after that date of about $500 million per year until a CISF or repository is built.",
            "US taxpayers are paying for the fact that \"decisions have not been made\" on dealing with used nuclear fuel, Oneid said, and \"we want to dispel the argument that there are no solutions\".",
            "The 1000-acre (405-hectare) site, mid-way between Hobbs and Carlsbad, which ELEA originally purchased for the DOE's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, is a remote, geologically stable, dry location with existing infrastructure, including rail. It also has a pre-existing and robust scientific and nuclear operations workforce, Oneid said, with the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant to the south and, to the east, International Isotopes Inc, Louisiana Energy Services and Waste Control Specialists.",
            "\"If there is a perfect place on earth for the CISF that would be it,” Oneid said, adding that the facility would require just 60 of the site's 1000 acres.",
            "Holtec is in the process of licensing its HI-STORM UMAX (Holtec International STORage Module Universal MAXimum security) technology to store not only its own canisters, Oneid said, \"but any in use today\" in the USA.",
            "\"We have more than seven dockets as Certificates of Compliance with NRC and also have certificates for transporting casks that exist today, so that if we as a country can get behind the solution we're offering, then we could start transportation immediately,\" he said.",
            "In addition to the safety and security features of the CISF design using HI-STORM UMAX - for example, it is below waist height, making it inconspicuous and providing a clear view of the entire facility - it enables retrieval of the stored fuel within 4-8 hours.",
            "\"We are designing it to be able to retrieve at any point, whether one year or 50 years from now,\" Oneid said. The technology is also economically desirable since it has already been constructed, at Missouri's Callaway nuclear power plant. In December, Southern California Edison selected HI-STORM UMAX for storing used nuclear fuel from the decommissioned San Onofre plant.",
            "There are therefore no technological impediments, he said, to the proposed CISF, \"which we see as a staging facility on the way to permanent storage\".",
            "Asked what he saw then as the main challenges to the project, Oneid said \"political support is going to be the number one hurdle\", although local government backing in New Mexico is not seen as an issue.",
            "That hurdle will be no surprise to anyone \"who is no stranger to the Yucca Mountain situation\", he said, noting that the US Senate is to hold a hearing on the storage of used nuclear fuel on 4 October.",
            "On the question of whether the CISF could stimulate new reactor construction projects in the USA, Oneid said that Holtec is actively pursuing the small modular reactor program. He noted that one of the biggest hurdles for the four units under construction today in the country is the \"contentious\" issue of high-level waste storage.",
            "For the CISF, Holtec could draw on its experience of private fuel storage, Oneid said. Without local support, any such project is \"a futile exercise\", he said. \"We are actively trying to define what 'consent' is and pursuing that to a T.\" An \"interesting block\" on licensing, he said, was the effort Holtec had had to make to prove the safety of HI-STORM UMAX against an F-16 crash. Oneid was referring to Holtec's announcement in January 2013 that the USA's first NRC licensed CISF, planned for the Goshute reservation in Skull Valley, Utah, by Private Fuel Storage, had ceased due to opposition from the Department of Interior.",
            "Asked who would ultimately own the fuel stored at the proposed CISF in New Mexico, Oneid said Holtec had started unofficial talks with the DOE. \"We will surely soon have official talks with them on a contract whereby the DOE will hold the title to the fuel.\""

            "Preserving existing nuclear capacity and preparing to build large amounts of new nuclear capacity in the next decade are strategic imperatives for the USA, the Nuclear Energy Institute has told the US Department of Energy.",
            "The NEI called for reforms to electricity markets and a systematic effort to create the conditions necessary to deploy advanced reactor technologies in comments submitted to the DOE, as it prepares the next instalment of its Quadrennial Energy Review (QER). \"A continuing, growing contribution from nuclear energy is essential to produce needed baseload electricity at stable prices and to sustain reductions in emissions of carbon and other pollutants,\" it said.",
            "The QER process was established by presidential memorandum in 2014 and aims to engage federal agencies and outside stakeholders while enabling federal government to translate policy goals into a set of analytically based, integrated actions for proposed investments over a four-year planning horizon. The first QER, published in 2015, examined the USA's infrastructure for energy transmission, storage, and distribution, including liquid and natural gas pipelines, the electricity grid, and transport links. The second instalment will focus on the electricity system to produce a set of findings and policy recommendations to help guide modernization of the grid and ensure its continued reliability, safety, security, affordability, and environmental performance in the period to 2040. It is due to be released later this year.",
            "In its 58-page submission, the NEI recommended that the QER should begin by developing an inventory of challenges facing the US electric power sector. Fuel and technology diversity - essential for a robust and resilient system - is at risk of being lost; increasing dependence on natural gas for electricity generation, thereby exposing consumers to price volatility and loss of reliability; the failure of merchant markets to provide the price signals necessary to stimulate investment in new capacity the continued operation of existing capacity; and \"significant changes\" to the electricity landscape over the next few decades as much of today's generating capacity reaches retirement age.",
            "It drew particular attention to the costs of shutting down existing power plants. The negative effects of reactor closures - 14 units have been shut down or announced their closure in recent years - are already being felt in terms of loss of fuel and technology diversity, higher electricity costs and higher carbon emissions, it said. It described the \"progressive loss\" of fuel and technology diversity and the \"ever-increasing dependence on natural gas\" as a \"disturbing trend\".",
            "Capacity from zero-emissions nuclear plants which have closed down is usually replaced with carbon-emitting gas-fired plants, so shutting nuclear plants results in higher emissions. Renewable sources lack the scale and, thanks to their intermittency, the reliability of nuclear which provides dispatchable baseload power to the grid. The NEI said that nuclear electricity, with its unique attributes and value to the grid, should be seen as a \"premium product\".",
            "The NEI emphasized that short-term, unsustainable, price signals rather than long-term market fundamentals are the reason for many recent premature closures of nuclear power plants. \"Market conditions are forcing companies to make decisions that our nation will regret for the next 20 or 30 years, or longer,\" it said.",
            "The NEI outlined a number of ways in which it said federal and state policymakers could help to preserve existing nuclear generating assets. These included providing incentives for capacity; minimizing the effects of subsidies by providing tax credits to place carbon-free nuclear on a level playing field with carbon-free renewables; properly valuing nuclear output for its \"uniquely valuable\" attributes; and considering adopting state-level zero-carbon clean energy standards. Existing plants wanting to secure a second licence renewal could be supported through financial incentives and a predictable and more efficient regulatory regime, it said.",
            "It called for the USA to \"capitalize\" on lessons learned during construction new reactors in at Vogtle in Georgia Summer in South Carolina. When Vogtle and Summer. \"Since the licensing process will have been tested on these first projects, and since the next projects will have already received and banked their [construction and operating licences] for a design that is already certified, it should be possible to reduce time-to-market to the time required for construction,\" it said.",
            "The government should also do more to help support new nuclear technologies, the NEI said. It said the DOE's current Licensing Technical Support program - a 50-50 cost-shared program aiming to carry a single small modular reactor through NRC design certification - was not sufficient and called for funding to take \"at least\" two reactor designs through the process.",
            "Non-light water advanced reactors could be deployed commercially by 2030 if government and industry worked together to solve challenges including financing, NEI said. It called for two or more advanced non-light water reactors to be demonstrated by 2025, with at least two designs commercially available for construction in the US by 2030. \"Given the funding needs, in parallel with reforms to the NRC licensing process to accommodate advanced, non-light-water technologies, industry and government must start immediately to create a new, durable platform to finance advanced technology development,\" it said."

            "winning essay*, the two young engineers write that this new system \"stood on three pillars\" - a coordinated European strategy , technological developments and a new nuclear message.",
            "A coordinated European strategy",
            "The solution was to extend the scope of the Euratom Treaty in several areas, with the aim of fulfilling the lofty ambitions set out in the original 1957 treaty. This aimed to strengthen the European nuclear market by reducing barriers to entry, and increasing strategic cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.",
            "Nuclear research and development was targeted in three ways - funding nuclear innovation aimed at cost reductions; developing revolutionary technologies, including molten salt reactors; and creating national centres of excellence for research, with areas of expertise identified and prioritised in each nuclear nation, and research budgets 'pooled' across European states.",
            "To address the issue of financing nuclear new build, in 2019 the European Commission instructed the European Investment Bank to commence direct investment in nuclear power plant construction projects. This effectively removed the limit on Euratom loans which could be provided, enabling developers to access finance more readily and affordably than possible on the private market. Developers bid to be permitted by government to construct Gen III+ plants, giving nations control over the technologies that were built within their borders. Once construction was completed, the state effectively bought the plant from the developer, refinancing the project prior to offering shorter term 'contracts for difference' for the plant's operation. This generated competition between operators and effectively separated the benefit of guaranteed price from construction risk.",
            "Alongside this, a significant change was made to the European regulatory environment. A new pan-European regulatory body was established to provide a first point of contact for European pre-licensing support to developers, and to provide a mechanism by which harmonisation of the regulatory environment could be progressed. This aimed to: provide pre-licensing support to national regulators and developers of new designs, through a central regulatory body; increase collaboration of regulators across Europe; and develop regulatory expertise in new nuclear nations through the provision of training as part of Europe’s export offering.",
            "A third development was to coordinate exports. Following the successful rollout of Gen III+ reactors in the UK in the 2020s, and the French new build program of the 2030s, European leaders were determined to take advantage of the nuclear construction and manufacturing expertise that had been developed and to not lose these skills again, as had happened in the 1990s and 2000s.",
            "In order to provide a significant value proposition to aspiring nuclear nations of the rapidly developing world, Europe offered its services in an integrated fuel cycle package consisting of: fuel security via access to the Euratom Supply Agency; enrichment provided by Urenco in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK; fuel manufacture, including accident tolerant fuels, developed in the UK; large reactors designed and delivered by France; Small Modular Reactor plants designed and delivered by the UK, along with advanced manufacturing capabilities developed at the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre; construction and project management experience offered by a consortium of Franco-British organisations; regulator training provided by the European pre-licensing body; and export credit issued by the European Investment Bank.",
            "In order to allow the European offering to compete with established nuclear exporters (Russia, China and the United States), a coordinated effort was undertaken within Europe to reduce the challenges of export control. This allowed more open sharing of nuclear information and resources with Europe, allowing it to present itself as a larger unified exporter.",
            "Technological developments",
            "Along with reforms in research, finance and regulation, developments in technology were key in allowing nuclear power to flourish in the decades following the signing of the expanded Euratom treaty: emergence of SMRs and their application in 'load following'; integration of SMRs with increased renewable energy penetration; and progress toward establishment of a European 'super grid'.",
            "International concerns about the commercial viability of large nuclear power plants encouraged the rapid development of SMR plants across Europe in the 2020s, due to their more affordable capital requirements. As these financial concerns dissipated, and large nuclear new build programs got back on track, SMR developers adapted to fill a complementary role to large nuclear power.",
            "France was able to share its vast experience of load following operations for plants operating between 30% and 100% of rated capacity. This helped to underpin proposals to use extensive load following elsewhere across Europe.",
            "Having led the world in the development of renewable energy technologies, European nations continued to take the lead in a selection of innovative projects which brought together renewable energy and nuclear power in a direct, complementary manner. Large energy utilities came to the fore in this field, bringing their renewable and nuclear energy sectors together to cooperate on single projects. Europe was thus able to position itself as an exporter of associated services and expertise to the rest of the world.",
            "Europe's large-scale expansion of nuclear power had to be supported by a concurrent expansion and reinforcement of electrical distribution networks. This was vital in order to allow the energy sharing that formed an important part of the agreements that underpinned the pan-European fuel cycle.",
            "Three strategies were employed here: enhanced cooperation with renewables; moving focus away from safety; and coordination of communications messages.",
            "Successful cooperation with the renewable energy industry, which traditionally had strong public support, helped to bring the public to view nuclear power in the same light. By demonstrating that nuclear power is working toward the same goal - clean, plentiful, secure, low carbon energy - the public started to realise that the solution to climate and energy security problems lay in a combination of renewable energy AND nuclear power, not renewable energy OR nuclear power.",
            "A significant change in nuclear communications was controversial at first, but proved invaluable. The European Commission requested that the European nuclear energy community cease leading with safety as the key message in public communications. Instead, the industry was sold on its benefits - plentiful and secure low carbon electricity which would prevent a repeat of energy shortages in future. That is not to say that safety became any less of a priority, merely that it was not the focus of external communications, as had become the norm around the turn of the century. Just as a restaurant would not highlight on its menu the absence of rats in its kitchen, the nuclear industry would not lead with a message of safety, keeping that argument in reserve in case the question is asked.",
            "Finally, public communications were coordinated across Europe. Following the lead of the UK's Nuclear Industry Council's workstream, a set of messages to be emphasised when communicating with the public was agreed upon. This brought the benefit of consistency in fact-based messages.",

            "The UK's Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has 53 research projects and proposals amounting to about £1.2 million ($1.5 million) in its Regulatory Research Register for 2016-17, which it published last week.",
            "The ONR is the public body set up under the Energy Act 2013 as the independent, statutory regulator of nuclear safety, nuclear security, and conventional health and safety at nuclear sites. The Act enables ONR to carry out or commission research in connection with its purposes and supports delivery of its vision of being an exemplary regulator, it notes in the report.",
            "Of the 53 it identified, 11 proposals for action this financial year amounted to expenditure of £500,000. A further £48,000 was allocated for attendance and participation in research activities, such as conferences, seminars and other related engagements, together with membership subscriptions for various research topic groups. In previous years, ONR's structural integrity specialism - particularly its graphite research program - was managed as a separate research activity. For 2016-17 this activity has been merged with its wider regulatory research.",
            "ONR's research objectives are contained in its research strategy published in August 2015. This states that ONR will use research to support its independent regulatory decision-making, based on objective scientific and technical understanding of the safety issues. The main objectives of the strategy are to ensure that ONR's inspectors form their regulatory judgements \"confidently and effectively using sound, up-to-date scientific and technical information\".",
            "Potential research needs and opportunities, to achieve ONR's objectives, are identified through its 15 specialisms, including: fault analysis; human and organisational capability; mechanical engineering; radioactive waste/nuclear liabilities; radiation protection and criticality; process and chemical engineering; security; and structural integrity.",
            "Research proposals pass through a selection procedure, utilising defined principles and criteria to screen and prioritise our research proposals and check they are aligned with ONR's strategy. Research proposals carried forward are \"translated into specifications\" and then discussed with ONR's stakeholders, for example, the environment agencies, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, the wider nuclear industry and key research providers.",
            "This \"seeks to deliver maximum value\" from its research activities, ensures duplication of work is avoided and promotes the sharing of good practice as widely as possible, it said. Research proposals that have successfully progressed through this process are added to the Regulatory Research Register.",
            "In the 2016-2017 report, the ONR says the nuclear landscape is \"changing rapidly\", with the nuclear industry poised to expand as plans to design and build several new nuclear power stations and emergent small modular reactor technology develop. With this changing landscape it is important that ONR positions itself to ensure it can adequately meet the challenges, it added.",
            "Research plays a critical role in its understanding of a wide range of complex, often unique challenges, it said. Its research needs differ from many organisations in that they support its independent regulatory decision making and ensure its regulatory processes remain robust, it said. This needs to be based on objective scientific and technical understanding of the safety and security issues that may arise, it added.",
            "Anthony Hart, director of ONR's Technical Division, a role which encompasses ONR's research portfolio, said the annual report includes case studies that \"show how our research strategy has helped support ONR's enabling regulatory approach, in addition to informing the development of relevant good practice\".",
            "The first case study, 'radiation protection risks arising from using non air-fed suits', gained the following \"safety intelligence\", it said: use heart rate monitors with alarms; only ask workers to undertake one entry per day to allow sufficient resting time; ensure good hydration and rehydration is available; tight controls warranted over non air-fed suit activities when using non permeable PVC suits in high temperature environments.",
            "The second, 'graphite core ageing', recommends: identification of inherent uncertainties which are present in predictions of graphite core ageing; advice to ONR in determining whether the licensee has made reasonable assumptions and appropriately accounted for uncertainty in its predictive models of graphite core behaviour; and advice to ONR in determining whether the limits and margins within the licensee's graphite core safety case are adequate to support continued safe operation.",
            "The third, 'prediction of pressurised water reactor fuel behaviour in faults', states that \"it is now feasible to better quantify the uncertainty in critical heat flux for boiling conditions, though further research is needed to do this with precision for dryout\". The ONR now has \"an enhanced objective basis\" for critical assessment of the safety cases for PWR type stations, it said.",
            "The ONR's research evaluation process is still to be finalised, it said, but it is developing a strategy in which it reviews the regulatory impact and value for money when its projects are completed.",
            "\"As we enter a new financial year, our research team will continue to identity ONR's needs to ensure that we are equipped to meet the regulatory challenges arising from the evolving nuclear industry. This will include reviewing our strategy and identifying areas that are framed around innovation and technology,\" it said.",
            "yesterday that, following discussions with licensees and stakeholders, it had \"confirmed the industry were already funding most of the identified work\" and thus of the 53 proposals, ONR had identified 11 for action.",
            "\"These were mainly across Fault Studies (Internal Hazards and Fuel and Core), Chemistry, Structural Integrity and Radiological Protection specialisms,\" he said. \"Since then, three projects have now been completed and findings published. Five are live ongoing contracts or memberships of coordinated research programs”.",
            "RRR-018 - THAI 3 (OECD-NEA program to further investigate issues specific for Water Cooled Reactors under severe accident conditions: fission product behaviour, hydrogen mitigation and combustion);",

            "Ontario's nuclear advantage",
            "Those who enter the workforce in the coming years will be greeted with the opportunity to be a part of one of Canada's most exciting industries, Glenn Thibeault, Ontario's energy minister, told delegates at the Canadian Nuclear Association's Annual Conference & Trade Show, which was held in Ottawa on 23 February.",
            "\"Not only that, but tomorrow's advanced nuclear technology, built right here in Ontario, will play a key role in addressing climate change - our generation's greatest challenge.",
            "Thanks to the refurbishment and continued operation of our nuclear fleet - Pickering, Darlington, and Bruce - Ontario will continue to benefit from a clean and stable supply of electricity both today and well into the future.",
            "And we are well-positioned for the inevitable transition towards a low-carbon economy. This is where - to quote from the CNA's recent public awareness campaign - 'the nuclear advantage' comes into play.",
            "Nuclear is the backbone of Ontario's energy system. That's because it currently supplies more than 60% of the power Ontarians use each and every day. And because of nuclear energy's undisputed role as a reliable source of baseload power. Nuclear energy is also a competitively priced source of power. In Ontario, for example, the average cost of nuclear energy is about seven cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity, making nuclear energy one of the cheapest sources of power for our province. Equally important, nuclear energy is free of greenhouse gas emissions.",
            "The use of nuclear energy is allowing Ontario to move closer to meeting its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in its Action Plan against climate change. Emissions-free nuclear energy played an important role in the ecological shift in the electricity grid. This same network will meet the demand for more electric vehicles on Ontario's roads. An electrical network that is now 96% without emissions. But that's not all. Thanks in large part to nuclear energy and its obvious ability to provide Ontarians with reliable base energy, at any given time, Ontario was able to eliminate coal-fired electricity generation in 2014.",
            "At that time, Al Gore hailed this precedent-setting achievement as the \"largest greenhouse gas reduction initiative in North America\". And with the elimination of dirty coal-fired generation in Ontario, coupled with forward-thinking investments in clean energy generation, Ontario’s air quality dramatically improved. The figures speak for themselves.",
            "In 2005, Ontario had 53 smog days. On those days kids who live with severe asthma couldn’t play outside because of the serious risks posed by poor air quality. Now fast forward to last year, Ontario reported zero smog advisories. This significant improvement in our air quality should be a point of pride for Ontarians. It has improved our quality of life. And it has reduced a serious strain on our healthcare system. Both air pollution hospitalisations and air pollution deaths are way down. Ending coal generation has not only been a big environmental success, but an enormous public health success.",
            "But the benefits of nuclear energy have a significant economic impact as well. For example, Ontario’s globally-recognized nuclear supply chain supports over 200 companies and some 60,000 jobs. These highly skilled, good-paying jobs, in turn, help grow the economy at both the local and regional level over the long term. The refurbishment of the Bruce and Darlington Nuclear Generation Stations provide good examples of this.",
            "According to an economic impact study conducted by a consortium of our energy sector partners, Bruce Power will create and sustain 22,000 direct and indirect jobs annually, while contributing $4 billion to Ontario’s economy. This also provides a huge boost to the local economy with suppliers establishing a local presence and building up the community in the Bruce-Grey-Huron region.",
            "Darlington's refurbishment - once complete - and in operation over the next 30 years will boost Ontario's GDP by approximately CAD90 billion dollars. Added to this, Darlington's refurbishment will generate an average of 14,200 jobs annually. This includes 2600 onsite jobs at Darlington.",
            "Now, earlier this month, my team was able to celebrate with OPG an important milestone at Darlington. Unit 2's refurbishment is 50% complete. And is on time and on budget. Darlington's success to date is a testament of the good work done by OPG, the Ontario government, and the nuclear energy sector in keeping this project on track. This collaborative work involved advanced preparation, the sharing of knowledge amongst various parties and multiple levels of oversight. In addition to the strong support provided by an assortment of host communities.",
            "As the minister of energy, I would say that the refurbishment of the four reactors at the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station, as well as the six reactors at the Bruce Kincardine Nuclear Generating Station, will not only provide 9800 low-cost, reliable and emission-free megawatts, but with the deferral of the Pickering plant closure in 2024, reaffirm that nuclear energy is undeniably a central pillar of Ontario's energy future.",
            "Our commitment to nuclear energy, and particularly to these refurbishments, is also emphasised in our long-term Energy Plan, entitled Ensuring Fairness and Choice. More specifically, this plan highlights the important role that the nuclear sector has played - and will continue to play - in innovation in energy and non-energy applications.",
            "Ontario, with its knowledge of the nuclear field, is a pioneer in nuclear research and medicine. Think of the production of isotopes, which help save the lives of millions of people around the world. And that's not all.",
            "Ontario is also creating new export opportunities for nuclear innovations in a wide variety of fields that include small modular reactor technology, nuclear fuel research and hydrogen. I should add: this re-affirmation of nuclear energy extends beyond our Long-Term Energy Plan.",
            "Last November, in a report issued by the Financial Accountability of Ontario, our province’s independent financial watchdog stated: \"There is no alternative clean, emissions-free generation that could effectively replace nuclear generation at a comparable cost for Ontario's ratepayers.\" As our government prioritises clean, reliable and affordable electricity, this is a strong endorsement. And proves, once again, the critical role our nuclear sector plays.",
            "So, I would like to thank the CNA for its work on the 'Ontario Nuclear Advantage' campaign helping to spread awareness of the value of nuclear. In this room, we all know the advantage of nuclear power. And, as Ontario's experience shows, the strong support of host communities is essential. We all must do our part to continue to promote the benefits of nuclear power as a solution to future energy and environmental priorities.",
            "Priority number one is to continue our success with refurbishments, demonstrating that with proper preparation, oversight, and cooperation that we can successfully execute on these large infrastructure projects, protecting ratepayers and creating benefits for future generations in in Ontario.",
            "This will continue to be a top priority for me as minister, and I know that virtually everyone here has a part to play. I look forward to continuing to work with you all to ensure that a decade from now, we can return to this forum to announce that all of Ontario’s nuclear refurbishments were completed on time and on budget, for the benefit of future ratepayers and all Ontarians.\""

            "The UK's nuclear industry has unanimously welcomed the Sector Deal, which Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark outlined at the nuclear-licensed Trawsfynydd site in North Wales. The document, which includes GBP200 million (USD262 million) in funding for the sector, was developed by the Nuclear Industry Council (NIC) - whose membership is drawn from across energy, manufacturing, engineering, science and research - in partnership with the government.",
            "Clark (second from right) unveiling the Sector Deal (Image: UK Government Wales)",
            "The NIC unveiled its proposals for a nuclear Sector Deal in December last year, following the government's publication of its Industrial Strategy white paper, which highlights the role of nuclear energy in the UK.",
            "Clark said it is a \"commitment by the sector to work collectively, with support from government, to deliver on the Industrial Strategy, drive clean growth throughout the economy and make civil nuclear power an integral part of the UK's energy future\".",
            "Its key elements include: up to GBP56 million for research and development for advanced modular reactors; GBP86 million for a national fusion technology platform at Culham, Oxfordshire; GBP40 million for a facility to support the design of advanced nuclear technologies; GBP32 million for an advanced manufacturing and construction programme; and GBP30 million for a new national supply chain programme.",
            "It also outlines a commitment from industry to reduce the cost of new nuclear build projects by 30% by 2030 and the cost of decommissioning old nuclear sites by 20% by 2030. In addition, it says there will be a new review to look at ways to accelerate the clean-up of nuclear 'legacy' sites. It also makes a commitment to increasing gender diversity in the civil nuclear workforce with a target of 40% women in nuclear by 2030.",
            "Tom Greatrex, CEO of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: \"This ambitious deal between industry and government will ensure nuclear plays a key role in providing the UK's low-carbon energy supply for the future, maximising opportunities in overseas markets, leveraging technology and innovation and increasing competitiveness.\"",
            "The Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (Nuclear AMRC) will have an important role to play in delivering the deal, its CEO, Andrew Storer, said.",
            "\"We will work with our industry and research partners to demonstrate the benefits of advanced techniques and technologies for manufacturers of all sizes. We will also play a leading role in the new national programme to enhance the capabilities of the UK's supply chain, expanding our established Fit for Nuclear programme and building on the success of Civil Nuclear Sharing in Growth.",
            "Assystem, which this week signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Nuclear AMRC, said the GBP200 million commitment to drive down costs of nuclear energy will help increase industry competitiveness and in turn attract investment; meaning cheaper energy bills for customers. Tom Jones, the company's vice president for international business development, added that small modular reactors (SMRs) \"are the future\" and the new Nuclear Innovation Programme with the Welsh government will help \"drive and advance\" new nuclear technologies.",
            "The Sector Deal also lends \"clear support\" for the UK's nuclear fuel capability as well as micro nuclear reactors, Thomas Haeberle, CEO of URENCO, said.",
            "\"This support boosts the robustness of the UK's fuel offering to international markets and helps to ensure that the country continues to act as a global leader in this sector,\" he said. \"We, along with our consortium partners, are also delighted that our micro nuclear reactor, U-Battery, has received the green light to progress to Phase 1 of the government's AMR Programme. During Phase 1 we will produce a feasibility study, which will make the commercial and technical case for U-Battery.\"",
            "Horizon Nuclear Power - Hitachi's UK subsidiary that is developing two advanced boiling water reactors at Wylfa Newydd in Wales - said the Sector Deal \"clearly sets out the opportunities and the challenges for the industry\", for example, building the skills base needed and the commitment to increase gender diversity. \"We look forward to playing our part,\" CEO Duncan Hawthorne, said.",
            "The Heart of the South West Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) said the funding from government would lead to further job creation. Its chairman, Steve Hindley, said: “We have GBP50 billion worth of commercial opportunities to realise in this sector across the region; the partners have worked closely together to create this deal and stand ready to deliver.\" The LEP launched a business support service to enable small and medium-sized businesses take up the supply chain opportunities from EDF Energy's project to build two EPRs at Hinkley Point C in Somerset, England.",
            "Matt Rooney, engineering policy adviser at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said the new thermal hydraulics facility in Anglesey will bolster the UK's nuclear research and development capabilities.",

In making the announcement at the existing nuclear site at Trawsfynydd, the Secretary of State highlighted its suitability for hosting the UK's first SMR, he added.",
            "The GMB trade union also highlighted the potential for SMRs, calling for them to be UK designed and manufactured and for their export potential to be realised.

            "Government support is required in order to stimulate private investment in the development of small-scale nuclear power projects in the UK, according to a report produced by an independent advisory group.",
            "Urenco's U-Battery micro nuclear reactor is one of the SMR designs proposed for deployment in the UK (Image: Urenco)",
            "The UK's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy set up an Expert Finance Working Group (EFWG) in January as part of the Advanced Nuclear Technologies initiatives announced by Energy Minister Richard Harrington in December 2017. The remit of the group was to independently advise the government on the potential for small nuclear reactor projects to raise private investment in the UK that could enable their future commercial deployment.",
            "The EFWG on Small Nuclear Reactors yesterday released its findings and recommendations in a report, titled",
            "Market framework for financing small nuclear",
            "The chair of the group, Fiona Reilly, said in the preface to the report: \"Despite the increase in global activity and interest in small nuclear there remains a market failure in getting technologies and projects to commercial delivery, and in particular in securing sufficient financing for projects from the private sector.\"",
            "She added, \"In developing its recommendations for a market framework, the EFWG thoroughly reviewed the risks associated with small nuclear, considering who is best able to manage such risks, the consequences of the risks and how the consequences can be managed.\"",
            "The report notes that small nuclear projects range from micro-generation projects through to 600 MWe reactors. The costs of such projects range from GBP100 million (USD129 million) to GBP2.5 billion. As such, each project will have its own structure and risks. However, the group said it believes that its recommendations apply to all the different potential small reactors being considered for development by 2030.",
            "According to the EFWG, some of the barriers to small nuclear projects which the UK government can assist with are \"relatively straightforward\", such as making sites and Generic Design Assessment (GDA) slots available.",
            "\"Some require the same support that any industry needs to bring innovation forward,\" it said. \"Others are more fundamental around a lack of understanding/misunderstandings around nuclear and the need to get the first projects across the line to create the market.\"",
            "The group makes a number of recommendations on how the government can help create the right market framework for the commercialisation of small nuclear projects. It says, \"Government should enable the small nuclear sector through a clear policy and a market framework, rather than down-selecting technologies.\" The report also calls for the government to work with stakeholders from the energy, nuclear and finance sectors to develop a common understanding of the risks associated with such projects.",
            "\"For those technologies capable of being brought to market by 2030, government should focus its resources on bringing first-of-a-kind projects to market by reducing the cost of capital and sharing risks,\" the EFWG suggests. \"This could be done through assisting with the financing of such projects through a new infrastructure fund and/or direct equity and/or government guarantees. The government could also provide funding support mechanisms such as a Contract for Difference, a Power Purchase Agreement or potentially a Regulated Asset Base model.\"",
            "The group also recommends the government works with the country's nuclear regulators - the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the Environment Agency - to review regulatory processes to develop \"an optimised and flexible approach and through the Generic Design Assessment process allow the market to down-select technologies\".",
            "The government should also establish an advanced manufacturing supply chain initiative - as it did with offshore wind - to bring forward existing and new manufacturing capability in the UK and \"to challenge the market on the requirement for nuclear specific items, particularly balance of plant, thereby reducing the costs of nuclear and the perceived risks associated with it\".",
            "\"In short, the EFWG notes that private finance will not come forward to develop first-of-a-kind small nuclear projects without some government support in helping to remove the barriers to the development,\" the report states. \"By following the recommendations set out, government would be creating a similar environment to the early days of wind and solar commercial development in the UK by creating a market whereby the small nuclear sector can develop and over time bring in more and more private sector financial involvement to create a sustainable industry and to in turn bring down the costs of energy.\"",
            "The UK government launched the first phase of an small modular reactor (SMR) competition in 2016 to identify the best value SMR design for the UK. A decision on how to proceed with the second phase has yet to be made.",
            "Industry welcomes recommendation",
            "\"This report confirms small reactors have real potential to be a financially viable addition to the existing nuclear programme,\" said Peter Haslam, head of policy at the Nuclear Industry Association. \"Not only could small reactors bring value for money to the consumer, they also have the potential to create a lucrative export market, with a major benefit for British engineering companies and the wider supply chain.\"",
            "He added, \"The report sets out how small reactors can be cost competitive, and we hope the financial sector will recognise this. Small reactors could make a significant contribution to bolstering energy security while tackling climate change, and we hope to see government taking forward the recommendations as soon as possible.\"",
            "World Nuclear Association Director General Agneta Rising said: \"We welcome this report's support for the development of small modular reactors to enable them to contribute to the goal of nuclear generation providing 25% of the world's electricity supply by 2050.\"",
            "She added, \"The report's recognition that a market approach is needed that will allow small modular reactors to compete in a level playing field with other low-carbon generation, and that regulatory processes need to adopt an optimised and flexible approach, are consistent with the reforms that are urgently required, as identified by global nuclear industry's Harmony programme.\"",

            "Changes in energy policy, including in the USA, are needed in order to achieve the aims of the Harmony Programme, writes Josh Freed, who spoke on this topic at World Nuclear Association Symposium 2018 in September.",
            "Policies changes may be required for a small nuclear reactor to provide power to remote Arctic communities (Image: Third Way)",
            "Climate impacts are intensifying by the day and the global nuclear sector must do more to position itself as a part of a larger coalition of technologies that are being mobilised in the climate fight. This will require new reactor types in a variety of sizes, but technology innovation alone will not be enough. The nuclear sector must also innovate new policy approaches, new business strategies, and develop better ways to communicate and engage communities who want access to nuclear technologies.",
            "The World Nuclear Association's Harmony Programme sets a roadmap for how we might achieve these non-technical, yet absolutely essential, forms of innovation - and ultimately position nuclear energy technologies to play a major role in the global climate response. Harmony prescribes three main policy actions to reach the goal of 1000 GW of new nuclear generation by 2050:",
            "to establish a level playing field for all low-carbon energy sources;",
            "to support a harmonised regulatory process globally; and",
            "to create an effective safety paradigm that helps contextualise the risk of all energy sources.",
            "Developing policies to achieve these objectives and support the growth of nuclear energy is a challenge. Even in the USA, a pioneer of nuclear energy technology and long-time leader in the global nuclear market, federal policy has struggled to keep up alongside a",
            "burgeoning advanced reactor community",
            ". As home to this ambitious group of reactor developers, the USA has a unique responsibility on the world stage to continue to set the bar for safety and security, and to enable the commercialisation and export of these new technologies. There are several efforts underway that could make it easier for America to do its part toward Harmony's goal, and some outstanding challenges the US will need to address to continue to be a provider of nuclear energy technologies globally.",
            "Leveling the playing field for all low-carbon resources may be the most pivotal action nations can take toward promoting nuclear energy. It's also one of the trickiest to address in the USA, where the party controlling the legislative and executive branches of government is hesitant to acknowledge the reality of climate change - let alone commit to solutions.",
            "There is some evidence of movement on this front. A recent carbon tax bill made a big splash in the American press because it was sponsored by a Republican policymaker. Though a fair price on carbon emissions would be the ultimate bulldozer to level the energy playing field, this kind of sweeping, climate-centric policy stands no chance in Washington while Republicans control the Congress and the White House. The real action, as it turns out, might be at the sub-national level.",
            "As climate-forward states take a harder look at exactly how they're going to achieve their emissions goals, they seem to be realizing the value of additional carbon-free resources beyond renewables. Massachusetts, a historically progressive state on clean energy and climate issues, adjusted its renewable portfolio standard in 2017, adding a tier that would allow new nuclear plants to contribute to a low-carbon mandate covering over one-third of the state's power in 2050. And California, a global front-runner on renewables, is considering a similar clean energy standard model that would let the state take advantage of nuclear and carbon capture as it aims to completely decarbonize its power sector. Even some conservative states are giving this option a look. In right-leaning Arizona, discussion is heating up around an 80% clean energy standard that would be open to non-renewable sources of carbon-free power like nuclear.",
            "On the regulatory front, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission is taking important steps to modernise the licensing process for advanced nuclear reactors by shifting to a risk-informed approach like Canada and the UK. A",
            "a structured, staged review of advanced reactors",
            "that can help inform licensing project plans for developers in the licensing process going forward. A bipartisan coalition of Congressional champions have",
            "introduced legislation to codify this approach",
            "and there is a new push by nuclear advocates to",
            "streamline the export process",
            ". Both of these efforts, if successful, will help harmonize the US regulatory approach to better serve countries who are hungry for low-carbon energy in the global marketplace.",
            "Putting the risks associated with nuclear in proper context alongside other energy resource risks is also extremely important. We are seeing this play out most vividly when comparing nuclear to the climate risks carried by fossil fuel use. When confronted with the potential closure of existing plants, states, local communities, and environmental organisations have done detailed assessments of the resulting damage from continued fossil generation and the locking-in of additional natural gas infrastructure. This has led a surprising number of them to acknowledge (often for the first time) the value of nuclear energy. These stakeholders have successfully secured policies in states like New York, Illinois, New Jersey, and Connecticut to support nuclear reactors at risk of premature closure. That sentiment for the existing fleet is starting to spread to communities that see new reactors as a way to shift away from that risk.",
            "For instance, dozens of US communities are assessing the environmental costs of coal, and choosing nuclear energy to support their future energy needs. The Utah Associated Municipal Power Association (UAMPS), is a public, member-led energy cooperative in the intermountain west region of the US. Their members, small towns and cities with municipal utilities that purchase power through UAMPS, are in the process of setting up America's first commercial small modular reactor project. When they were faced with a decision on whether to stick with coal or to go nuclear, they chose nuclear. In partnership with NuScale and the US Department of Energy, these communities will be the early adopters of a potentially game-changing nuclear energy system. Their innovative, community-driven business model could be a transformative example for others as smaller reactors reach niche markets with smaller energy needs across the globe.",
            "To make headway on the critical goals set forth by the Harmony Programme nuclear innovation cannot just be left to the engineers. Harmony's success will depend on an all-hands-on-deck effort across the nuclear community - in business, government, and how we spread the word about nuclear energy to reach the 2050 goals and mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.",
            "To learn from some of nuclear energy’s top executives and influencers where the story is headed,",
            "for the World Nuclear Association Symposium taking place in London this September.",

The target requires the country to bring all its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, compared with the previous target of an at least 80% reduction from 1990 levels. It has already reduced emissions by 42% while growing the economy by 72%.",

The worrying effects of climate change, such as heat waves, wildfires and flooding are already occurring at an alarming rate and will have a huge impact on future generations,\" Lamb said. \"Throughout our inquiry, it was worrying to hear that although the government may be ambitious when it comes to reducing carbon emissions, it is not putting the policies in place which are needed to achieve those targets. We need to see the government put its words into actions.\"",

            "Lamb said: \"The rate of deployment of several key low-carbon technologies is significantly lower than what is required to meet the government's ambitions, and various stakeholders expressed concern at the current and projected rate of progress of the UK's decarbonisation.

            "In July, BEIS opened for consultation its assessment of a new financing model aimed at reducing the cost of new nuclear power plant projects by having consumers pay upfront through their energy bills. A solution is needed urgently, it said, because nuclear energy is seen as a vital part of the government's commitment to cutting the country's carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Seven of the UK's eight existing nuclear plants are set to be retired by 2030.",

            "Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the UK Nuclear Industry Association, welcomed the committee's conclusion that new nuclear is needed to reach the government's net zero by 2050 target, noting that nuclear consistently provides reliable, low-carbon energy and already supplies half of the UK’s clean electricity. He too stressed the need for progress in financing new projects.",
            "\"It is imperative government urgently puts in place the necessary regulatory and financial frameworks to enable the development of new power stations - both to replace our current fleet, which will mostly retire by 2030, and to provide the firm power element of our future mix which the Committee on Climate Change has demonstrated will be required to successfully meet net zero,\" Greatrex said.",

            "In a statement to accompany its new report, the Science and Technology Committee said it welcomed the government's decision to strengthen its long-term emissions reduction target, to effectively eliminate all emissions by 2050, but noted that the Committee on Climate Change - an independent, statutory body established under the Climate Change Act 2008 - had warned the UK was \"not even on course\" to meet its existing legally binding targets for 2023 to 2032. That committee's report on clean growth highlights that urgent government action is needed to reverse the current policy trend of cut backs and slow progress, it said.",
            "The report published today lists 10 main areas in which government policy to support the implementation of low-carbon technology has been delayed, cut back or undermined carbon reductions. One of these areas, it says, is that the 'feed-in tariff' for low-carbon power generation \"was closed\". Another is that onshore wind and large-scale solar power have been excluded from the financial support mechanism available to other renewable power technologies since 2017, and planning permission for onshore wind farms has also been made more difficult to obtain since 2015. A third is that the government’s new White Paper on 'The future of the energy market' was due to be published in \"early\" 2019, but has not yet been published.",

            "The nuclear industry cannot assume that the words and phrases it commonly understands as scientific or engineering terms have positive connotations for the public, writes Neil Alexander, principal consultant at Bucephalus Consulting.",
            "Neil Alexander, principal consultant at Bucephalus Consulting",
            "\"We have all heard that a picture paints a thousand words. This should not be surprising because our mind was always designed to handle images, the face of our mother, the outline of a lion in the savannah, the route from our cave to the berry bush. Images have always been essential to our survival and are bound to be powerful.",
            "Less appreciated is the power of words to create mental pictures and how that affects perceptions of nuclear power. The power of words should not be a surprise either as language was developed so that we could describe things to each other in the absence of an image and then further developed to describe things, such as emotions or complex principles, by creating virtual images.",
            "Linguists talk about words having two meanings, denotative and connotative. Denotative is the dictionary definition and connotative the image that the word creates. Scientists and engineers are taught to write denotatively, conveying information, while poets and journalists typically work with connotation, painting pictures for the mind. While denotative meanings may be correct, it is the images that hold the authority. They can even  make the words more powerful than swords.",
            "And here lies one of the nuclear industry's challenges, unfortunate imagery. Another, implied discrimination, is linked. We will come to that later.",
            "For now, let's study some very real examples of the language/image issues.",
            "Used fuel is described by many outside the industry, and too many within it, as waste. Look waste up in the dictionary and you will find one meaning is 'an unusable or unwanted substance'. Presently, used fuel is unwanted and so it can denotatively be called waste. But the image created by the word waste is not one of carefully engineered racks of shiny fuel assemblies; it is of the waste we see in our everyday lives: trash. That isn't a good image.",
            "Meanwhile, allowing it to be described as waste implicitly allows a place where it is stored to be described as a dump because a dump is 'a place where people are allowed to leave their waste'. However, the use of the word, regardless of its legitimacy, creates a very unfortunate image. There is no meaning of the word 'dump' that is nice. Quarterbacks get dumped, unwanted products get dumped, toxic materials get dumped and places that are so nasty that you don’t want to visit them are described as dumps. Dumps are disorderly, unpleasant, smelly and visually, whether in the mind or in reality, unattractive.",
            "Take a fear of radiation and stir it up with an image of trash randomly strewn around on the ground and it shouldn't be a surprise that people get upset when a 'nuclear waste dump' is going to be built near where they live. All an anti-nuclear campaigner has to do is to use those words, to create that image, and their work is all but done. I wouldn’t want a nuclear waste dump near me. I wouldn’t want one anywhere on earth.",
            "I wouldn't mind a used fuel repository though.",
            "And it's not just on waste where choosing the right word to use has been a problem. Nuclear operators aspire to making something go critical but for the general population that word brings up an image of something going disastrously wrong, likely a relative or friend about to die. While the nuclear industry knows that radioactive decay is a good thing, what image does the word decay create? It's not a good one. It certainly doesn't connote a process so precisely predictable that we set our watches by it.",
            "Unfortunately, the nuclear industry seems to have not only allowed unhelpful words to creep into its lexicon but to have done its best to pick scary words whenever the opportunity arose. While the intention was likely to aid people in their understanding by alluding to something they already understood, often it was without consideration of the consequences. Fuel burn-up for example. Did no one consider what image associating highly radioactive materials with a fire might create?",
            "These word images are a field day for anti-nuclear groups, enabling deployment of their second weapon, implied discrimination. Implied discrimination, as we are increasingly aware, is pervasive and persuasive. Simply by constantly referring to leaders of organisations using the male pronoun, leaders of organisations remained male because everyone continued to assume they should be. It works because it's insidious. It isn't questioned and by repetition it becomes accepted.",
            "Clever anti-nuclear authors will insert the words 'long-lived' whenever they legitimately can. This simple phrase, differentiates nuclear materials from anything else mankind handles and makes it seem uniquely dangerous. Those same authors don’t feel obliged to use the word 'everlasting' when referring to other toxic materials.",
            "And then there is artistic licence. This licence, gifted to people so that they might entertain, is often used to mislead. Pickering's nuclear power generators were recently described as 'aging radioactive cauldrons brewing electric power'. I have a hunch that the phrase wasn’t chosen in an attempt to make them seem appealing. Artistic licence creates a tilted field as scientists and engineers and for that matter doctors and lawyers are, thankfully, not granted a similar freedom. They are required to be accurate.",
            "The nuclear industry is inclined to throw its hands in the air and say, 'It is now and has ever been thus', but today we stand on the precipice of a new era where evidence-based decision making must replace ideology and dogmatism if the problems created by a burgeoning population are to be solved. For that we need implied discrimination to be eradicated, words to be used in contexts that are both denotatively and connotatively correct and artistic licence used to convey truth and not to mislead.",
            "Can we make this happen? We can certainly try and it's important that we do. Implied discrimination, connotatively incorrect words and artistic licence are like magic tricks; they only amaze when the audience cannot see what is happening. Point out the rabbit hiding in the hat and the magician becomes a charlatan. If we point out the linguistic tricks whenever we seem them being used, they will progressively lose their power. And when the industry has the opportunity to coin new words or phrases it should think about them in the context of how they may be perceived by the public. Small Modular Reactor, for example. I know what it means to me, but I wonder what image the public forms. Did anyone check?",
            "Perhaps the industry could even start learning some tricks from the persuasion trade by adopting words with positive images. I have always wanted to adopt the automotive industry's approach to dealing with the stigma of 'used' cars, and rebrand used fuel as 'previously loved fuel'. At least this phrase is both denotatively and connotatively correct, unlike 'nuclear waste'. Am I joking? I may be, but hopefully it makes the point. At the very least we should call it used and not spent or waste.\""

            "The Climate Change Committee (CCC) described Johnson's announcement as a \"landmark moment\". In May 2019, the independent body set up to advise the government on climate change laid out a set of",
            "to enable the UK to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.",
            "John Selwyn Gummer, the CCC's chairman, said today: \"I am delighted to see the breadth of the Prime Minister’s commitment. This must now be turned into a detailed road map - so we all know what’s coming down the track in the years ahead. Our homes, the way we travel, our industries, our land, and all of us individually have a role to play as we strive to lead the world in tackling climate change. The good news is that we can also reap the rewards - improved health, a stronger economy, a boost for UK jobs and the ability to tell our children and grandchildren that the UK acted in time.\"",
            "Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC, added: \"This is our path out of the economic challenges created by the COVID crisis. And it is a set of commitments that will raise the UK’s credibility ahead of the pivotal COP26 climate summit next year.\"",
            "Tom Greatrex, CEO of the UK's Nuclear Industry Association, welcomed the scale of the ambition indicated by the plan, noting that more details will come in the Energy White Paper, which is expected later this month.",
            "\"Meeting net zero while delivering long term, skilled jobs, economic growth and export potential are the opportunities for the country. Low-carbon technology working together - not being pitted against each other - is the right approach to take,” Greatrex said.",
            "“We welcome the government setting a 2030 target for low-carbon hydrogen production. Nuclear power can produce clean, 'green' hydrogen without any carbon emissions, so it has a critical role to play in developing the hydrogen economy. We hope the government will support 'green' hydrogen, since our goal is to use hydrogen to reduce emissions. There is no use in deploying hydrogen if we have to emit large amount of carbon to create it,” he added.",
            "Ian Liddell-Grainger, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on nuclear energy, said new nuclear power will \"dramatically cut our emissions and generate thousands of good, highly skilled jobs across this country\". He added: \"I look forward to the government setting out the detail in the Energy White Paper, and getting new projects over the line.”",
            "One of those projects is Sizewell C, the proposed new nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coast. This will be a near replica of Hinkley Point C (HPC), which EDF Energy is building in Somerset and, like HPC, it will be able to supply 7% of the UK's electricity once it enters commercial operation.",
            "EDF's UK CEO Simone Rossi said the 10-point plan is \"a game changer and we are right behind it\", not only for nuclear, but also for wind, solar, storage, hydrogen, electric heating, energy saving and electric vehicles. He added that HPC is providing GBP14 billion of work to the UK supply chain.",
            "Sizewell C Managing Director, Humphrey Cadoux-Hudson, said Sizewell C is the only large-scale nuclear project ready to begin construction in the UK. \"We look forward to moving ahead quickly with the government on an innovative funding arrangement to achieve best value for money for consumers,” he said.",
            "Sizewell C Consortium - a group of more than 100 companies and organisations from the UK nuclear supply chain to encourage the government to support a state-guaranteed financing model for Sizewell C - welcomed the Prime Minister's commitment to large-scale nuclear.",
            "The group’s spokesperson, Cameron Gilmour, said the Sizewell C project will create \"tens of thousands of jobs in the UK industrial heartlands\".",
            "Separately, French nuclear engineering firm Framatome announced that it had joined the Sizewell C Consortium. Marc Duret, managing director of Framatome in the UK, said: “Framatome has called the UK home for more than 25 years and we remain committed to contributing to the country’s economic recovery and clean future with low-carbon energy.\"",
            "Framatome said it is helping the UK reach its 'net zero by 2050' target by contributing to the construction of two EPR reactors at HPC and two at the proposed Sizewell C plant. Framatome also assists maintenance and long-term operations at Sizewell B. As part of the Sizewell C project, Framatome said it expects to create 100 British jobs with engineering and construction expertise.",
            "Last week, the UK SMR consortium, led by Rolls-Royce, said it expects to create 6000 jobs within the next five years and 40,000 in 15 years \"if the government makes a clear commitment\" that enables a fleet of 16 small modular reactor power stations to be built over the next 20 years.",

            "The use of advanced nuclear technologies could help the world meet increasing electricity demand whilst reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the deployment and commercialisation of advanced reactors faces many challenges, according to a discussion on nuclear innovation at the",
            "Atlantic Council Global Energy Forum",
            "The participants in the session on Nuclear Innovation: Projections for the Next Decade on 20 January",
            "\"Just as the original prototypes do not resemble today's solar panels and wind turbines, tomorrow's nuclear looks very different from the plants of today,\" said session moderator Jackie Kempfer, senior policy advisor for Third Way's climate and energy programme and non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Center. \"The next generation of nuclear power promises to be more cost-effective and safer than ever,\" she said.",
            "\"Over the last five years, advanced reactors have progressed far more rapidly than anyone predicted and over the next 10 years we will see the construction and operation of multiple first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear technologies and the development of a global supply chain to support them,\" she said. \"But where there is progress and opportunity, there remain challenges that must be addressed in order to set the world on a path to a safe and secure advanced nuclear age.\"",
            "Chris Levesque, president and CEO of TerraPower, said the nuclear industry faces different institutional barriers that have slowed its progress. These include issues with regulation, as well as issues with public perception.",
            "\"It's really caused nuclear science to be under-leveraged to solve today's problems ... With regulatory reforms, we are really making a place not just for a resurgence of nuclear energy, but for advanced nuclear energy and nuclear innovation to be leading the way,\" Levesque said. The under-utilisation of nuclear science has not just been limited energy, but also in fields such as medicine, he added. \"We need to keep working on public support and regulatory support because nuclear does start with that disadvantage and I think people more and more are realising we need to use nuclear science.\"",
            "Oklo Inc has developed the Aurora energy plant, which is powered by a small reactor with integrated solar panels. The company's co-founder and chief operating officer, Caroline Cochran, said some issues US advanced reactors developers face stem from the US government and the regulator. The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) \"determine how nuclear power is developed, regulated and deployed\", she said.",
            "\"Nuclear in comparison with other clean energy technologies - regardless of inherent safety advances for technologies such as Oklo's, regardless of being orders of magnitude smaller than existing plants, and so forth - we are still forced to meet all the same regulations and so we're inherently at a disadvantage,\" she said.",
            "The DOE \"needs to modernise how it works with companies and, flowing out of that, how the national labs work with companies\", she said. \"I think there are still things that need to be updated and how they integrate and how they can support companies without just giving money.\"",
            "There are also challenges with the supply chain, including for fuel, for advanced reactors, Centrus Energy President and CEO Daniel Poneman said. \"High-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) is the fuel of choice for these very exciting fourth-generation designs. The bottom line is that there isn't any supply chain whatsoever for it yet.\" However, he noted that within the next year Centrus will begin enriching uranium hexafluoride gas to 19.75% under NRC licence.",
            "\"From the regulator's perspective ... our role is to protect Canadians from risk. It's not to protect them from progress and innovation\" said Rumina Velshi, president and CEO of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). \"The CNSC has made it our priority to be in a state of readiness to regulate SMRs and not to be an unnecessary impediment.\"",
            "She noted there is \"growing interest and momentum in nuclear and SMRs, and the SMR Action Plan is an indication of that.\" The action plan was published in December and responds to the recommendations identified in Canada's SMR Roadmap that was launched in November 2018. The plan lays out the next steps for the development, demonstration and deployment of SMRs for multiple applications at home and abroad. \"It's an action plan that sees the deployment of SMRs - the larger SMRs - by the late 2020s,\" Velshi said.",
            "She outlined CNSC's pre-licensing vendor design review service for small modular reactor designs. The objective of this service is \"to give proponents an opportunity to learn about the Canadian regulatory framework and the regulator's expectations. It's also an opportunity for them to hear what the regulator's concerns and issues are. From our perspective as a regulator, it's an opportunity for us to learn about these new technologies and truncate a very steep learning curve.\"",
            "The CNSC is reviewing its regulatory frameworks to make them applicable to advanced reactor designs. \"Our regulations and requirements have all been developed with our experience of Candu technology ... These are new designs - great safety systems, passive systems, a lot smaller - and some requirements simply don't make sense with these new technologies.",
            "\"One thing we have been doing is to make sure our requirements are technology-neutral. We're modifying our requirements to make it more performance-based, which allows the proponents [of advanced reactors] to come to us with a safety case. It gives them more flexibility on how they are going to meet our requirements rather than us dictating on how that should happen.\"",
            "Velshi added: \"We, as the regulator, are working on building public trust, confidence and social acceptance in these new technologies. Part of our mandate as the Canadian regulator is to disseminate objective and scientific information about nuclear matters.\"",
            "Asked what nuclear supplier countries and potential nuclear newcomer countries can do to prepare for a global advanced nuclear market, she said: \"You need standard designs that can be deployed readily and easily and safely ... We know nuclear is a very sophisticated technology and so for emerging countries, if they can benefit from the expertise, the experience, the infrastructure of mature regulators, I think that can go a long way in making these new technologies more readily available and accessible and, from my perspective, make them safer to deploy.\"",

            "Nuclear energy is the key to making climate commitments work and will play a critical role in meeting the Biden Administration's ambitious climate goals, Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) President and CEO Maria Korsnick told the organisation's annual",
            "State of the Nuclear Energy Industry",
            "Maria Korsnick addressing the NEI event yesterday (Image: NEI)",
            "\"There is no bigger opportunity in front of us than rebuilding the world's energy system around carbon-free sources,\" Korsnick said, adding that there is \"no more debate about the need for swift action\".",
            "Over the last year, utilities, state governments, and the new Administration have made \"concrete commitments\" to bring carbon emissions from electricity generation close to zero by 2035 - even sooner than the 2050 target already acknowledged to be necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change, she said.",
            "\"Fortunately, as we strive to meet those commitments, the US leads the world in producing a proven, carbon-free, scalable source of electricity, that enjoys bipartisan support,\" she said. \"That source is nuclear energy. And there's no more serious debate: It's the key to making our climate commitments work.\"",
            "\"While we need to scale up every carbon-free source available, no other source can match nuclear energy's unique combination of attributes,\" she said. The value of nuclear energy's reliability has become even more apparent over the past year, with US nuclear power plants working on through \"unprecedented\" conditions like the COVID-19 pandemic and devastating winter storms across the southern USA, she said. Nuclear has become the second-largest source of electricity in the USA overall and surpassed coal for the first time ever, she added.",
            "\"Governments, NGOs, and the private sector all agree: Ambitious climate plans only work with nuclear energy. The only question is whether we're serious about making them work,\" she said.",
            "\"To meet the challenge before us, we need to move the next generation of nuclear rapidly from design, to demonstration, to build. Across the country, talented innovators are making that happen. Spurred on by commitments from utilities, private investment, and government support, the next generation of nuclear is poised to come online.",
            "\"Technologies such as small modular reactors, micro-reactors, and other advanced designs will make nuclear even more efficient, even more affordable and even more versatile. These reactors will come in different sizes and designs. They will be able to change their output, pairing perfectly with more variable sources such as wind and solar,\" Korsnick said.",
            "These developments can also bring electricity to hard-to-reach places - communities that generally rely on expensive, carbon-emitting sources -  where traditional reactors \"just don't make sense\", she added. \"From Alaska and Puerto Rico to parts of the developing world, nuclear can be a gamechanger,\" she said. Tangible progress is being made towards the deployment of these technologies, she added.",
            "Awards made last year under the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program mean that US companies \"are able to actually build\" advanced reactors, she said. \"These are exciting steps towards getting the next generation of nuclear online before the end of the decade.",
            "\"Right now, TerraPower and X-Energy are finalising contracts with DOE for these kinds of demonstrations. Kairos Power and Southern Company Services are finalising contracts with DOE on risk-reduction projects. General Atomics, MIT, and Advanced Reactor Concepts are all delivering their own conceptual designs. Elsewhere in the federal government, the Defense Department is moving forward with its own micro-reactor demonstration programme to improve national security and address some of the largest threats to our armed forces.",
            "\"The move to demonstration is significant. These new technologies will be cost-competitive, especially with carbon-emitting sources. The next generation of nuclear can not only make a decarbonised energy system work - it can make it affordable,\" she said. To form the core of a clean energy system such technologies must be commercialised successfully, she added.",
            "\"Now we have to move beyond understanding and interest to action. Today, I'm calling on policymakers and executives to back up their pledges by making commitments to advanced reactors as part of their energy plans,\" she said.",
            "She called for continued bipartisan support from US policymakers, and highlighted the",
            ", first introduced last year. This legislation, she said, would create powerful incentives to build new nuclear plants, but such comprehensive legislation would take time to pass and to implement. In the meantime, she said, complementary policies, such as the",
            "American Nuclear Infrastructure Act",
            ", approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee last year, are needed \"to make sure the plants that we have, stay online.\"",
            "She added: \"Our climate plans can't work if we go backwards by shuttering our nuclear plants. But that is exactly the possibility we face. This year, four reactors are under threat of closure in Illinois alone. In that state, they produce twice as much clean electricity as wind and solar combined,\" she said. \"If they shut down, carbon-emitting sources will likely fill the gap. In 2020, our lost generation from coal was replaced almost entirely with natural gas.\"",
            "Korsnick urged state-level action to prevent future nuclear shut-downs and put nuclear on an \"even playing field\" with other carbon-free sources. Washington and Virginia have already passed clean energy standards, she noted, while Illinois and Minnesota, where clean energy debate, interrupted by the pandemic, have now resumed. She also highlighted state-level actions, such as tax incentives in Nebraska, a small modular reactor study in Montana and funding for SMR manufacturing in Washington.",
            "\"We're seeing movement because these states are realising an obvious truth: We can't talk about the urgency of decarbonising while sacrificing our most reliable source of carbon-free electricity. We can't celebrate bold plans while conceding defeat against the climate crisis.",
            "\"Either we're serious about building a better energy future, or we aren't. Action on nuclear energy will show our true priorities. Nuclear energy is the power source that can make it all work. It can turn some of the biggest threats we face into opportunities.\"",

            "France will construct six new nuclear power reactors, consider building a further eight and push ahead with the development of small modular reactors, President Emmanuel Macron has said.",
            "President Macron presenting details of the new energy policy",
            "Speaking at GE Steam Power's manufacturing site at Belfort in eastern France on Thursday, Macron, who faces a presidential election in April, said the main objective of the new policy was to reduce the country's energy consumption while increasing its carbon-free energy production capacity.",
            "He said in the coming decades France must produce more carbon-free electricity, because even if it reduces its energy consumption by 40%, the exit from oil and gas within 30 years implies that it will replace part of the consumption of fossil fuels with electricity. The country must therefore be able to produce up to 60% more electricity than today.",
            "\"Key to producing this electricity in the most carbon-free, safest and most sovereign way is precisely to have a plural strategy ... to develop both renewable and nuclear energies,\" Macron stated.",
            "\"We have no other choice but to bet on these two pillars at the same time. It is the most relevant choice from an ecological point of view and the most expedient from an economic point of view and finally the least costly from a financial point of view.\"",
            "The time is right for a nuclear renaissance in France, Macron said, adding he had made two important decisions regarding this.",
            "Firstly, he said the operation of all existing reactors should be extended without compromising safety.",
            "\"If it is necessary to be cautious about the ability to extend our reactors, I hope that no nuclear reactor in a state of production will be closed in the future given the very significant increase in our electrical needs; except, of course, if safety reasons were necessary.\"",
            "He added that as the operation of some reactors had already been successfully extended beyond 40 years, he was requesting EDF and the nuclear regulator to \"study the conditions for extending beyond 50 years\".",
            "Secondly, Macron announced the launch of a programme of new reactors. \"We have learned lessons from the construction of EPR in Finland, where it is now complete, and in France at Flamanville. EDF has undertaken with the nuclear sector the design of a new reactor for the French market, the EPR2, which has already mobilised more than one million hours of engineering and presents significant progress compared with the EPR of Flamanville.",
            "\"I would like six EPR2s to be built and for us to launch studies on the construction of eight additional EPR2s,\" he said. \"We will thus advance step by step.\"",
            "Preparatory projects will be started in the coming weeks, Macron said, including finalisation of the design studies, referral to the national commission for public debate, definition of the locations of the three pairs of reactors and a ramp-up of the nuclear sector. He said a broad public consultation would take place in the second half of 2022 on energy, then parliamentary discussions will be held in 2023 to revise the multi-annual energy programme.",
            "\"We are aiming for construction to begin by 2028, with the first reactor commissioned by 2035. This implementation deadline also justifies the need to extend our current reactors and develop renewable energies.\"",
            "In addition, Macron said EUR1.0 billion (USD1.1 billion) will be made available through the France 2030 re-industrialisation plan for France's Nuward small modular reactor project and \"innovative reactors to close the fuel cycle and produce less waste\". He said he had set \"an ambitious goal\" to construct a first prototype in France by 2030.",
            "\"This new programme could lead to the commissioning of 25 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity by 2050,\" Macron said.",
            "\"To implement these decisions, the regulatory, financial and organisational conditions of the sector and of the State must be met,\" he added. \"Within the State, an inter-ministerial programme department dedicated to new nuclear power will be created to oversee it, coordinate administrative procedures, and ensure compliance with construction costs and deadlines. EDF will build and operate the new EPRs.",
            "\"This national sovereignty enterprise, which is our common good, will be able to count on the support of the State for its solidity in the months, years and decades to come and to carry out this project on a scale unmatched for 40 years and to do so under the best financial and operational conditions. From a financial and regulatory perspective, massive public funding of several tens of billions of euros will be committed to finance this new programme, which will make it possible to preserve EDF's financial situation and develop the entire sector.",
            "\"This is all the more important as EDF is going through a difficult period linked in particular to the operational difficulties encountered in the nuclear fleet ... the State will assume its responsibilities to secure EDF's financial situation and its financing capacity in the short and medium-term, as well as to enable it to pursue its profitable development strategy within the framework of the energy transition.\"",
            "Macron said the government, in agreement with the European Commission, would implement a new regulation of nuclear electricity that will replace the existing ARENH mechanism. Under ARENH, set up to foster competition, rival energy suppliers can buy electricity produced by EDF's French nuclear power plants that were commissioned before 8 December 2010.",
            "The new system, he said, would enable \"French consumers, households and businesses to benefit from stable prices, close to electricity production costs in France. This is essential so that we can derive all the benefits from the nation's historic investment and from the investment that we are in the process of recording.\"",
            "Nuclear accounts for almost 75% of France's power production, but former French president Francois Hollande had aimed to limit its share of the national electricity generation mix to 50% by 2025, and to close Fessenheim - the country's oldest nuclear power plant - by the end of his five-year term, in May 2017.",
            "In June 2014, his government announced nuclear capacity would be capped at the current level of 63.2 GWe and be limited to 50% of France's total output by 2025. The",
            "French Energy Transition for Green Growth Law",
            ", adopted in August 2015, did not call for the shutdown of any currently operating power reactors, but it meant EDF would have to close older reactors in order to bring new ones online. However, under a draft energy and climate bill presented in May 2019, France will now delay its planned reduction in the share of nuclear power in its electricity mix to 50% from the current 2025 target to 2035.",

            "Innovation has been, and will continue to be, an essential driver in propelling the nuclear energy sector forward - but the industry must be prepared to embrace innovation in all areas, not just technological innovations. These were the messages from speakers in the high-level closing panel at the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA's)",
            "The panel brought to an end the 2023 Scientific Forum (Image: Dean Calma/IAEA)",
            "The world saw many changes during the 15 years it took to build and bring into operation Olkiluoto 3, including Fuukshima and regulation changes, Finland's Minister of Climate and the Environment Kai Mykkänen said, with the first EPR to come into service in Europe benefitting from \"hundreds\" of innovations. But the presence of Europe's largest nuclear reactor on the Finnish grid - it entered commercial operation earlier this year - is the key reason Finland has been able to shut down imports of electricity and gas from Russia, he said. At the same time, the country's spot and future electricity prices are lower than they have been in recent years, he added.",
            "But more innovation is needed, he said. \"I'm quite sure that within next 10 years we will see larger amount of nuclear innovation coming to the market … including of course small modular reactors but also when it comes to larger, more traditional reactor types,\" he said. Finland's investment in nuclear research and development has built on decades of experience developing and using nuclear, but now there is \"a clear, new inspiration\" for still further investment in innovation.",
            "The UK is another country where EPR units are currently under construction, with an \"ambitious\" target of 24 GWe of nuclear on the grid by 2050, UK Minister for Nuclear and Networks Andrew Bowie said. The \"absolutely clear\" message emanating from the forum - and the wider general conference - is that there can be no net-zero without nuclear power, he said. \"But it's not just about net-zero - vital as it is to decarbonise baseload,\" he said. \"It's also about affordable energy, being energy secure, and energy independent … If we can work together as like-minded nations developing the technology, supporting the innovation, supporting the research and development … then we can drive down carbon emissions and make energy cheaper and more accessible for more people across the world.\"",
            "China National Nuclear Corporation Chairman Yu Jianfeng agreed that the pace of innovation - and the pace of new technologies coming on to the market - has been an important player in the rapid growth of nuclear in China. The design of the Hualong One third-generation reactor and rapid development of small modular reactor (SMR) technology is a reflection of the many thousands of nuclear experts engaged in China's nuclear sector, as well as a large network of research institutes, that work as an integrated team. In addition, China has been continuously constructing nuclear power plants since the 1990s, standing it in good stead to meet its future ambitious construction plans.",
            "Innovating outside the box",
            "Peter Baeten, Director-General of the Belgian Nuclear Research Center SCK CEN, underlined the importance of human capital in reaching innovative solutions for challenges such as extending reactor lifetimes and also in securing societal acceptance for the growth of nuclear. While solutions, especially those at the back-end of the fuel cycle need, to be accepted by society and innovation in public interaction, as well as technological innovation, will be important for reaching such acceptance, he said.",
            "Nuclear has embraced innovation for over five decades, World Nuclear Association Director General Sama Bilbao y Léon said, so the industry already recognises that research is an absolute essential, with collaboration between research institutes and industry, and between international organisations, enabling continuous improvement and bringing developments to fruition.",
            "But while technological innovation is absolutely essential for moving the industry forward, there are other aspects of innovation that should not be overlooked, she said. \"For example, innovation in the way in which we finance new nuclear - we really need to think outside the box to attract affordable investment. We need to be innovative in the way we license and regulate these reactors,\" she said, adding that \"we need to make the most and optimise\" regulatory work to accelerate licensing at global level.",
            "\"Nuclear electricity is only one of the products that nuclear power plants can produce. We need to rethink our business model\" to factor in the many ways in which nuclear power plants can be used, she said. \"And maybe we as an industry need to innovate in the way we inspire, and attract, the next generation of nuclear talent.\"",
            "Asked by session moderator Hannah Vaughan Jones about the speed and scale of innovations, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said there will never be a \"one-size-fits-all\" solution in the energy area but said he is \"optimistic\" that the world is moving decisively. \"One very important corollary is that we can see how nuclear is firmly - very firmly - positioned in this global effort that is taking place right now,\" he said.",
            "He called for a \"larger table\" where industry, politicians, decision-makers, regulators, scientists who are advancing innovative techniques can come together to discuss \"what needs to be done\", he said. This is going to become even more important as nuclear moves into other spheres such as marine propulsion, and process heat supply, and even the integration of fusion power.\"",
            "\"My hope is that this scientific forum will have helped us in getting a clear view of where we are going, what is being done, what is needed. And the effort will continue,\" he said.",
            "The forum, which took place from 26-27 September, is the flagship side event of the IAEA",
            "Nuclear Innovations for Net Zero",
            "- focused on nuclear innovations for net-zero, and saw leading experts from around the world look at the role of new nuclear reactors for energy production; the importance of innovations such as artificial intelligence, digitalization, robotics and advanced manufacturing in supporting nuclear development; and the use of nuclear technology to avoid greenhouse gases in industrial applications and other areas.",

The country is following the IAEA's Milestones approach - a progressive, phased method to support countries which are considering or planning their first nuclear power plant in establishing the infrastructure for a nuclear power programme.",
            "Last year, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced plans for a referendum to be held on the construction of a nuclear power plant. The date for the referendum is not yet known - it will depend on a presidential decree which has not yet been issued, she said. A positive outcome from the referendum will be needed for Kazakhstan's nuclear project to proceed, but some actions already being taken include looking at technology options as well as capacity building to support nuclear projects and public outreach and information activities, Mursalova added. A site at Ulken, on the shores of Lake Balkhash, has already been identified as a suitable location for a nuclear power plant, but any nuclear power plant location will need the agreement of the local community.",
            "Kazakhstan's first nuclear power plant will be a large reactor, and coal will continue to play a major role in the country's energy mix over the next 10 years, Mursalova said. But beyond that, SMRs could be an option for replacing retiring coal plants and could provide a \"perfect\" solution for some regions, she added.",
            "Financing a nuclear programme is another consideration, and Mursalova said the Department of Atomic Energy and Industry is talking to partners about possible options including loans. But \"this is not a decision for now\" she said.",
            "Using nuclear plants for district heating and process heat needs could help reduce the commercial risk of future plants, Timur Zhantikin, director general of Samruk-Kazyna subsidiary Kazakhstan Nuclear Power Plants, told delegates. This is an area in which Kazakhstan already has experience: the former BN-350 fast reactor at Aktau operated commercially from 1973 until 1999, and provided steam for a desalination plant as well as generating electricity for the nearby town.",
            "As well as being a reliable and responsible supplier of uranium to the global community for more than 25 years Kazatomprom wants to have an active role in producing uranium fuel for Kazakhstan's nuclear plant, the company's CEO Meirzhan Yussupov said. The company is also considering potential investment in nuclear fuel cycle services to further leverage Kazakshtan's uranium resources to accelerate the nuclear programme, particularly through uranium conversion and enrichment. But such investment decisions are also a \"delicate balance\" that will take into account market dynamics, Yussupov said.",

            "A workshop hosted by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency, in partnership with World Nuclear Association and the International Atomic Energy Agency, aimed to align, where appropriate, the improvement and oversight activities of the industry, the regulators and standards development organisations. The association's Nathan Paterson provides an overview of the event.",
            "(Image: World Nuclear Association)",
            "The event, held in Paris in March, brought together some 160 participants from industry, government and regulatory bodies, as well as a mix of experienced and newcomer suppliers.",
            "The supply chain plays a crucial role within the nuclear industry; however, it is undergoing significant evolution driven by several factors. With a declining number of nuclear grade suppliers and a loss of skills in some regions, and the need to maintain existing plants and the emergence of new reactor designs, there is a renewed emphasis on innovation and diversification within the supply chain. However, supply chain oversight raises specific challenges that require regulators to adopt new practices and increase co-operation.",
            "Demands for efficiency have prompted a shift towards digitisation, automation, and advanced manufacturing techniques, all while maintaining rigorous standards. Furthermore, the global nature of the nuclear industry necessitates robust supply chain resilience to mitigate risks associated with geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, and unforeseen disruptions. Amid these dynamics, collaboration between industry stakeholders, government agencies, and research institutions becomes pivotal in shaping a sustainable and resilient supply chain that can support the present and future needs of the nuclear sector.",
            "The imperatives of climate and energy security - together with innovation in the nuclear sector - are leading an increasing number of governments and industrial end users to consider nuclear energy in their plans to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions targets. At the end of last year, we saw governments commit to triple global nuclear capacity, and indeed the nuclear industry pledge to \"at least\" triple global nuclear capacity. The aim is to accelerate the clean energy transition and realise nuclear’s role and further potential to decarbonise the entire economy.",
            "But what does a tripling actually mean? How might that add up with a variety of small, medium, and large reactors?",
            "To triple global nuclear capacity by 2050 would mean a rise from nearly 400 GWe today up to 1200 GWe in 25 years. Taking account for possible end-of-operation plant closures this translates to around 1000 GWe of new nuclear capacity by 2050. That would be equivalent to adding 40 GWe per year for 25 years. Of course that may not be linear, and we may expect a rapid expansion into the 2030s as small modular reactor (SMR) projects come to fruition. But either way, it is a lot of new nuclear power plants. 40 GWe could be anything from 40 new gigawatt scale reactors, or more than 100 SMRs, or any combination of the many different types and sizes. Increasing standardisation in the supply chain and developing means to ramp up capability and capacity to deliver on the demand for new plants will be an even greater focus for the industry for the years to comes.",

            "Deputy CEO for Shipbuilding, Floating Power Units and Marine Engineering at Rosatom’s Machine Engineering Division, Vladimir Aptekarev, on the potential for floating power units.",
            "How a 100 MW FPU might look (Image: Rosatom)",
            "There seem to be a lot of proposals for, and interest in, floating nuclear power plants around the world. To be clear, these are not the same as nuclear-powered vessels, are they?",
            "I would suggest using the term floating power unit (FPU) instead of floating nuclear power plant, to be more precise. While FPUs and nuclear-powered vessels both utilise nuclear reactors, they differ in purpose. Nuclear-powered vessels are designed for various maritime transportation tasks, whereas FPUs are non-self-propelled vessels specifically engineered to generate and supply electricity to customers. For FPU operation, coastal infrastructure is required to ensure mooring and electricity transmission onshore.",
            "Do the reactors have to be specifically designed for a floating power unit, or are they essentially slightly adapted versions of land-based SMRs?",
            "Based on the RITM-200 reactors, which are currently operational in new Project 22220 nuclear icebreakers, FPUs with power capacities of 100 MW and 106 MW have been designed. Developed by OKBM Afrikantov, the RITM series represents a unique advancement in reactor technology. The RITM-200 technology, developed by Russia, is a flagship small modular reactor (SMR) technology based on the evolution of Soviet pressurised water reactor technology initially tailored for icebreaker vessels. Through innovative technological advancements, their efficiency and reliability have been significantly improved. RITM reactors are versatile and can be utilised across three main domains: marine transportation, including nuclear icebreakers and nuclear-propelled cargo vessels; small-scale land-based nuclear power plants; and floating nuclear power units.",
            "What do you think will be the key uses for floating nuclear power units?",
            "Floating power units are specifically engineered for deployment in remote or inaccessible regions where establishing conventional power infrastructure proves impractical or costly. By supplying electricity to onshore communities or industrial facilities, FPUs offer advantages such as mobility, scalability, and reduced environmental impact compared with conventional fossil fuel-based power plants. They are increasingly recognised as a promising solution for advancing global nuclear energy. This recognition stems partly from the growing demand for sustainable power sources in remote areas and regions lacking extensive grid infrastructure. FPUs boast several advantages over alternative power generation sources. Not only are they environmentally-friendly and relatively easy to install at deployment sites, but they also address tariff concerns by ensuring stable electricity prices over extended periods. Additionally, they can facilitate heat supply to various facilities. An illustrative example of FPU deployment is the forthcoming installation of four RITM-200 floating power units at the Baimskiy Mining and Processing Plant in Chukotka. Rosatom plans to construct more than a dozen FPUs, offering ‘turnkey’ power supply solutions to coastal regions in countries across Africa, South Asia, and Latin America. These solutions, based on a build-own-operate scheme, provide stable electricity without requiring countries to invest in their own nuclear infrastructure or assume ownership of the units.",
            "What are the safety considerations and safety benefits, compared with land-based plants, and how do you think the regulatory process will work around the world?",
            "The safety concept of the RITM-200 reactor units is grounded in the principle of deep-layered protection, coupled with inherent safety features employing passive and active systems. These reactor units optimally integrate passive and active safety systems to ensure normal operation and stability, drawing from the operational experience of nuclear icebreakers equipped with RITM-200 reactor installations. In contrast to land-based nuclear power plants, the operation of FPUs adheres to the \"green field\" principle, meaning there are no activities involving nuclear fuel handling at the operational site. All fuel-related operations, including the handling of both fresh and used fuel, occur exclusively at specialised facilities within the Russian Federation. FPUs are non-self-propelled vessels housing nuclear power installations. Their design and construction comply with Russian regulations and internationally recognised maritime norms, notably the SOLAS Convention. Commissioning occurs within the territory of the Russian Federation, with licensing overseen by Rostekhnadzor and the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping, drawing from the experiences of projects like the",
            ". A specific regulatory and legal framework for FPUs exists solely within the Russian Federation. The host country’s government decides on FPU placement based on authorisation documents from its nuclear regulatory authority or another relevant body. There are no prohibitions on FPU operation, even abroad. However, effective FPU project implementation necessitates the adaptation of Russian project experience and collaboration among regulators across different countries.",
            "What about the costs - will floating nuclear power plants be cheaper than land-based ones?",
            "At the present moment, land-based nuclear power plants and floating power units represent two separate businesses. We do not sell floating power units; instead, we sell electricity generated by them. As a result of technical and economic feasibility studies, scientific research, and extensive market research in foreign countries, we have managed to adopt an extremely economically efficient and, at the same time, highly convenient principle of operation for our clients. This involves supplying electricity based on Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with highly predictable costs, extending up to 60 years, depending on the preferences and capabilities of the customer, without being tied to the cost or dependency on hydrocarbons. However, electricity supply is not interrupted for the entire duration of the contract, up to 60 years, which is the maximum projected operational lifespan of the floating power unit. This is achieved through the use of the RITM-200M, optimisation of the fuel cycle, with a refueling interval of 7-10 years, and the presence of a spare floating power unit in the operational \"energy fleet\" during the refueling and planned maintenance period when the installed power unit is sent to a specialised base in the Russian Federation. Seven power units operating worldwide, regardless of the country, can be substituted by just one floating power unit. Such a model is not only economically efficient but also eliminates the need for handling nuclear fuel in the host country of the floating power unit, following the \"green field\" principle. Additionally, it obviates the need for the foreign partner to create expensive infrastructure.",
            "What sort of global demand do you think there will be in the coming years?",
            "The demand and interest in floating power units have been increasing due to the global energy deficit. Floating power units undoubtedly possess significant commercial potential not only in Russia but also internationally, with countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America already expressing interest in them.  The potential international market for electricity abroad for the FPU project is currently estimated at more than 2.8 GW.",
            "What plans does Russia have for floating nuclear power plants – what are your designs and what is the state of current projects?",
            "The floating nuclear power plant",
            "has been commissioned marking a significant milestone. A project for supplying power to the Baimskiy Mining and Processing Plant is being implemented. Under a contract signed in 2021, the Machine Engineering Division of the State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom will supply four FPUs, each with a capacity of up to 106 MW of electric power, for the project. Of these, three FPUs will be primary units, while the fourth will serve as a backup. The project for supplying power to the Baimskiy Mining and Processing Plant will be the first \"serial\" reference for floating power units and the world’s first experience in electrification using a floating power unit for mineral extraction projects. In 2023, technical design work commenced for 100 MW FPUs based on the RITM-200M reactor units, developed for export with enhanced technical and economic performance suited for relatively warm climates. Currently, negotiations are in progress with several countries across different regions of the world, with some negotiations already resulting in signed agreements.",

            "Three companies developing small nuclear power reactor technology have debated whether US and UK regulators – the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) – ought to work together to smooth their path through the licensing process.",
            "Bill Fox, chief executive of Generation mPower LLC, Thomas Mundy, vice president of the Program Office at NuScale Power LLC and Eric Loewen, chief consulting engineer at GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) spoke at an evidence session on small nuclear power held by the UK parliamentary Energy and Climate Change Committee on 8 July. The committee published a transcript of the session on 14 July.",
            "Asked by committee chairman Tim Yeo how the two countries might collaborate, Mundy said: \"NuScale Power are receiving considerable support from the US Department of Energy (DoE). There are opportunities where the two governments could collaborate on that kind of support and also in the licensing and export areas for the technology itself, particularly between the NRC and the ONR and the licensing of this technology and also on the development side.\"",
            "But the two regulators differ in their approach, he said. The NRC approach is \"very prescriptive\", while the ONR is \"more performance based\", he said. \"Ultimately, their goals are the same - to approve designs to the utmost safety in the course of that review,\" he said.",
            "Fox said his company had already spent nearly $500 million on work toward licensing and detailed design and testing of the mPower reactor though it has yet to make its submission of a design certification application to the NRC. There should be collaboration between not only regulatory bodies, but also governmental bodies to help fund the detailed design engineering \"that is absolutely required to provide cost certainty and schedule predictability in any deployment model or any deployment type of program,\" Fox said.",
            "NuScale's owner, Babcock & Wilcox Company, said in April it expects to invest up to $15 million annually, beginning the third quarter of 2014, in its small modular reactor program. The B&W mPower reactor design is a scalable, modular, advanced light water reactor system in which the nuclear core and steam generators are contained within a single vessel.",
            "Loewen said he did not see any challenges with licensing small modular reactors compared to large nuclear reactors in the UK. The ONR has about 350 safety analysis principles, he said, and his company's PRISM reactor design are \"very much in concert\" with those.",
            "In October 2010, Savannah River Nuclear Solutions signed a memorandum of understanding with GEH to jointly explore the development of a PRISM reactor at the DoE's Savannah River Site in South Carolina. In November 2011, GEH proposed to build its PRISM at Britain’s Sellafield nuclear site and the UK's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority said in January that GEH’s sodium-cooled reactor technology is a \"credible option\" for managing the UK's plutonium stockpile.",
            "Mundy said the NRC has not licensed an SMR but the design NuScale Power is developing is based on \"tried and true\" 50-year-old technology, but \"whatever regulator you are dealing with, you need to make sure that you give them a full and complete application so they can do a thorough and timely review of it.\"",
            "Fox added that \"there are quite a few safety case analyses\"” that are not required in an SMR that may be required in a large reactor. There are obvious differences in scale with, for example, control room staffing, emergency planning zones, and loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), he said.",
            "It would be an advantage if the ONR modified its Generic Design Assessment (GDA) to suit SMRs. In the USA, mPower has its \"design specific review standard\", a deviation from the standard review plan on which the NRC licensed all prior large reactors.  \"I think it would be advantageous for the UK to adopt a similar type of approach,\" he said.",
            "Licensing experts at NuScale Power \"“are advising that because the UK process is very performance-based that it should be processed similar to what we will experience ultimately to get through the NRC's review of the application,\" Mundy said. There would be \"greater efficiency and benefit\"” if the two organisations could collaborate on their examination of the same technology.",

            "Chair, Nuclear Innovation and Advisory Board",
            "Loewen does not see the need to change the GDA process \"per se\". \"The ONR has a great history of licensing a wide variety of technologies. They also work on the military technology, so I think they have that skillset to be able to enter in with the current process that they have,\" he said.",
            "Representatives of the ONR visited mPower’s design centre and testing facilities in Lynchburg last November, Fox said.  \"I think they are getting an appreciation for the challenge as far as what the resources they may need. I cannot address their capacity to address those needs,\" he said.",
            "Asked why it takes about five years to license a new reactor design, Fox said, there is certain timescale before a company submits a licence application and then regulators \"will want two, three or four years to do the review.\"",
            "The NRC is committed to trying to review and approve design certification applications within 39 months \"on the premise\", Mundy said, that it receives a full and complete application. \"What that means is debateable but they have established a very extensive process that takes a lot of time, not only for them to review it, but to prepare the application to make it full and complete takes several years before you are in a position to submit it,\" he said. One of the things that \"“drives the process\" in the USA is the activities associated with public comment and intervention, Mundy said.",
            "Loewen said that \"it is best in the nuclear industry to be second\" in terms of licensing. \"It is like the Tour de France, you do not want to lead the whole way. So what we need to do, when we look at the licence or the big reactors in the United States and the GDA process in the UK, find out what the regulatory agencies did not like so that when we submit our application it is a quality submittal that addresses those sorts of thing,\" he said.",
            "UK is starting from behind",
            "Dame Sue Ion, chair of the UK’s Nuclear Innovation and Research Advisory Board, agreed there is scope for greater collaboration between the UK and other countries.",
            "\"It is difficult to see how we could do an SMR from scratch ourselves. Clearly it is possible but, in terms of the cost and the time that it would take to do that, we are starting from behind. The Americans have already pumped hundreds of millions of dollars, both corporate investment and state investment, into moving the SMR projects along. Other nation states are also with their governments financing small modular reactors design, with the intention to deploy,\" Ion said.",
            "Fiona Rayment, director of Fuel Cycle Solutions at the National Nuclear Laboratory, said there is a real opportunity to \"bring best practice together\" to streamline processes, both through key vendors working with various manufacturing organisations and by looking at the whole regulatory regime. A number of SMR units \"that are being offered up at the moment\" are still going through the design phase, she said. Any new technology \"needs to get beyond first of a kind before you can start to determine how economic it is,\" she said.",
            "SMRs still have some way to go before completion of detailed design work, Ion said, \"which is why there is always a trade‐off between when do you submit for a licence assessment or not because the more design that you have done the easier it is from the point of view of the questions back and the adjustments that you might have to make.\"",
            "The \"alternative\", Rayment said, is \"to do the full design upfront and then push that through,\" but then there is a \"risk associated with the vendor in terms of how much time and effort they would need to put in before engaging the regulator in terms of how that design could be applied within a particular country.\"",
            "The UK regulatory system is flexible and goal oriented, and not \"tick-in-the-box based,\" Ion said.",
            "\"One of the real benefits of the opportunity that SMR gives us now is that they are going through licensing in the United States to design and, therefore, there is an incredible opportunity for the two regulators to work together with respect to global regulation of this particular type of technology. It is the first time in a generation where the UK has got an opportunity to be there and on the front foot, especially if a first deployment were to occur here in the United Kingdom. It would give us an enormous competitive advantage as a nation on the global stage,\" she said.",
            "Ion is working on an SMR feasibility study for government. She told the committee an interim report on that study will be completed next month. The study is a project set up by the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills. Companies involved in the report to date include, she said, Atkins, Rolls-Royce and Amec, together with the National Nuclear Laboratory, which is leading on the project. The project has no international partners so far, she said, \"because the purpose of the study is to examine the potential of SMRs for the UK by looking at whether there is genuinely a global market for SMRs, what the route to market in the UK might well be, what the options are in terms of technology, realistically, and where the opportunities are for capture of UK manufacturing capacity and intellectual property.\""

            "Three companies developing small nuclear power reactor technology have debated whether US and UK regulators – the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) – ought to work together to smooth their path through the licensing process.",
            "Bill Fox, chief executive of Generation mPower LLC, Thomas Mundy, vice president of the Program Office at NuScale Power LLC and Eric Loewen, chief consulting engineer at GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) spoke at an evidence session on small nuclear power held by the UK parliamentary Energy and Climate Change Committee on 8 July. The committee published a transcript of the session on 14 July.",
            "Asked by committee chairman Tim Yeo how the two countries might collaborate, Mundy said: \"NuScale Power are receiving considerable support from the US Department of Energy (DoE). There are opportunities where the two governments could collaborate on that kind of support and also in the licensing and export areas for the technology itself, particularly between the NRC and the ONR and the licensing of this technology and also on the development side.\"",
            "But the two regulators differ in their approach, he said. The NRC approach is \"very prescriptive\", while the ONR is \"more performance based\", he said. \"Ultimately, their goals are the same - to approve designs to the utmost safety in the course of that review,\" he said.",
            "Fox said his company had already spent nearly $500 million on work toward licensing and detailed design and testing of the mPower reactor though it has yet to make its submission of a design certification application to the NRC. There should be collaboration between not only regulatory bodies, but also governmental bodies to help fund the detailed design engineering \"that is absolutely required to provide cost certainty and schedule predictability in any deployment model or any deployment type of program,\" Fox said.",
            "mPower's owner, Babcock & Wilcox Company, said in April it expects to invest up to $15 million annually, beginning the third quarter of 2014, in its small modular reactor program. The B&W mPower reactor design is a scalable, modular, advanced light water reactor system in which the nuclear core and steam generators are contained within a single vessel.",
            "Loewen said he did not see any challenges with licensing small modular reactors compared to large nuclear reactors in the UK. The ONR has about 350 safety analysis principles, he said, and his company's PRISM reactor design are \"very much in concert\" with those.",
            "In October 2010, Savannah River Nuclear Solutions signed a memorandum of understanding with GEH to jointly explore the development of a PRISM reactor at the DoE's Savannah River Site in South Carolina. In November 2011, GEH proposed to build its PRISM at Britain’s Sellafield nuclear site and the UK's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority said in January that GEH’s sodium-cooled reactor technology is a \"credible option\" for managing the UK's plutonium stockpile.",
            "Mundy said the NRC has not licensed an SMR but the design NuScale Power is developing is based on \"tried and true\" 50-year-old technology, but \"whatever regulator you are dealing with, you need to make sure that you give them a full and complete application so they can do a thorough and timely review of it.\"",
            "Fox added that \"there are quite a few safety case analyses\"” that are not required in an SMR that may be required in a large reactor. There are obvious differences in scale with, for example, control room staffing, emergency planning zones, and loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), he said.",
            "It would be an advantage if the ONR modified its Generic Design Assessment (GDA) to suit SMRs. In the USA, mPower has its \"design specific review standard\", a deviation from the standard review plan on which the NRC licensed all prior large reactors.  \"I think it would be advantageous for the UK to adopt a similar type of approach,\" he said.",
            "Licensing experts at NuScale Power \"“are advising that because the UK process is very performance-based that it should be processed similar to what we will experience ultimately to get through the NRC's review of the application,\" Mundy said. There would be \"greater efficiency and benefit\"” if the two organisations could collaborate on their examination of the same technology.",
            "\"It is the first time in a generation where the UK can be on the front foot\"",
            "Chair, Nuclear Innovation and Advisory Board",
            "Loewen does not see the need to change the GDA process \"per se\". \"The ONR has a great history of licensing a wide variety of technologies. They also work on the military technology, so I think they have that skillset to be able to enter in with the current process that they have,\" he said.",
            "Representatives of the ONR visited mPower’s design centre and testing facilities in Lynchburg last November, Fox said.  \"I think they are getting an appreciation for the challenge as far as what the resources they may need. I cannot address their capacity to address those needs,\" he said.",
            "Asked why it takes about five years to license a new reactor design, Fox said, there is certain timescale before a company submits a licence application and then regulators \"will want two, three or four years to do the review.\"",

            "Ernest Moniz, US energy secretary, summarized the five key areas he had already discussed during the first day of the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA's) General Conference - peaceful cooperation, safety, security, non-proliferation and disarmament.",
            "Moniz spoke to reporters during the IAEA General Conference (Image: US-UN Mission Vienna)",
            "The USA \"strongly supports\" the IAEA's Peaceful Uses Initiative (PUI) and is \"actively considering the issues of the next steps and the potential for expanding it beyond the five-year period,\" he said.",
            "Moniz was referring to the $50 million, five-year pledge the USA announced when the IAEA established the PUI in 2010 to raise extra-budgetary funds for its activities that promote the peaceful uses of nuclear technology. The PUI supports implementation of Article IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).",
            "On safety, the USA has emphasized at the General Conference \"its continuing commitment to developing the small modular reactor option as one that could be very attractive, starting in the next decade, and which certainly has very good safety and security features,\" Moniz said.",
            "A \"new development\" regarding security, he said, is that \"more than 50 kg of HEU [high-enriched uranium] has just been moved from Poland,\" Moniz said. \"The USA worked with Russia cooperatively to accomplish that – taking one more step in our long-term process of removing and in many cases eliminating HEU and plutonium from various countries.\"",
            "Concerning non-proliferation, Moniz underlined the \"critical importance\" of collaboration with the IAEA. \"Whether it's Iran, Syria or North Korea, the IAEA is central to what we are trying to accomplish in our non-proliferation programs.\"",
            "On disarmament, Moniz noted that the USA is \"working hard\" at its Article VI obligations. \"We have eliminated 26,000 strategic warheads, 85% of the Cold War maximum. As the president [Barack Obama] re-emphasized in his Berlin Speech last year, this will all come together in the Nuclear Security Summit that the president will host in 2016.\"",
            "Article VI of the NPT represents the only binding commitment in a multilateral treaty to the goal of disarmament by the nuclear-weapon states.",
            "The first Nuclear Security Summit was held in Washington DC in 2010. In June 2013, Obama announced that the USA would host what is presumed will be the final such summit in 2016. \"We haven't set a date yet but that will be pretty early in 2016. We hope that our summit will provide a lot of momentum for the IAEA in its second security conference, which it will hold at the end of that year,\" Moniz said.",
            "Asked about the USA's current plans for development of the American Centrifuge Plant - an advanced uranium enrichment facility in Piketon - Moniz said: \"We are maintaining the current centrifuges that have been put into operation at Portsmouth [Ohio].\"",
            "The US Department of Energy (DoE) is taking over the American Centrifuge Plant project from bankrupt United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC).",
            "\"We are evaluating the path forward, with first an inter-agency re-evaluation of what are our needs in terms of amounts and schedule both for tritium and eventually for any potential need, which we don't anticipate, of enriched uranium for our defence purposes. Clearly, the issue here is that for defence purposes we need American-origin technology, American-origin uranium, American-origin reactors, etc. So we are evaluating again whether or not we move to a full nuclear defence train of centrifuges. And that's a decision we hope to come to over the next several months,\" he said.",
            "Moniz could not respond to questions about Global Laser Enrichment – General Electric's development of an uranium enrichment services capability – or about ITER - the international project to design and build an experimental fusion reactor – \"because I am for two years recused from discussing those issues.\"",
            "Asked about the DoE's Savannah River Site (SRS) and the potential market price for separated plutonium used from mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, Moniz said: \"Our MOX project has got nothing to do with our reprocessing at this stage; this is about disposal of the 34 tonnes and on that we remain in a dialogue within the Administration and with Congress in terms of whether that is in fact going to be the path forward.\"",
            "In 2000, the United States and Russia signed a bilateral agreement stipulating that each country would commit to eliminating 34 tonnes of surplus military plutonium produced during the Cold War by recycling it as fuel for civil nuclear applications. In 2008, the DoE made an agreement with a joint venture created by the Areva and Shaw groups for the construction of a MOX fuel production plant. The decision was made to build one plant on the Savannah River site, in Aiken, South Carolina, as part of the American plutonium recycling program.",
            "SRS is also home to the Savannah River National Laboratory and the USA's only operating radiochemical separations facility. Its tritium facilities are also the USA's only source of tritium, an essential component in nuclear weapons. The USA's only MOX manufacturing plant is being constructed at SRS overseen by the National Nuclear Security Administration. When operational, the MOX facility will convert legacy weapons-grade plutonium into fuel suitable for commercial power reactors.",
            "\"The only issue is can we afford it, given the substantial escalation in cost since this was put forward,\" Moniz said. \"We have argued that this would be a good time to evaluate all the pathways in terms of what we can do. That in turn would involve discussions with Russia as well but that’s all in play and when the fiscal year 2015 budget is hopefully, eventually passed by the Congress that will do a lot in terms of congressional intent with regard to that path forward.\"",
            "In the global arena, commercial reprocessing of MOX is being done in France and potentially in Japan, for example. \"Our issue is that first of all, and we've it made pretty clear, we are not interested, or supportive frankly, certainly in the United States, of moving forward with a MOX fuel cycle, quite distinct from disposing of the military sources. On the other hand, we certainly understand Japan's desire to move forward,\" he said. \"A major concern that we have, and the Japanese have this as a policy, is we do not have accumulation of separated plutonium beyond what is in some sense the working amount for MOX. Clearly in Japan, if and when a significant number of nuclear reactors are restarted, well, by definition, there will not be an end use for the MOX until that happens.\"",
            "Asked for his comment on China, which this year marks its 30th anniversary of membership of the IAEA, Moniz said he had been involved in a number of the nuclear discussions with the Chinese government in the last year and a half as energy secretary. \"As far as I can tell, we certainly share the same commitments to seeing nuclear power as an important option going forward, 'emissions-free', both of conventional pollutants and CO2. We both understand completely the issue of needing strong regulation for safety purposes.\"",
            "\"We have cooperated with China in establishing a security centre which is under construction and has regard to work with third countries.\" Moniz was referring to the Centre of Excellence on Nuclear Safety in the Chanyang science and technology park in Beijing that is expected to be up and running next year. The centre will have laboratories, exhibition areas, classrooms, test sites and response force exercise facilities.",
            "\"China is obviously part of the P5+1, and it is very important that all of us keep working together to have these countries comply with international norms - UN security council norms, IAEA norms. I think right now we are short of that standard in terms of compliance by those countries. We look forward to working with all of the P5 and P5+1 in terms of advancing that.\"",
            "P5 refers to the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the USA; +1 is Germany.",
            "Moniz refused \"to get into the specifics of ongoing negotiations\" between the USA and China, but said that \"no agreement has yet been reached with Iran - though there are negotiations going on there this week – and this needs all of the P5+1 to be on the same page.\"",
            "Asked about the agreement Pakistan and China signed in March 2013 for Chinese National Nuclear Corp to supply two ACP-1000 units on a turnkey basis at the Chashma Nuclear Power Complex in the Punjab region of Pakistan, Moniz said, \"Anything done, frankly anywhere, has to be done under the highest standards of safeguards and the appropriateness of technology utilization. There will be some very detailed issues to be explored in terms of the technologies incorporated in any such project. Otherwise that's probably a question for the Department of State.\"",
            "There is a \"substantial strain\" in the relationship between the USA and Russia at the moment \"for obvious reasons\", Moniz said, referring to the unrest in Ukraine. \"Nevertheless, on a case-by-case basis, we continue to cooperate with Russia on those areas of mutual nuclear security concern … With regard to science and energy projects that are not in that category … there is not a lot of activity at the moment and we are going to have to see how issues in Ukraine are resolved.\""

We are also one of the first nations to enter into the decommissioning process and because we had such a large reactor build early on, we are perhaps a little further along in that process. So we're useful people to talk to. We are also very clear in our commitments to safety security and safeguards and that is helpful for sharing best practice.\"",

            ": \"Government support, whether through policy, regulation, law or financial support mechanisms, is key to any new build project moving ahead. The UK government's recognition of nuclear as a low-carbon technology is leading the global market in this area.",
            "\"British government policy to support new build nuclear projects is seen as ground-breaking and a number of countries are looking to the UK to learn and to follow its lead. The system of Contracts-for-Difference, together with a government guarantee to protect the debt financiers, is seen as key to developing nuclear and other low-carbon projects.",
            "\"In addition, the professional service providers in the UK have been leading the way in supporting new build projects. Legal, financial and advisory professionals have long been seen as world leaders in the project financing of energy and infrastructure projects around the globe. Nuclear is no different with many new build projects looking to the UK for advice.\"",
            "Mike Waite, director of new plant market development at Westinghouse Electric Company, told",
            "he is often asked about the UK's nuclear program.",
            "\"I get to visit with a lot of NEPIOs (Nuclear Energy Program Implementing Organizations), and energy ministries in Europe and further afield in the Middle East, Africa and the Far East. In addition to asking about our AP1000 plant construction projects - with the first two reactors currently in the hot functional test phase - they always want to know about the progress of the three nuclear new build projects in the UK,\" he said.",
            "Those projects involve EDF Energy/Areva's European Pressurized Reactor, Hitachi's Advanced Boiling Water Reactor and Westinghouse's AP1000 designs.",
            "\"The UK provides a tremendous reference market for countries considering nuclear new build and benchmarks can be taken from an efficient operating fleet, independent licensing of new nuclear technologies, electricity market reform to support clean energy projects, development of the supply chain for future construction projects, financing and many more. British companies working on nuclear new build will be well placed to take the experience gained on all phases of the UK projects, from planning to commissioning, and use this to help other nations develop their programs.\"",
            "Claire Harvey, senior commercial and nuclear lawyer at Prospect Law, noted that the UK's energy policy is to expand its \"low-carbon contribution\".",
            ": \"Nuclear will play a key role in this and there are plans to build up to 16GWe of nuclear capacity over the coming years. Plans to develop the Hinkley Point reactor are well-advanced, and others are in development and going through the regulatory process. The UK recognises that such nuclear expansion can't take place without the issue of the long-term management of its radioactive waste being adequately addressed, and it is actively seeking a solution to this. In addition, it is also looking at the future use of small modular reactor technology through a £250 million ($325 million) research program sponsored by government.\"",
            "She added: \"The UK has a breadth of experience covering nuclear new build, and waste management and decommissioning of its older facilities. Underpinning this is a robust nuclear regulatory system based on sound laws and regulation derived from the IAEA's Safety Fundamentals and Safety Requirements.",
            "\"Specialist legal support is available to newcomer countries from experienced nuclear law firms such as Prospect Law, who can work with local law firms to develop nuclear laws and regulations specific for a particular country. And because the UK does not manufacture reactors we are more independent than most when it comes to providing regulatory and legal advice to newcomer countries.\"",

            "The UK's Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has presented four key targets in its corporate plan for 2017/2018 published yesterday. It has also published its annual report and accounts for 2016/2017, in which its chairman describes the \"significant change\" the organisation has been through, both at board and management level, \"to ensure we remain fit for the future\".",
            "ONR, which became a Public Corporation three years ago, is an independent body, accountable to Parliament through the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. It is sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in relation to governance, finance and conventional health and safety issues. It is governed by a ten-strong independent board, which supports the work of 564 staff based in Liverpool, Cheltenham and London.",
            "The four targets it has outlined are: support the UK government in managing a smooth exit from Euratom, particularly in relation to nuclear safeguards arrangements, and regarding potential small modular reactor deployment in the UK; address long-standing issues across the defence portfolio, with three sites under enhanced regulatory attention and preparation for the successor",
            "submarine program; assist the Health and Safety Executive and Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in the implementation of European Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom, laying down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation, through the introduction of revised Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 and Emergency Planning regulations; manage appropriate changes to its safeguarding scope, due to the UK's decision to leave Euratom.",
            "\"ONR is the custodian of a substantial regulatory program that stretches decades into the future,\" it says in the report. \"To support delivery of this, we will develop our organisation for the long term in a way that is mindful of our cost impact and optimises our effectiveness.\"",
            "It adds: \"With collective passion for our mission, determination to develop ONR capability for the long term and a staff team that is the envy of the world, we are confident that ONR will remain a positive influence on nuclear safety and security at home and abroad.\"",
            "As well as delivering its \"demanding regulatory program\", it will focus on its performance and sustainability, through a two- to three-year program, it said. This year, it will focus on modernising its approach \"to get the best out of our staff\", and it intends to improve its approach to \"knowledge management\". This means taking the opportunity to review its operational business processes, seeking to become \"more joined up and efficient\", it says. Over the next two years, it intends to become more efficient through enhanced IT and estates management. This will need strong corporate leadership by the executive management team to modernise ONR, and by the regulatory management team, which has a \"particular role in connecting regulatory operations with strategic direction and demands, and optimising the key elements of technical expertise and management capability\", it says.",
            "For this year, ONR listed five goals. Two of these are to address \"some of the world's most challenging nuclear scenarios\", such as Sellafield, and an ageing operating fleet that supplied about 18% of the UK's energy in 2016. Thirdly, to assess three new reactor designs, the AP1000, UK ABWR and UK HPR1000, which are due for deployment at four sites. The EPR reactor which has already been design assessed is due to be deployed at Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C. In total, these are anticipated to provide over 16 GWe of electricity through the construction of 13 reactors on six sites. Fourthly, to regulate one new reactor licensee and organisations that have different governance, different experience of nuclear regulation and different reactor designs. Finally, to implement outcome-based security regulation.",
            "In the annual report, ONR Chairman Nick Baldwin said the past year had been \"yet another challenging one for ONR on many fronts\".",
            "The board has overseen ONR's response to recent government decisions giving the go-ahead for the design and construction of a new nuclear reactor at Hinkley Point C and to a successor class of submarine, Baldwin said. Alongside this, ONR has been making provision for the impact on nuclear regulation arising from the Referendum decision last June to withdraw from the European Union and, as a result, from the Euratom Treaty, \"whilst continuing to regulate nuclear safety, security and conventional health and safety at licensed nuclear sites across Great Britain to ensure the industry operates safely and securely\", he added.",
            "Other achievements of note include, he said: continuing significant improvements, for example at Sellafield, reducing public hazard; recent publication of new Security Assessment Principles (SyAPs) now aligned with ONR's approach to safety regulation by placing the onus on dutyholders to deliver defined security outcomes whilst allowing greater flexibility of approach and encouraging innovation in security solutions; its contribution to meeting the UK's international obligations, for example, reporting on behalf of the UK Government to the International Atomic Energy Agency's 7th Convention on Nuclear Safety; productive support to stakeholders across Great Britain through local forums and a successful Non-Government Organisations meeting and furthering strong relationships with government departments, agencies and the Devolved Administrations (of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales).",
            "\"ONR underwent significant change over the period of this report both at Board and management level to ensure we remain fit for the future,\" Baldwin said in the forward to the report. At board level, ministers re-appointed Oona Muirhead as security non-executive director and chair of the Security Committee. Baldwin said this brings \"continuity and stability to the Committee in the face of an evolving and changing global and national threat environment\".",
            "Adriènne Kelbie, ONR chief executive, said the regulator had \"embarked on a journey of significant operational change\". She said: \"We began to work as a more holistic organisation that wants to reflect the very best practice in governance, management, systems and processes and whose leaders demonstrate the importance of behaviours, alongside technical prowess. We set up new cross-directorate governance groups, to better engage our staff in helping ONR respond to strategic risk and to better reflect the diversity of our organisation. We revised our functions to better align authority and accountability across HR, Finance, Policy and Communications, and Regulatory operations, and established a new Information and Technology Directorate. Our Regulatory functions were also re-structured to address the nuclear lifecycle: New Nuclear Build, Operating Facilities, Sellafield, Decommissioning, Fuel & Waste and Civil Nuclear Security and introduced a new Technical Division to provide deep technical support to the chief nuclear inspector.\"",
            "Richard Savage, chief nuclear inspector, said ONR had continued its \"robust assessment\" of new reactor designs, with the AP1000 Design Acceptance Confirmation issued in March.",
            "ONR has continued to apply its \"proportionate approach to regulatory attention\", he said, noting that the Heysham 1 and Hartlepool nuclear units had returned to routine operations following \"effective remedial action\" to address a boiler defect.",
            "Its transport inspections and package assessments have provided \"continued confidence\" in the safe transport of nuclear and radiological materials, he said. It has also continued to enhance its regulation of the supply chain on achieving high standards.",
            "ONR this year took a significant step to \"outcome-focused\" security regulation, he said, with publication in March of its first Security Assessment Principles. \"This pivotal shift in our regulatory framework is aligned with the goal-setting approach that has been applied so successfully in the nuclear and conventional safety arenas for many years. Our Security Assessment Principles provide an essential foundation as the UK moves towards a non-prescriptive nuclear security regime that strengthens the accountability of the dutyholder,\" he added.",
            "ONR has \"sought to appropriately enhance\" its international engagement and notably, led a UK delegation at the 7th Convention on Nuclear Safety, on behalf of the government, he said.",
            "On 2017/18, Savage said that, \"as our operational developments bed in\", he remains confident in ONR's capabilities to meet the near-term challenges, but also to shape itself well for the long term.",
            "In the 2016/2017 financial year, ONR was funded by cost recovery from dutyholders (96%) and a grant from DWP (4%). Its total income for the 2016-2017 was GBP70.7 million ($91.2 million), which it forecasts to rise to GBP80.4 million in 2017/2018. The forecast only includes resource expenditure and excludes capital expenditure of GBP0.7 million."

            "Nuclear power plays a key role in the UK government's Clean Growth Strategy, published yesterday, which defines how it aims to reduce carbon emissions across the whole economy. As part of the Climate Change Act, the government needs to cut CO2 emissions by 57% from 1990 levels by 2050.",
            "Issued by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), the strategy states the UK played a central role in securing the 2015 Paris Agreement in which, for the first time, 195 countries (representing over 90% of global economic activity) agreed stretching national targets to keep the global temperature rise below two degrees.",
            "\"The actions and investments that will be needed to meet the Paris commitments will ensure the shift to clean growth will be at the forefront of policy and economic decisions made by governments and businesses in the coming decades. This creates enormous potential economic opportunity - an estimated $13.5 trillion of public and private investment in the global energy sector alone will be required between 2015 and 2030 if the signatories to the Paris Agreement are to meet their national target,\" the document says.",
            "\"The UK is well placed to take advantage of this economic opportunity. Our early action on clean growth means that we have nurtured a broad range of low-carbon industries, including some sectors in which we have world leading positions,\" it adds.",
            "The government aims to invest GBP900 million ($1.2 billion) of public funds in innovation for the strategy. In partnership with the Research Councils and Innovate UK, this includes GBP460 million in nuclear to support work in areas including future nuclear fuels, new nuclear manufacturing techniques, recycling and reprocessing, and advanced reactor design. It also includes GBP265 million for smart systems to reduce the cost of electricity storage, advance innovative demand response technologies and develop new ways of balancing the grid.",
            "For its clean growth and industrial strategy, BEIS said it has welcomed early work on sector deals in nuclear, auto manufacturing and industrial digitalisation, all of which are \"central to productivity in the low-carbon economy\". The government will \"challenge businesses in all sectors to increase their competitiveness in relation to the shift to clean energy,\" it added.",
            "On policies and proposals for growing low-carbon sources of electricity, the strategy highlights the delivery of new nuclear capacity through the final investment decision last year on Hinkley Point C - under construction in Somerset, England - and the government's intention to \"progress discussions with developers to secure a competitive price for future projects in the pipeline\".",
            "Regarding government innovation investment, the strategy states the need to bring down the costs of nuclear power while maintaining safety by investing in innovation that will help plants to be built to time and budget.",
            "The government has asked the Nuclear Innovation and Research Office to convene a new advisory board, building on the success of the Nuclear Innovation and Research Advisory Board. The board will provide independent expertise and advice to support and inform the government's Nuclear Innovation Programme.",
            "The government is also announcing that it will invest GBP7 million to further develop the capability and capacity of the nuclear regulators to support the development of advanced technologies, the strategy says.",
            "Industry is developing a potential nuclear sector deal as part of the government's Industrial Strategy, co-ordinated around the objective of achieving cost reductions, it adds.",
            "Referring to the period beyond the Fifth Carbon Budget (which covers UK emissions reductions in the period 2028 to 2032), BEIS said there is \"even greater uncertainty\" about which technologies will help the country reduce emissions by at least 80% by 2050.",
            "\"It is even more challenging to predict what the UK economy will look like in 2050 than in 2032. However, exploring the plausible potential pathways to 2050 helps us to identify low-regrets steps we can take in the next few years common to many versions of the future, as well as key technologies and uncertainties,\" it said.",
            "To demonstrate this, it has presented three illustrative long-term pathways in the strategy.",
            "The electricity pathway sees electricity is the main source of energy in 2050. \"There are many more electric vehicles, we replace our gas boilers with electric heating and industry moves to cleaner fuels. Altogether this means we use around 80% more electricity than today, and virtually all of it comes from clean sources (renewables and nuclear),\" it said. In this pathway, carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) is not used in the UK by 2050.",
            "Under the hydrogen pathway, hydrogen is used to heat homes and buildings, as well as to fuel many of the vehicles used in 2050 and power the UK's industry. The emissions removal pathway sees sustainable biomass power stations used in tandem with CCUS technology.",
            "Concerning actual and projected power sector emissions that takes into account the government's clean growth pathway, the strategy anticipates that emissions from the power sector could need to be close to, or even lower than, zero in 2050.",
            "By 2032, power emissions could fall by 80% compared with today, to around 16 Mt, according to the strategy. This could be achieved in three ways, it says. Firstly, by growing low-carbon sources, such as renewables and nuclear, to over 80% of electricity generation, and phasing out unabated coal power. Secondly, by enabling a smarter, more flexible system, unlocking significant expansion of interconnection, electricity storage, and demand side response, the first steps of which are set out in the Smart Systems and Flexibility Plan. For consumers, this could mean smart appliances and smart tariffs which help balance the grid in return for lower bills, it says. Thirdly, keeping costs down for consumers by reducing any wasted energy, including more efficient electrical products.",
            "\"To achieve this, we need to continue bringing down the costs of low-carbon generation from renewables and nuclear power, and ensure that the UK can deploy CCUS at scale during the 2030s, subject to costs coming down sufficiently. We also need to remove barriers and improve price signals for smart energy innovations which improve the efficiency and flexibility of the system,\" it says.",
            "The UK's Nuclear Industry Association (NIA) has welcomed government's Clean Growth Strategy.",
            "Tom Greatrex, NIA chief executive, said: \"This report shows a clear low-carbon growth strategy which, underpinned by the industrial strategy, will benefit both the UK's low-carbon economy and our ambitious decarbonisation targets. As we move to reducing UK emissions further through the phase out of fossil fuels, decarbonisation of heat and power and increasing the take up of electric vehicles, new nuclear, combined with renewables as part of a lower carbon mix, will be a vital component of the UK's reliable and secure electricity generation future.\"",
            "The association - which represents more than 250 companies, including nuclear power station operators, new build developers and vendors, those engaged in decommissioning, waste management, all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle, supply chain and consultancy companies - welcomed the government's recognition that to deliver its strategy, a mix of low-carbon electricity sources will be needed, and that one technology alone cannot deliver the ambitions set.",
            "The Levy Control Framework - designed to control the costs of supporting low carbon electricity, paid for through consumers' energy bills - is however important for low-carbon energy investment confidence, Greatrex said. This framework sets an annual budget for projected costs of all BEIS' low-carbon electricity levy-funded schemes until 2020/21, rising to GBP7.6 billion in 2020/21. \"Any successor mechanism needs to provide clarity as soon as possible on the period beyond 2020-21,\" Greatrex said.",
            "Spending on R&D is another welcome move, he said, and is rightly a key focus for the government's industrial strategy. The nuclear sector \"would like clarity\", he added, on the small modular reactor competition, \"to capitalise on the international interest and benefit from the supply chain and intellectual property opportunities\".",
            "The National Physical Laboratory (NPL), which is the UK's National Measurement Institute, welcomed the Clean Growth Strategy. Noting that the strategy pledges GBP460 million in the nuclear power sector, NPL said new technologies and processes will be needed to help industry reduce the cost of nuclear decommissioning.",
            "NPL is developing image-based technology to enable robots to conduct hazardous activities to reduce risk to workers; assessing the use of graphene for water decontamination and radiation detectors; and providing the reference materials and support needed to ensure that measurements of the radioactivity content of waste materials are accurate, consistent and independent.",
            "Peter Thompson, CEO of NPL, said: \"With GBP2.5 billion in investment for innovation, the government recognises the importance of excellent science and engineering to deliver extraordinary impact for the UK. We are working across the energy and environment sector to support the growth of clean industry, promote the uptake of innovation in the UK economy and enable new technologies to reduce the cost of energy and its impact on the environment. After a century as the silent partner to industry, NPL is ready to be the underpinning force that will enable the targets outlined in the Clean Growth Strategy to be successfully achieved.\""

            "How oil & gas majors could turn the tide against global warming",
            "In the early stages of the nuclear power industry, some oil & gas majors (OGMs) entered the uranium industry, but their interest in nuclear power projects is rare, with Total's bid for the Barakah project in 2009 one of the few recent examples. Are these instances historical footnotes, or might there be a role for OGMs in the nuclear power industry today, even considering the current pandemic and overall market conditions, write Amjad Ghori, Melissa Hersh, Edward Kee, Paul Murphy and Xavier Rollat.",
            "(L to R from top row) Amjad Ghori, Melissa Hersh, Edward Kee, Paul Murphy and Xavier Rollat (Image: NECG)",
            "Specifically, might technology development in the small modular reactor and advance reactor (SM&AR) space be a unique opportunity at a critical moment in time for OGMs? OGMs are awakening to the strategic, reputational, and workforce retention challenges they face if they do not take significant steps to address climate change due to the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. A decade after its Barakah bid, Total has been the target of a ground-breaking",
            "for allegedly failing to adequately fight climate change - just one example of how activist shareholders are demanding meaningful action by OGMs.",
            "Equinor has chosen to address carbon intensity, BP has incorporated a 'net-zero' policy plan and ExxonMobil has worked to develop alternative fuels. Using a technology-driven reconfiguration of asset portfolios, these OGMs are endeavouring to increase clean energy elements while reducing fossil fuel operations. By listening to their shareholders and to the public debate, changes are being made.",
            "With the role of nuclear power clearly identified as",
            "in the effort to address climate change, the underlying challenge for increasing nuclear power is how to secure investment. Two key financing problems exist.",
            "First, significant scholarship has been devoted to the idea that financing a nuclear power plant, especially the massive upfront costs, is one of the greatest challenges of its deployment. The amount of investment required in nuclear power plants to help with a clean growth strategy or a zero-carbon electricity sector is often perceived to be prohibitive. The 80% increase noted by the International Energy Agency in a",
            "last year amounts to about 220 GW, assuming that existing nuclear power does not fade. Placing more than 200 GW of new nuclear capacity into operation will require hundreds of new large nuclear power projects, as well as an even greater number of smaller nuclear reactors.",
            "Even if governments provide some support for new nuclear projects (e.g. revenue enhancements, reductions in development cost and completion risk), the amount of investment is enormous, even in a non-pandemic or post-pandemic environment, where government budgets and corporate balance sheets are under immense stress (and further exacerbated by the current economic downturn).",
            "For perspective, OGMs had more than USD80 billion in",
            "in 2018, more than twice the equity required for new nuclear investments in a year. Investment required for 200 GW of new nuclear will be at least USD1 trillion (with a capital cost of USD5000/kW). Regulated nuclear might have up to 50% of the capital cost provided by debt, but nuclear plants within deregulated electricity markets may only get 20% to 25% of capital from debt, depending on the project’s economics. This means that USD500-750 billion in equity (or about USD37.5 billion per year) will be required for this 200 GW of new nuclear power projects over 20 years.",
            "Second, one of the biggest hurdles to the development and deployment of SM&ARs is the front-end funding required to bring them to market. NuScale Power is likely to have spent more than USD1 billion by the time it receives its design certification from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. While NuScale Power is backed by Fluor, a global engineering and construction company, most SM&AR developers are not large, multi-disciplinary companies with significant financial resources/balance sheets and the requisite global reach for international deployments, except for those that are state-sponsored in certain countries.",
            "As such, SM&AR start-ups lack the financial wherewithal and project development experience to bring their technologies to market (to include the 'economies of multiples' benefit of factory-based assembly) and to achieve international deployments at the levels that will be needed to support a volume business. Notably, both the USA and the UK have engaged in cooperative funding approaches, with NuScale Power and Rolls-Royce respectively receiving funding from the US Department of Energy and UK Research and Innovation.",
            "Bringing SM&ARs to market is not simply a question of the quantum of money needed; they are beset with a unique set of investor challenges. Nuclear power plant investments have long technological development, licensing, and project development and construction periods (albeit shorter in the case of SM&ARs). This time horizon is not practical for a classic equity investor, or for very liquid financing sources such as private equity groups who are less tolerant of taking front-end risks. Instead, what is needed is an investor that is willing to play the 'long game' and is not averse to providing seed capital for new technologies, particularly in areas outside of their traditional areas of technological expertise.",
            "So, who can play the long game? Governments are one obvious choice, and the USA and UK are rolling out various support options for developing SM&ARs. Certain industrials could be another (see Fluor above). But consider:",
            "What group is under a withering attack by climate change activists?",
            "What group could make a huge difference in a sector with amounts of money that represent 'pocket change' for this group?",
            "What group can play the long game, as it looks to transition from a traditional sector that has been fundamental to modern, industrial society, but must now figure out a way to support that same society which is now looking to refashion energy and electricity in a fundamental way to combat possibly the greatest challenge to human development and well-being over the long term?",
            "What group operates on a global basis and has experience developing complex projects, involving innovative technologies, and doing so often in challenging geographic environments?",
            "OGMs would not only be well-suited to take up this charge from an investment and operations standpoint, but doing so would also be mutually beneficial to counter their perceived (and sometimes actual) climate change insouciance.",
            "If the OGMs are serious about climate change and the diversification of their portfolios that is required to transform themselves into true energy companies that have a significant business component focused on looking to offset their fossil fuel activities, then investment in SM&ARs can have a game-changing effect on the development of such technologies. The transformational impact of such a concerted decision would influence the energy industry writ large and would help to make nuclear power more accessible to, among others, the developing world. It would create innovative applications that could have further transformational effects, to include hydrogen production applications, cogeneration and desalination.",
            "Energy transformation and decarbonisation take time. For better or for worse, fossil fuel activities will still be a core component of modern living for the foreseeable future, which underscores the importance of - and immediacy of - the portfolio balancing activities of OGMs as a key contributing pathway to a sustainable future. Instead of small gestures and R&D efforts to appease environmental activists, OGMs have an opportunity to take meaningful steps by supporting the development of SM&ARs. These R&D efforts will not only improve OGMs’ reputational posture, but will actually facilitate the achievement of goals being championed by environmental groups. Interested OGMs could also consider pooling their efforts to financially support development of one or two of the more advanced SM&AR technologies to even greater effect.",
            "Considering the impact of the pandemic on oil prices and the curtailment of new investment by OGMs, a move into nuclear technology would be a major one at a time when they are under siege. Yet, it is in times of economic and corporate crisis that strategies do need to be rethought and portfolios do need to be reassessed, and that is already occurring within some OGMs, like BP.",
            "The OGMs might need an additional push. If national governments clearly articulate the place for nuclear power as part of a clean growth strategy, and then take the requisite steps to establish clear pathways for the technology and its economic viability, a convergence of interests can be created which could mobilise corporate capital that would, in turn, catapult the development and deployment of SM&ARs.",
            "OGMs have the potential to be ground-breaking leaders in bringing disruptive innovation to clean energy generation. Two years ago, Eni and Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) - a spin-out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology - signed an agreement that will allow Eni to acquire an equity stake in CFS. Eni will support CFS to develop the first commercial power plant producing energy by fusion. This involves a EUR50 million initial investment by Eni and there has been further investment from, among others, Equinor in May 2020 - in the midst of the pandemic.",
            "The hope is that more strategic partnerships like this will occur. Perhaps now a meaningful dialogue could be opened among OGMs, SM&AR developers, the nuclear industry, and interested governments and international organisations.",

            "must change to enable innovation, says panel",
            "As multiple advanced reactor vendors enter the licensing process to build first-of-a-kind demonstration projects, issues with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) current user fee cost recovery model could slow innovation and raise regulatory costs, according to a report published yesterday by the Nuclear Innovation Alliance (NIA). Reliance on applicant fees limits the ability of the NRC to hire and train staff ahead of expected applications, reducing regulatory efficiency, the report says.",
            "Clockwise: Judi Greenwald, Alex Gilbert, Stephen Burns, Caroline Cochran and Peter Hastings.",
            "The NIA describes itself as a non-profit 'think-and-do-tank' working to enable nuclear power as a global solution to mitigate climate change. Its new report -",
            "Unlocking Advanced Nuclear Innovation: The Role of Fee Reform and Public Investment",
            "- explores the history of the fee system, identifies how the fee model can inhibit advanced nuclear innovation, and makes comparisons with regulatory models in other industries and countries. It includes recommendations to strengthen the NRC, reduce barriers for advanced reactor applicants and ensure advanced reactors can provide a timely contribution to climate mitigation.",
            "finds that the NRC's current fee system \"poses a barrier\" to advanced nuclear innovation in two main ways. Firstly, it limits NRC's resources, flexibility and efficiency, a situation made worse by the fact its budget has declined by more than 30% since the mid-2010s owing to plant retirements and reduced application activity. Secondly, the open-ended costs associated with paying fees impose barriers to new entrants, since licence applicants must pay NRC fees before they begin earning revenues. Fee reform is especially important in the short term, the report says, as the \"inefficiency\" of current NRC regulations leads to higher fee expenses for near-term applications by first movers.",
            "The NIA recommends that Congress: significantly reforms, modifies or replaces the licensing fee cost recovery model to exclude or substantially reduce fees for new licence applicants at NRC; alternatively, expands options for Department of Energy funding of advanced reactor licensing; and expands funding for advanced reactor regulatory infrastructure.",
            "The NIA also recommends that the NRC take several actions to reduce the negative impacts of the fee model on nuclear innovation. Firstly, the NRC should expand the definition of activities that can be funded as advanced reactor regulatory infrastructure and seek additional funding for these activities. Secondly, the NRC should evaluate what it can do with existing authorities to defer fee collection or otherwise reduce the impacts of fees on new reactor licence applicants. More broadly, the NRC funding model should be re-evaluated to ensure that it is consistent with US climate goals.",
            "\"While the NIA did not look at the impact of current annual fees for operating nuclear power plants, the time is ripe to review how the fee model impacts the industry’s overall competitiveness, domestically and internationally,\" the report says.",
            "The report was discussed in a webinar yesterday by Alex Gilbert, NIA project manager and lead author of the report; Caroline Cochran, co-founder and COO of Oklo, which is developing the Aurora \"advanced fission power system\"; and Peter Hastings, vice president of regulatory affairs and quality at Kairos Power, which is developing fluoride salt-cooled small modular reactor technology. The webinar was moderated by former NRC commissioner Stephen Burns, who is a senior fellow at Third Way, a national think tank that \"champions modern centre-left ideas\".",
            "Opening the event, NIA Executive Director Judi Greenwald described the International Energy Agency's recently published report,",
            "Net Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector,",
            "as \"just the latest careful analysis demonstrating that we need nuclear energy to meet mid-century climate targets\". She added: \"Advanced reactors are a promising solution that could play a major role in decarbonisation but they need more policy and investment.\"",
            "Burns said the new NIA report draws attention to how the NRC's fee model can influence its ability to carry out its regulatory programme \"because there is a relative inflexibility with respect to funding that is otherwise provided by applicants for licences or reviews\".",
            "\"When you had the initial licensing and the initial development of the current fleet in the 1960s into the 1970s, you basically had a very low fee structure,\" he said. \"And so the question is, how do we model that today, or do we model that prior experience today, as providing a greater incentive to innovation.\"",
            "Gilbert said the fees structure had to be seen as part of a much larger picture of regulatory modernisation at NRC. \"If you change this part of how NRC works, then you'd have to change other parts as well, including its organisational structure and management,\" he said. \"The conversation started with the",
            "Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernisation Act",
            "(NEIMA) several years ago and we see this discussion as the next step. We're at an inflection point here in the United States and this calls for reform.\"",
            "NEIMA is one of several bipartisan bills that support advanced nuclear innovation considered by the 115th US Congress, which ended on 2 January 2019. These are: the",
            "Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act",
            "Nuclear Energy Leadership Act",
            "Nuclear Utilisation of Keynote Energy Act",
            "Advanced Nuclear Fuel Availability Act",
            "; and legislation to expedite so-called part 810 approvals, which are needed for the export of technology, equipment and components.",
            "Gilbert said it is important \"to build on the progress\" of NEIMA and NEICA.",
            "\"Nuclear technology is shifting,\" he said, from conventional large reactors to advanced smaller reactors. \"Instead of a handful of large companies, the reactor industry today has a varied composition and the NRC is shifting from prescriptive-based to performance-based licensing.\"",
            "The current fee model consists of two elements: 10 CFR Part 170 (hourly fees and includes new licence applicants, among others) - which is a discrete value of just under USD300/hour; and 10 CFR Part 171 (annual fees for existing licencees) - from where the majority of the NRC's budget comes from. CFR stands for Code of Federal Regulations.",
            "From 1990, the NRC was required to source 100% of its budget from fees, and that was reduced to 90% in the 2000s. In 2019, NEIMA changed that system to a fee and off-fee approach.",
            "Cochran said that Oklo began \"paid interactions\" with the NRC in 2016. Since then, the lowest rate that it paid and the lowest rate proposed this year for hourly fees has risen by 10%.",
            "\"So even in this span of time, we are seeing swings that are substantive,\" she said, adding that the fee structure \"hamstrings\" NRC staff themselves. \"By having the need to recoup fees but also to budget years in advance, developers like us, as well as the staff working with them, are kind of caught between a rock and hard place. Not only do we have to pay for all of it, but it has to be budgeted years in advance and approved by Congress … Whether it's 90% or 100% it's a challenging system and it's something that affects all of us who are doing hourly work.",
            "\"Annual fees for large operating plants rose by about USD500,000 for 2021, so we're definitely seeing fees going in the wrong direction if we want to encourage innovation in this space. We also don’t think that each plant closure should increase the burden on the plants that are left.\"",
            "Oklo, a privately funded company, paid USD1 million in fees to the NRC last year. Cochran also referred to the barrier presented by the \"timelag\" in federal budgeting and the time it takes to work out with NRC staff how much the regulatory cost will be, which is on top of the actual cost. She highlighted that the total NRC budget is \"not immense\", at about USD1 billion a year.",
            "Kairos, also a private company, is just four years old but has already spent about USD2 million on NRC fees. All its costs, including the acquisition of test sites have been \"on our nickel\", Hastings said.",
            "It has been involved in pre-application engagement for the last 2.5 years. This process is \"entirely optional\", he said, but will pay dividends in the form of a more efficient review of the application itself.",
            "\"We are fully committed and have stable private funding in the near term with very good prospects for future funding; we're very active in pre-application engagement and iterative development of our own test platforms, with a clear motivation to innovate and reduce programmatic risk in the furtherance of our mission to enable the world's transition to clean energy. If we weren't well-funded but still had the kinds of innovations that we bring to bear, then the cost of that engagement could clearly constitute a significant barrier to entry.\"",
            "He added; \"We're USD2 million down the road with NRC fees, but the formal application review hasn't started and that will generate plenty of additional NRC invoices in the future. It's important to note that this is for a demonstration platform that will not generate a dollar of revenue.\"",
            "Moving pre-application and application expenses \"off-fee\" in some way could stimulate innovation, he said.",
            "\"Clearly it would make sense to balance that approach with some protection, to ensure the NRC isn’t inundated with frivolous applications, or with engagements that are intended primarily to act as a market. And it's essential that moving these costs off-fee does not adversely impact the operating fee, but removing the barrier to entry could be a useful way to encourage advances in technology.\"",
            "Burns asked a question received from among the webinar's audience - What would public investment in NRC look like?",
            "Gilbert said: \"Congress appropriates the funding for NRC. That appropriation in itself would probably not change significantly. Rather, what would happen is that, instead of getting that appropriation matched to a cost recovery, this would come from the general treasury. In that sense, it would ultimately come from the taxpayer, just like we pay for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and many other types of safety regulators out there.",
            "\"On the benefit to taxpayers, these are normally projects with high economic multipliers. So, to the degree that we can encourage them, we can create economic activities that would pay those tax incomes themselves over time. It's net-balance-of-treasury accounting.\"",
            "Burns asked how government funding of a vendor for regulatory fees would benefit the public, since the NRC's sole \"product\" is a document, a certification of a design.",
            "Like Gilbert, Hastings made a comparison with the EPA. \"It's true that the NRC doesn’t produce anything other than documents, but those documents are an absolute pre-requisite to deploying the technology. The public benefit of a low-carbon baseload technology won’t exist without the licensing actions and so there's a clear benefit [to them]. The fact that it's one step removed is sort of academic.\"",

The fastest way to get more nuclear in Britain is get on with the next two units at Sizewell C. It’s a copy of Hinkley Point C, the design is approved and ready to go, and British manufacturers are experts in how to build it.

            "In a wide-ranging interview for the",
            "podcast GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s President and CEO Jay Wileman explained why nuclear has a key role in achieving carbon reduction targets, and how regulatory harmonisation between different countries could help speed that process.",
            "Jay Wileman (Image: GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy)",
            "Here is an edited transcript of parts of the",
            "podcast, which you can also listen to via the embedded player below or",
            "Nuclear energy needs to be part of the mix",
            "\"Carbon reduction is a truly global challenge. I’m an all-of-the-above kind of person so I completely agree that we ought to be maximising the use of renewable energy, but even if we do, most people agree now that you can’t get all the way to net zero without nuclear being a part of the mix. That said, nuclear still has to earn its seat at the table and to do that it's got to be cost-competitive. In addition you have to have certainty of outcome around that in both cost and time. The regulatory approval process is really, really key to that timing and to that cost. So we need to make sure that we're really focused on getting things as efficient and cost effective as we can. We've got to be reliable coming out of the gate, with high capacity factors and low outage durations.\"",
            "\"Our headquarters is in the US, but we consider ourselves a  global business. And to be able to do that, we have to integrate as we think through the life-cycle of this technology. What we really need globally is that bold leadership of governments to set energy policy so that it's well understood and predictable, and then to figure out how to develop roadmaps that recognise nuclear power's role in that energy transition. Canada has done a great job of that. The UK has said it wants 24 gigawatts of nuclear. So those type of goals and visions really help.\"",
            "Why the need for regulatory harmonisation?",
            "\"Governments really need to provide the regulators with a suitable mandate of how to participate and fulfil their mission of safety - which I absolutely want them to do - and to make sure they get them the resources, and break down any barriers that might be out there, so that they can efficiently license any and all of these designs. If nuclear is going to get that seat at the table and be able to really deliver, it's urgently needed to maximise and optimise the collaboration and cooperation between the regulators across a lot of different countries and to streamline collaborative reviews to get nuclear deployed as soon as possible. There is a great example of these fundamental requirements from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but they can be interpreted differently by the national regulators, and that leads to different design changes to your base design. And that is documented very well in the document",
            "Different Interpretations of Regulatory Requirements (DIRR).",
            "What impact does a lack of harmonisation have?",
            "\"The differences in a regulatory regime, or in interpretations of a common set of regulations, can result in regulatory uncertainty … and that is in a risk register of what you have to consider to address in your project cost and timeline for deployment. So here at GE Hitachi we are creating a standard design with our small modular reactor, the BWRX-300 will adhere to the IAEA standards that can be adapted to different regulatory regimes around the individual countries. We're looking at the ability for that set of IAEA standards to provide the roadmap that conforms with all of the different regulators around the globe. And what we want to do is to make sure that the regulators, all, when they're reading the same thing, all agree it means the same thing, rather than having different interpretations. Those differences in design review and licensing can lead to an average cost to a reactor vendor of perhaps USD250 million. So it’s something that is substantial. And that is to undertake generic licensing activities such as design certification in the US or the Generic Design Assessment (GDA) process in the UK. So when we want to build our long-term order book and be able to ramp up a global supply chain, having harmonised regulations is really a critical component.\"",
            "What is being done to promote the issue of harmonisation?",
            "\"I'm excited about the work that",
            "(World Nuclear Association’s Cooperation in Reactor Design Evaluation and Licensing working group) is doing.",
            "has 15 years of experience in this area and absolutely a wealth of knowledge … I really see",
            "as a glue between the industry and the regulators and helping to identify those gaps within all the international initiatives and in developing best practice on how to move on harmonisation and move it to the next step. I like to see",
            "working with the IAEA's nuclear harmonisation and standardisation initiative NHSI.\"",
            "\"All small modular reactors are really based on the concept of repetition, of modularisation. So doing the same thing well over and over again. This means that any design changes that are imposed by different interpretations of the regulatory requirement may very well impact the design or size or features of some of those modules, and when you think about that, it makes getting to the 'Nth of a kind' deployment pretty tough. So one of the examples from the DIRR report I mentioned earlier was a requirement from the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation to add HEPA (high efficiency particulate absorbing) filters to the reactor building on the design of our ABWR. That’s a classic example where something that really seemed like a good idea from a safety perspective, but doesn't demonstrate to have any overall increase in the safety of the plant, takes a lot of the rector vendor and the regulatory time and adds cost and duration to that budget.\"",
            "Are there emerging signs of harmonisation?",
            "\"Yes, we're watching it live right now. For us at GE Hitachi, we're making great progress in building and licensing the first commercial SMR project in North America and taking that to deploy globally. So I applaud the cooperation between the CNSC (in Canada) and the US NRC in reviewing the BWRX-300. There's a lot of design reviews that will be required to go through these processes and for those two regulators to cooperate is a great way to overcome the challenge. I also saw in the news recently we now have collaboration between CNSC and the ONR (in the UK) as well, so that's another side of the triangle that will really help to be able to have a common understanding and common design reviews where they're collaborating, while still maintaining the sovereignty that's required for each of the countries. As an industry, not just GE HItachi, but all vendors really need that collaboration between the regulators and we've seen the further step up from the IAEA with the NHSI initiative. So I'm excited, I see things moving and we have just got to go faster and faster.\"",
            "Is the goal to get to a place where, like an aircraft, the approval covers multiple countries?",
            "\"That would be Nirvana, but I'll take good harmonisation as step one toward that. I think that is a necessary precursor, to get to there, if we ever do. But again, it's all about regulatory path, certainty and understanding what those requirements are, and having them shown to be the same, so that you've reduced your cost and schedule in that process.\"",
            "\"I'm not going to be able to just copy and paste and replace ‘CNSC’ with ‘NRC’. They'll clearly have some different work, and that's OK. It's really when you get to the heart of how a regulation is interpreted and then the follow on …  that is what drives the differences. So we’d love to get there, but this harmonisation effort is a good step forward.”",
            "What should we look out for in the year ahead?",
            "“2023 is going to be a great and busy year. For the BWRX-300 in Canada we expect to complete our vendor design review process and then continue through the licensing and engineering process with our customer OPG. That's for the BWRX-300 at the Darlington site, and that’s where we anticipate construction could be completed as soon as 2028. So great to see a launch of this technology. In the US, we're working with our customer TVA on the licensing of the first commercial SMR in the United States, and we're working with them to complete the construction permit application and move forward. So again, really excited for North America and a lot of synergies between those projects as well, not just on the project, but of course the NRC and CNSC collaboration. In the UK we've submitted the generic design assessment application for the BWRX-300 and we're starting to work on the GDA, so a lot of activities and again a lot of synergies between the regulators there. In Poland, Orlen Synthos Green Energy has started the pre-licensing process for the BWRX-300 there - they plan on deploying a fleet of the 300s with the first unit by the end of this decade. So a lot of activity again, one more regulator in the PAA there, that is a great opportunity to leverage a lot of the IAEA NHSI and the",
            "work, and we're happy to be just right in the middle of that. And we also have MoU's outstanding with Czech Republic and Sweden and others. I'm really excited about what's going to happen and the acceleration we're going to get in this project in 2023.\"",
            "How will the nuclear energy sector look by 2060?",
            "\"Our target is for net zero by 2050. If we have that sense of urgency and we continue to value the need for more and more electricity, but carbon-free electricity, so that our children and grandchildren and great grandchildren, can have a great planet here, we've got a lot of work to do. So I would love to see 2060 as a continuation of what we have achieved in 2050 - just continuing to bring forward these small modular reactors, Gen 4 reactors and, who knows, fusion might even be possible by then. We will see, but there's a lot of work to do to go through the next couple of decades. And that'' what I'm thinking about in leading GE Hitachi. You know the work we're doing, yes it's to serve our customers today operating very reliably the zero emission 24/7 energy secure installed base today. But really, the play is for the future, to help us achieve everything that we're planning on.\"",

            "Polina Lion on Rosatom's ESG policies",
            "Following the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, Polina Lion, the chief sustainability officer for Russia's nuclear energy corporation Rosatom, outlines the company's ESG strategy.",
            "What is your background and how have you come to be doing the job of chief",
            "sustainability officer for Rosatom?",
            "I have a masters degree in economics, and my 20-year career has been predominantly in the field of strategy and business process management. Recognising the growing importance of corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) transformation for business development, I accepted an offer five years ago to build ESG expertise at Rosatom. I firmly believe that ESG is a new strategic imperative for international companies.",
            "How big a role do you see nuclear energy and nuclear technology playing in tackling",
            "carbon emissions and climate change?",
            "Decarbonisation has to be a global priority to combat climate change, and we firmly advocate for nuclear power as a key solution. Nuclear energy, like wind power, has no direct CO2 emissions. For example, in Russia nuclear power plants help prevent more than 100 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year, that is 7% of the total country’s greenhouse gas emissions. There is a consensus among international experts that without nuclear energy the Paris Agreement goal cannot be reached. The IEA’s June 2022 reminder underscores that without nuclear energy, achieving sustainable and clean energy systems becomes not only challenging, but also riskier and economically burdensome. The recent International Atomic Energy Agency projection for 2050 emphasises the pressing need for an 120% increase in nuclear electricity production capacity compared with current levels and at COP28 more than 120 companies, including Rosatom, signed the Net Zero Nuclear industry pledge of a goal of tripling global nuclear generation by 2050. While meeting these targets is essential for our net-zero climate goals, substantial challenges arise, particularly in securing the necessary investments for nuclear energy. To put it into financial perspective, achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 requires a more than two-fold increase in annual electricity sector investment between 2023 and 2030, with an estimated annual allocation of USD100 billion specifically for nuclear energy. I believe that financial institutions should reconsider their policies toward nuclear energy projects. Green and ESG-financing should become more accessible for nuclear energy projects - both large-capacity nuclear power plants and small modular reactors (SMRs). Sustainability is a core focus for Rosatom, with projects spanning more than 50 countries worldwide. We actively align our product portfolio with the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Over the past five years, we have observed a significant increase in the demand for ESG quality in business operations, a trend that continues to grow. It is evident that ESG and climate considerations have evolved into fundamental requirements for conducting business on a global scale.",
            "What sort of initiatives are taking place in Rosatom?",
            "We put forth efforts to integrate ESG requirements into every aspect of Rosatom’s business and since 2021, we have commissioned ecological monitoring and expeditions to explore the Arctic’s ecology and biodiversity specifics as part of developing the Northern Sea Route maritime navigation. We have made significant efforts to include nuclear energy in the Russian green taxonomy, attracting ESG financing for nuclear power plant construction totaling more than USD3 billion (300 billion Russian rubles). We have advocated for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the national green certificates system currently under development in Russia. The system is set to launch in early 2024, and green nuclear certificates will be available for companies interested in offsetting their greenhouse gas footprint with zero-emission energy. We also keep an eye on our general ESG performance. For the past four years, we have conducted an annual ESG rating procedure, with an obligatory lessons-learned segment where we analyse the results of the rating and elaborate a plan for practical steps to improve these outcomes. We initiated this practice with the independent rating agency Vigeo Eiris in 2020 and continue with the Russian rating agency AKRA. While we have consistently obtained a high score, there is always room for improvement in sustainable development performance. Given the urgency to prevent irreversible climate change, all low-carbon energy sources should be part of the efforts to decarbonise the global economy. Clean, low-carbon nuclear energy complements renewables to create a low-carbon energy mix for our planet. As such, Rosatom is developing its green product portfolio, focusing on sustainable clean energy solutions. We are already one of the major players in Russian wind energy, having commissioned about 1 GW of capacity with plans to increase it to 1.7 GW by 2027. There is a demand for Rosatom wind energy parks abroad. For example, this year we have signed agreements with the Ministry of Energy of Kyrgyzstan and the Republic of Myanmar. We also develop energy storage solutions for the auto industry and the power grid complex, with significant technological capacity in hydrogen energy development. We are also committed to expanding the application of closed nuclear fuel cycle technologies and solutions to ensure the safe storage of radioactive waste. In early November, the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant celebrated the one-year anniversary of its groundbreaking transition to MOX fuel in the BN-800 fast neutron reactor. This significant milestone marked a major step toward a sustainable, closed nuclear fuel cycle.",
            "How has international ESG collaboration changed since February 2022?",
            "I used to say that climate issues have no borders. We need to keep the global dialogue working on climate and ESG issues to align the efforts of different companies and countries. We take part in the IAEA and some other international organisations' working groups on ESG and climate issues, and we participate in international events like COP28.",
            "For example, World Nuclear Association has launched an ESG Working Group, and we are considering elaborating a voluntary ESG standard for nuclear energy projects based on the ISSB framework to encourage ESG financing for the nuclear sector. Without joint efforts, there will be no sustainable solutions.",
            "This year Rosatom conducted several events in the official blue zone of COP28 and on the sidelines, presenting progress in SMR projects development, our integrated approach to developing sustainable clean energy systems in different areas, and discussing the next generation demand for clean energy solutions. It’s essential to remember that COP is a site for official UN country negotiations, with COP28 negotiations dedicated to reviewing interim results of progress toward the Paris Agreement goals and performing specific climate mechanisms. It is time to turn from sound declarations to practical steps in the fight against climate change.",
            "Do you think it is still possible to achieve climate change goals?",
            "Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change",
            "and scientific research, the increase in global temperatures is now approaching the previously agreed-upon 1.5°C, and reaching this critical turning point will have devastating consequences for the planet. I am an optimist and believe that there is still a chance, as many countries and companies are genuinely concerned about climate change. However, we need to unite our efforts for success. Russia is the world’s fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions. We understand that our efforts as a country matter. Rosatom is one of the world’s leading nuclear energy companies, and we recognise that our efforts as a company matter. The future of greenhouse gas emissions will largely depend on development trends in the world economy, green technologies, and transformations in human behaviour.",
            "What developments do you think are needed?",
            "The challenges posed by the climate agenda are global and exceedingly difficult to address. It is crucial that countries and companies align their efforts. Alongside the mantra “we need to act right now”, there is a pressing need for harmonising climate regulations along with corresponding national policies and mechanisms across different countries. Clean, low-carbon nuclear energy should be explicitly included in national green taxonomies with extensive and clear parameters to facilitate access to green financing for nuclear power plants and small modular reactor projects. National carbon markets should be opened and harmonised for international trade exchanges. Both national and international green energy certificate systems should recognise and incorporate nuclear energy, as it is an integral part of the clean energy mix for the future. Maintaining an ongoing international dialogue is essential to exchange best practices in climate solutions, making the path toward a global net-zero more sustainable and effective."

            "NexGen Energy's Leigh Curyer on uranium project's potential",
            "In an interview for the World Nuclear News podcast NexGen Energy CEO and President Leigh Curyer set out the path ahead for what he calls their world-leading project in Canada, and gave his overview of the uranium sector's prospects.",
            "Here is an edited transcript of parts of the",
            "podcast, which you can also listen to via the embedded player below or",
            "We founded NexGen Energy in 2011 and acquired a number of exploration properties in the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan. The deposits in the Athabasca Basin are on average 100 times the grade of the current grade of world production so you're looking for very high grade deposits, but they're very difficult to find. We were very fortunate after looking at a 30-year history of exploration in the area and then applying some new geophysical surveys over the land package we targeted a number of zones in that southwestern side of the basin and on our 21st drill hole on the property, but the very first drill hole on this particular target, we hit mineralisation. It wasn't until mid-2014, about six months after that discovery hole, that we we then hit an intercept which at the time was about the fourth best hole in uranium exploration history from a width-times-grade perspective - that hole is no longer in the top 20, the other holes [which have superseded it] are all hosted by the Arrow discovery. At that time we knew we had something incredibly significant. We knew it was one of the world's best deposits, and it certainly has turned into the world's best deposit from a grade, size and also technical environmental setting.",
            "How long will it take to get to production?",
            "Mining does take many years and we have just hit the 10 year anniversary from that discovery. We received our Saskatchewan provincial environmental approval in November and we're confident that we will receive the federal permit in the very near future. The timeline on construction is estimated to be 42 months from that point in time. If we were to receive the federal permit in 2024, you would expect production at the end of 2027, early 2028. So from discovery through to production, you're looking around 14 or 15 years.",
            "Innovative approaches to the licensing and permitting side",
            "Our approach has been, first of all, understanding what is required to be permitted. So even before we submitted our original project description, we put a lot of work into understanding the permitting process in Canada, the level of validation required around the technical, the environmental and the social aspects of environmental approval. And we ran that process provincially in Saskatchewan, in parallel to the federal approval process in Canada. The fact is, the environmental impact study, is primarily the same document, both provincially and federally, and there's licensing as well as the environmental approval which we have run in parallel. We've had that benefit of having a well understood ore body, it's incredibly hard rock, so it's very easy to extract ... we don't have deleterious metals once we get the ore to the surface to then deal with, so it has been innovative in that sense that we've run a few a number of streams in parallel and have received validation around it with the granting of the provincial approval. And we're confident we're about to receive that federally as well.",
            "The uranium market and its impact on NexGen Energy",
            "Over the last year or two it has certainly been quite lively after a long dormant period. A lot of people have asked me how it feels to discover the world's best project in one of the world's worst markets. And from my perspective, and also the team's perspective at NexGen, that was OK with us because it actually allowed us to get on with developing the project to the stage that we have, without being distracted with all the market noise that happens with a rising uranium price. It's been 10 years since discovery and in that time, up until the last two years, the uranium market has been pretty quiet. Our confidence was that this market was always coming, with respect to demand increasing, yet mined supply is the most fragile it's ever been and the costs of producing from those current mines are going up substantially ... this has been building since 2011 and and you just can't turn on mined supply overnight - we've got one of the simplest projects technically on the planet, and yet it's still going to be a 15-year process from discovery through to actual production. We weren't the only ones to recognise it - uranium fund holders such as Yellow Cake in the UK and Sprott Uranium Trust in North America, they saw the Western world's leading producers buying spot pounds on the market because it was cheaper than those mines could produce it themselves - and when do you ever see that in a commodity, let alone an energy commodity, so they recognised the trade and started buying. They have also been correct. I think the fundamentals are now locked in for uranium for longer than they weren't. Our project, which will be the world's largest, at about 25% of the world's mined supply, is just replacing mined supply that is expected to come off between now and when we're in production. 30 million pounds is what our feasibility engineering study has scheduled and that's coming from a very tiny mine. We are moving the ore [equivalent to the volume] of about one double decker bus, one and a half double decker buses a day - that's a reflection of the incredible grade.",
            "How long will the supply last?",
            "As per the feasibility study, which only takes into account the measured and indicated resources, that's 10.7 years. We have another 80 million pounds in an inferred resource. And now it's inferred just through the drill density is at 50 metre spacing, to get it into the measured and indicated, you need to bring that down to 15 to 25 metres. Now that ore will convert as has the balance of the deposit. And then we also have a number of other mineralisation zones in and around Arrow and particularly under Arrow where we've hit more mineralisation but yet to define it because it's under Arrow and it's deep. We have permitted for an initial 24-year mine life. And that permit timeline reflects our confidence in the deposit just in and around Arrow. We discovered it with the first drill hole within a four and a half kilometre radius. We obviously knew what we were doing, no doubt about that. But did we find the only motherlode in the area? I don't think so. We know we have more mineralisation as well. And so we've just recently kicked off our 2024 exploration programme, where we are looking for new Arrow-type zones within an economic distance of the Arrow deposit. So all of that signifies our approach to getting a 24-year initial mine licence.",
            "We did experience as a company the demand for our ore going forward, the interest from utilities in the US, Europe, Japan, other parts of Asia increased substantially with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So I think from an ESG perspective, we're becoming even more preferable with respect to a safe, reliable and socially acceptable source of supply, given the environmental benignness of our mine, but also the location as well.",
            "How much of your proposed production have you already got customers for?",
            "We're currently fully levered to future prices, we have not locked in any pounds of production yet. Once we have visibility on the precise timing of production with the federal approval, we will then start entering into those contracts. But with utilities in the US, Europe, Asia, the Middle East as well ... we've been in dialogue for primarily the last three years and the frequency of those discussions have elevated even in the last three months.",
            "What about the wider outlook for the nuclear sector?",
            "Having been in the sector since 2002 I'm just really pleased that the European Union came out and officially designated nuclear as clean, green and safe relative to any baseload, carbon-emitting form of energy. You saw the UK government really invest heavily in the development of their nuclear programme, the US government have also done it with the Inflation Reduction Act. I think it just reflects that people who are sensible about energy policy have recognised that the merits of nuclear are now based on the scientific fact as opposed to some of the false political ideologies that have been generated around nuclear energy.",
            "What about the picture in Australia?",
            "Having lived in Australia, I think Australia is one of the toughest opinion markets in the world around nuclear energy. We're going to take delivery of nuclear-powered submarines through AUKUS, and I think you are going to see a small modular reactor developed in Australia probably in that 2030 decade, because the realisation around sensible energy policy, if you want carbon-free based low power, it has to be nuclear energy. The last public opinion poll I reviewed had more than half of the population supporting nuclear energy to be developed in Australia ... I think that reflects the scientific appreciation of nuclear as opposed to some of those false ideologies that were generated in the 1960s and 1970s.",
            "What is the latest NexGen Energy news?",
            "During the podcast interview, Curyer said exploration teams were working hard, and said there would be updates in the months ahead. And since the episode was published, NexGen Energy",
            "the discovery of new intense uranium mineralisation on its SW2 Property, 3.5 kilometres east of the Arrow Deposit. In a news release Curyer said \"this new intercept reflects the high potential of NexGen's extensive land package in the south-western section of the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, and is a testament to the strategic and disciplined approach to identifying new Arrow-type zones of mineralisation. Drilling activity is being fully dedicated to this new discovery area to advance our understanding of scope and scale of mineralisation\".",

This was the message of the country’s delegation to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s 60th General Conference being held this week in Vienna. The delegation included specialists in nuclear education, research, design, fuel, policy, law and finance.",
            "Greg Hands, minister of state for international trade in the British government, said in a statement for World Nuclear News: “The UK has one of the most dynamic nuclear markets in the world, with significant new build and waste and decommissioning programmes.  We are open for investment, as emphasised by our recent decision on the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, and are extremely well placed to continue taking on work internationally across the nuclear life cycle.”",
            "The UK delegation is being led by Robin Grimes, who is both chief scientific adviser to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and professor of materials physics at Imperial College.",
            "Grimes told WNN: “We have a long, 60-year history in nuclear and experience of all facets of the nuclear technologies. We are also one of the first nations to enter into the decommissioning process and because we had such a large reactor build early on, we are perhaps a little further along in that process. So we’re useful people to talk to. We are also very clear in our commitments to safety security and safeguards and that is helpful for sharing best practice.”",
            "In his statement to the IAEA General Conference on 28 September, Grimes included the scientific importance of research to the UK’s endeavours in nuclear. Grimes, who runs the Nuclear Academics Network - which is supported by the Research Councils UK Energy Programme - stressed the importance of continued collaboration with his European peers.",
            "“The UK's National Nuclear Laboratory is at the forefront of our nuclear programmes, providing strategic technical advice to government and working with Britain's nuclear sector to drive innovative technologies for the clean-up and decommissioning of the UK's nuclear legacy, perform vital post-irradiation examination to enable safe reactor operations, and undertake research with academics who are addressing advanced nuclear technologies.",

Deploying expertise developed for JET, the Authority also contributes to fission and other markets with facilities and R&D for irradiated materials, remote handling and tritium. Our national laboratories are also supported by a strong university based nuclear academic community.",

The NDA works collaboratively with a number of international counterparts and remains committed to sharing our expertise and advice in this area.”",
            "The outcome of the EU Referendum has, however, created uncertainty - both in terms of opportunities for students and the work of UK academics on European nuclear research projects funded by Horizon 2020. This is the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme ever with nearly €80 billion of funding available between 2014 and 2020.",
            "John Roberts, nuclear fellow at The University of Manchester, told WNN: “The government has promised it will pay the funding up until the end of current projects, but nuclear is an international collaborative effort. We don’t know what the impact of the UK leaving the European Union on that collaboration will be.”",
            "Roberts is involved with a project that increases the mobility of nuclear students and lecturers throughout Europe - the European Nuclear Education Network. This allows students to earn credits in a nuclear discipline outside of their host country to gain the extra qualification of the European Master of Science in Nuclear Engineering.",
            "EU funding for nuclear-related subjects in UK universities is spread across education and research projects which develops partnerships with many EU universities and organisations, Roberts said. “Participation in these projects promotes our visibility within Europe and this continuity ensures we can be influential in determining nuclear research and education priorities.”",
            "For example, The University of Manchester helped outline the mission of the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNETP), which was launched in 2007, and Roberts has been chairing SNETP’s Education, Training and Knowledge Management committee for the last two years. “We’ve been involved since the start and therefore have a voice across major European policy for nuclear education,” he said.",

            "“British government policy to support new build nuclear projects is seen as ground-breaking and a number of countries are looking to the UK to learn and to follow its lead. The system of Contracts-for-Difference, together with a government guarantee to protect the debt financiers, is seen as key to developing nuclear and other low-carbon projects.",

Legal, financial and advisory professionals have long been seen as world leaders in the project financing of energy and infrastructure projects around the globe. Nuclear is no different with many new build projects looking to the UK for advice.”",

In addition to asking about our AP1000 plant construction projects - the first of which is currently in the hot functional test phase prior to fuel load - they always want to know about the progress of the three nuclear new build projects in the UK,” he said.",

            "“The UK provides a tremendous reference market for counties considering nuclear new build and benchmarks can be taken from an efficient operating fleet, independent licensing of new nuclear technologies, electricity market reform to support clean energy projects, development of the supply chain for future construction projects, financing and many more. British companies working on nuclear new build will be well placed to take the experience gained on all phases of the UK projects, from planning to commissioning, and use this to help other nations develop their programmes.”",
            "Claire Harvey, senior commercial and nuclear lawyer at Prospect Law, noted that the UK’s energy policy is to expand its “low-carbon contribution”.",
            "Harvey told WNN: “Nuclear will play a key role in this and there are plans to build up to 16GW(e) of nuclear capacity over the coming years. Plans to develop the Hinkley Point reactor are well-advanced, and others are in development and going through the regulatory process. The UK recognises that such nuclear expansion can’t take place without the issue of the long-term management of its radioactive waste being adequately addressed, and it is actively seeking a solution to this. In addition, it is also looking at the future use of small modular reactor technology through a £250 million ($325 million) research programme sponsored by government.”",
            "She added: “The UK has a breadth of experience covering nuclear new build, and waste management and decommissioning of its older facilities. Underpinning this is a robust nuclear regulatory system based on sound laws and regulation derived from the IAEA’s Safety Fundamentals and Safety Requirements.",
            "“Specialist legal support is available to newcomer countries from experienced nuclear law firms such as Prospect Law, who can work with local law firms to develop nuclear laws and regulations specific for a particular country. And because the UK does not manufacture reactors we are more independent than most when it comes to providing regulatory and legal advice to newcomer countries.”",
            "The UK delegation to the IAEA General Conference also includes representatives of Burges Salmon LLP, Lloyds Register Energy and Urenco."

            "Nuclear industry leaders today outlined the concrete steps they are taking to help reach the goal of the Harmony initiative - to achieve a 25% share of world electricity production by 2050 through the addition of 1000 GWe of new capacity. Launched three years ago, Harmony encompasses three objectives - a level playing field for all clean-energy sources of electricity, harmonised regulatory processes, and an effective safety paradigm.",
            "Kirill Komarov speaking today (Image: World Nuclear Association)",
            "World Nuclear Association Symposium 2018",
            "in London, the Association’s current chairman, Kirill Komarov, stressed the purpose of this year’s event.",
            "“The reason we have gathered here is to discuss how the global community could create the environment in which the Harmony plans for a 1000 GWe of new nuclear capacity by 2050, could become a reality,” Komarov told delegates. “We all understand that there is no sustainable future without nuclear as it is one of the most efficient, environmentally friendly energy sources, which provides electricity in a resilient and sustainable manner.”",
            "Komarov, who is first deputy director-general for corporate development and international business at Russia’s Rosatom, noted the “numerous achievements and breakthroughs” for World Nuclear Association over the past year.",
            "“We achieved a heightened level of recognition on the international nuclear arena. New members joined from all over the world, including organisations from Egypt and Bangladesh. This creates value for all existing WNA members and proves the Association’s reputation as a truly global body. It also lays the foundation for the industry to reach the Harmony goal,” he said.",
            "The Association has also managed to reach policy makers directly, especially in countries embarking on a nuclear power programme. As an illustration, he said a very successful",
            "conference had been held in Indonesia alongside high-level meetings with government officials. The Association is currently working with the next two candidates for hosting the",
            "- Kazakhstan and Poland, he added. The Association’s director general, Agneta Rising, had also directly addressed the Bulgarian parliament as it considers proceeding with plans for additional reactors.",
            "“In other words, it seems that governments around the world are increasingly approaching the Association,” Komarov said, and international organisations too have shown they are increasingly keen to work with it. He highlighted new cooperation with the World Energy Congress and the UN Economic Commission for Europe.",
            "“Notwithstanding the fact that the larger organisations, of which these are part, have been traditionally reluctant to acknowledge the role of nuclear in addressing the climate and energy challenges, the Harmony programme opens up new opportunities for surging ahead together,” he said.",
            "Rising placed the urgency of the Harmony goal into the context of the heatwave affecting countries around the world this summer.",
            "“North, south, east and west were super-heated. For the first time, it was everywhere,” she said. This brought home the fact that emitting more and more greenhouse gases can make such extreme weather events weather events much more common, she added.",
            "“We have to replace fossil fuels as the driving force of our world. We must stop burning them for electricity, and for heat, and also for transport. We need deep decarbonisation and we need to use all today’s clean energy forms beyond their normal deployment for electricity generation. What happens when you make decarbonisation the goal? [A] UN supported study brings the answer: It is a large role for nuclear power,” Rising said.",
            "Working with 16 countries, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network set decarbonisation in line with the Paris Agreement’s 2 Degree target as the goal. Each country used their own assumptions about technologies and domestic resources.",
            "They did not all use nuclear, Rising noted, and yet the clean energy mix they account for totals 21% nuclear electricity. And a total of 1053 GW of new nuclear build by 2050, for the countries that represent three-quarters.",
            "“Does that sound familiar?” she asked delegates, referring to Harmony. “We are glad to see this varied study, that included a range of social, political, geographic and technical assumptions conclude as we all have, that nuclear is an essential part of any clean future energy mix.”",
            "On progress towards the Harmony target, Rising highlighted the launch last week of the Association’s third annual edition of the",
            "World Nuclear Performance Report",
            "“As we pass the milestones of 450 operable reactors worldwide and approach the milestone of a total of 400 GWe capacity installed, the performance of the global fleet remains strong with an average capacity factor over 81% - a high we have maintained for 20 years,” she said.",
            "The importance of safety the industry is committed to was proven yesterday, she said, during the earthquake on Japan’s island of Hokkaido, where the Tomari nuclear plant experienced a power outage and was forced to switch to emergency generators. The plant is safe with mobile diesel generators keeping it cool, she said.",
            "Seven new reactors have been connected to the grid in the last year, with China’s Haiyang 2 expected to next week. These connections have added EPR and AP1000 units to the list of advanced reactors in operation, alongside APR-1400 and VVER-1200 reactors, she said.",
            "“The longest run of growth since 2002 has seen nuclear power generation increase for the fifth year running to surpass 2500 TWh again. That’s 10.5% of global electricity demand and we have been building at the fastest rate of construction in 25 year,” she said, adding that the average construction time for a large reactor was only four years and ten months.",
            "As many as 25 new units are already online or scheduled to be in the 2018-2019 period. This, Rising said, puts the industry “broadly on track” to achieve the Harmony goal.",
            "There has been an increasing acknowledgement of nuclear power by policy makers, she said, such as through the Clean Energy Ministerial, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the International Energy Agency and the UN Economic Commission for Europe.",
            "“As the global nuclear industry’s one and only vision for the future of electricity, Harmony has caught the attention and the imagination of policy makers and begun to open doors for this industry.”",
            "Executives from Russian, Chinese and French nuclear power companies each outlined the ways in which Harmony is part of their strategy.",
            "Evgeny Pakermanov, president of Rusatom Overseas, highlighted the importance of international collaboration, particularly in work on innovative technologies.",
            "Rusatom Overseas is a subsidiary of Rosatom, which has commissioned 13 new nuclear power units over the last 11 years, in China, India, Iran and Russia. Its current VVER portfolio includes 35 units. It has 60 units in operation and 41 at the project implementation stage. Novovoronezh II-1 - Rosatom’s first Gen III+ VVER Design - started commercial operation in February last year, and its second, Leningrad II-1 was grid connected in March this year.",
            "Pakermanov described small modular reactor technology as “a truly innovative solution” both on land and at sea. Rosatom has 400 reactor years of experience in nuclear icebreakers, he said, and its",
            "will next year become the world’s first floating nuclear power plant to be commissioned. Next year, Rosatom will also commission the first nuclear icebreaker to be fully built in modern-day Russia.",
            "is the first of three vessels of Project 22220 which will be able to break through ice 3 meters thick as they escort vessels across the Arctic Ocean.",
            "Work to close the nuclear fuel cycle, with the recycling of used nuclear fuel, is “the future of world nuclear energy”, Pakermanov said. For Rosatom, this includes MBIR - the multipurpose sodium-cooled fast neutron research reactor that is under construction at the site of the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors at Dmitrovgrad. This high-flux fast test reactor has “unique capabilities” and will be open to international participation, Pakermanov said. The same applies, he said, to the International Centre for Neutron Research - based on a high-flux research reactor PIK.",
            "Rosatom commissioned the BN-800 fast neutron reactor at the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant in 2015 and work on the design of the “next Step” - BN-1200 - is nearing completion, he said.",
            "Russia and China intend to develop long-term cooperation in fast neutron reactor technologies and will work together on a floating nuclear power plant, he said.",
            "“The opportunities for partnerships and cooperation are much bigger than for competition,” he said. “Strong collaboration is a key driver for us to move towards a better future together.”",
            "Wang Binghua, chairman of State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation (SNPTC) described China’s 30-year journey from nuclear power newcomer to its position now as a “world-class” reactor vendor and “self-reliant” across the entire nuclear fuel cycle.",
            "China has 42 units in operation with a total installed capacity of 42.44 GWe, ranking fourth in the world. It has 15 units under construction with a total installed capacity of 16.3 GWe, ranking first in the world. China generated a total of 247.5 TWh of nuclear power last, ranking third in the world. Ten Gen-III PWR units, one high-temperature gas-cooled reactor and one fast reactor that feature Gen-IV technology are under construction, he noted.",
            "“China has established a complete nuclear fuel and equipment manufacturing industry, providing 8-10 sets of the main equipment for GW-class Gen-III PWRs every year,” he said. “By 2020, the installed capacity of nuclear power will reach 58 GWe, with 30 GWe under construction and the total capacity of nuclear power units in operation is expected to reach 150 GWe by 2035,” he added.",
            "Over the next ten to 15 years, China will “present a technological landscape dominated by proprietary Gen-III reactors and supported by other advanced nuclear energy systems,” he said.",
            "China is actively exploring the application of nuclear energy on land, at sea and in space, as well as for heating, seawater desalination and hydrogen production, he said.",
            "SNPTC designed China’s first PWR - Qinshan - and China’s first exported nuclear power plant - Chashma in Pakistan. It is the controlling stakeholder in Hongyanhe nuclear power plant in Liaoning Province and in Haiyang nuclear power plant, which is one of the first Gen-III passive PWR AP1000 projects.",
            "The Chinese design CAP1400 is now “the world’s largest passive PWR nuclear power plant with the highest safety class”, he said. This design comprises an availability of 93%, a refueling cycle of 18 months, an average discharge burnup above 52,000 MWd/tU and may be safely operated without operator intervention in the event of an accident for 72 hours.",
            "Binghua said he would “echo” the words of Rising in calling for more nuclear power to be installed to help reduce global emissions. China pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60-65% from 2005 levels under a plan submitted to the United Nations three years ago.",
            "“For the Chinese government, the development of nuclear power isn’t simply about meeting energy demand but also about the development of the whole energy structure. We need a certain amount of time to decrease thermal power generation from 65% to a reasonable level and during this process nuclear power has an important role,” he said.",
            "Bernard Fontana, CEO of Framatome, stressed the importance of skills, “both in the here and now and how we plan for new generations”.",
            "“I believe this is our contribution to the Harmony programme. We are a 100% nuclear company following a skills and competency approach. The financial aspect comes second to skills,” he said.",
            "Framatome is a French reactor business created in January this year when Areva NP was sold off, following Areva's bankruptcy. It is owned by EDF, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Assystem. It designs, manufactures, and installs components, fuel and instrumentation and control systems for nuclear power plants and offers a full range of reactor services. It has 14,000 employees worldwide and holds around 3500 patents covering some 680 inventions. It operates on more than 250 reactors worldwide.",
            "“Every time there is a new nuclear reactor, we are committed to support it over 60, 70, 80 years. That is a commitment to long-term nuclear skills,” Fontana said.",
            "This commitment includes a digitisation programme, he said, which enhances the company’s ability to serve customers as well as to increase safety and efficiency.",
            "“There are more people working on documents for the safety guarantee of equipment than there are working on the technology,” he said.",
            "With the French government aiming to reduce the share of nuclear in the country’s electricity mix from 75% to 50%, Fontana said that for as long as there is no solution to energy storage, baseload electricity supply will be required.",
            "Commitment to nuclear power is a commitment to the future, he said, “which is why we are able to attract people for the whole of their professional lives. And it’s why our industry is so exciting.”",

            "podcast, which you can also listen to via the embedded player below or",
            "On the general world situation and nuclear:",
            "\"I’m not sure I've seen as complicated a geopolitical situation as there is now around the world ... we were feeling tailwinds for nuclear even a couple years ago with the race to decarbonise and electrify and the race to net-zero. But then since February this year, with the Russians moving into Ukraine, the whole issue of energy security has really come to the fore, especially in Europe, but around the world.",
            "\"As far as Cameco goes, we went through a very difficult period I would say post-Fukushima, 10 years where there was too much uranium, too much nuclear fuel around. Things were looking not as good for nuclear, but they've really picked up now and and I could probably name you 20 countries that in the past 12 months have done a complete U-turn on nuclear and are now looking at expanding their fleets or bringing on reactors or SMRs perhaps. So it's a real positive story for nuclear and we have a big role to play in the energy security and clean air segments going forward.\"",
            "\"I think we've been very clear with our strategy for almost a decade now. It's a strategy of discipline that we will not produce uranium just to spray it into the spot market, because we saw how that worked. It doesn't work - it doesn't work for anyone. We lost some of our competitors over it, who were producing into a spot market that fell as low as USD17 per pound in 2017. We said we're only going to produce into the contracts we have and so that meant, for us, taking some really tough medicine. Back in 2016, we shut down our Rabbit Lake mine. We shut down Wyoming, Nebraska and then in 2017 we shut down the world’s largest high-grade mine and mill McArthur River/Key Lake because the world didn't need the uranium and no one else seemed to be stepping up, so we did that. We left over 100 million pounds in the ground at USD17 ... We maintained our supply discipline and today we have a better market. It's better, good enough that we can bring our big McArthur River/Key Lake production centre back into production at reduced levels that will match our sales, and so we'll continue with that as our sales grow, we'll bring on more production, but we will remain very, very disciplined from a production and a marketing point of view ... You'll see some production out of McArthur and Key Lake later this quarter. In the fourth quarter.”",
            "On the Cameco-Westinghouse deal",
            "\"We think the timing is really good. As I said, we've seen some real strong tailwinds coming for nuclear. We could see nuclear coming back as a tool in the toolkit for energy security around the world and so first we looked after our own operations. We made sure we were ready to go and we're restarting, as I say, McArthur River/Key Lake. Cigar Lake’s running well. Our Kazakh operations are running well. Our fuel services conversion in Ontario is really doing well, so we started looking for other things in our area. We're not straying outside of nuclear. Westinghouse was out there and we started looking at it with Brookfield, who was the owner and just a different entity of Brookfield - their Clean Energy Transition Fund - wanted to get involved and we said, 'well, that's brilliant'. Seeing nuclear as clean energy, them buying in, staying in, and then us coming along as a strategic partner and it just made perfect sense. So it took us about six months of due diligence and negotiations. And we think we found the right timing, the right partner and the right project. So we're super excited about the future of Westinghouse.”",
            "The news that Westinghouse was a successful bidder in Poland for its nuclear programme \"is just icing on the cake for us\".",
            "So what part of the Westinghouse deal is most exciting for Cameco?",
            "\"I'd say all of it is pretty exciting for us. Obviously the fuel business - our fuel businesses are very complementary. We provide fuel, we have the uranium conversion and then we actually provide the fuel for the CANDU reactor fleet here in Canada - Bruce Power, OPG, NB Power. Westinghouse takes over where we don't go. They’re in the light water reactor world and provide fuel there and then of course all the servicing and engineering and outages that they can work on. So that's all exciting stuff, that's their core business really and it's a very durable business. There is some excitement too with some of these new products that they're offering. Obviously the AP1000s that they're out selling. I think for Westinghouse, the e-Vinci,  a smaller unit ... I know here in Saskatchewan the government has been talking about perhaps buying and building one of the e-Vincis ... as Cameco we're looking at fuel for SMRs and whether we can play in that field, the HALEU field. We have the GLE global laser enrichment play in the US that we're moving along and moving along faster than we have because of the need for enrichment and so just a lot of areas for us to focus on now. We think there's a lot of room for growth in the nuclear business across the board, and Cameco wants to be there for that.\"",
            "What has been the impact of the war in Ukraine?",
            "\"Let me start with the impact on our countries, and here in Saskatchewan where our head office is located, I think 15 or 20% of our population here are of Ukrainian heritage, and so it's a really sad state of affairs. And our hearts go out to the people in Ukraine, including our customers at Energoatom. Petro Kotin, President and CEO of Energoatom, is a good friend of mine. We had dinner with him just before the end of last year at a big conference in Paris and then, this happened, so our hearts go out on that side first of all. What has it done for the nuclear industry? It has certainly caused a bit of a bifurcation now in the nuclear industry. Meaning there's those countries and companies that will continue to work with Russia - there are some - but there are a lot that won't anymore, and I think of all the Eastern European countries that have VVER technology in their countries and have relied heavily on the Russians for fuel and servicing and engineering and the things we talked about who are now looking for alternatives, and so we think Westinghouse will have a good opportunity in that market to pick up some business. And then Cameco - I was over there in the spring in the Czech Republic and meeting with some of those countries and so we think some of those will start looking West for alternative fuel supply and we'll be there to provide that, so it's really had a huge impact on the global nuclear industry and on Cameco’s business.\"",
            "What about the global situation for Cameco?",
            "\"We have customers in China and India - two countries that continue to grow, with China on a very fast path of growth and India, the same thing. And you see things changing - South Korea, a complete change - they were looking at phasing out some of their nuclear, now they've included it in their green taxonomy and plan to increase their nuclear presence. I mean, you can go to the UK, you can go to France and you can go to Japan and you can just see the momentum that nuclear is getting both from a clean energy perspective but from an energy security perspective as well. So we think there's great room for growth. I think the IEA came out last week and said if we have about 400 gigawatts today of nuclear, we need to double that. Double that in the next 20-25 years - and so for us that's not a long period of time. We need to get moving and get moving now and we're seeing it with Poland making their announcement, in the US - we're spending lots of time in the US where the Biden administration is very, very positive on nuclear with the Inflation Reduction Act, which has lots of support for nuclear. Here in Canada, our own government, the Ontario government and OPG building the first SMR are well on their way in Canada, the GE Hitachi model and so lots of excitement. Lots of things to do and lots of opportunities around the world.\"",
            "On technological developments in the nuclear energy sector",
            "\"Especially on the small modular reactor front I would say I think that the Canadian regulator has in front of them probably 11 or 12 different models of SMR right now, all competing to be the first out of the gate to get permitted, licenced and start construction and find a home and we need that because those first-of-a-kinds won't be easy. They never are. We've seen it in the larger reactor world and now in the SMR world we need to start building them - the Nth one will be super economic and then probably faster to build. The first one will be tough, and then we need to get the fuel ready for those. And you know, there's your question on Russia and Ukraine. I think we were all relying on many models, relying on the Russians for the HALEU fuel for the first SMRs. Now that door has been slammed shut. And so we're all looking around, scrambling maybe, but looking around for alternative ways we can get HALEU to fire up those first SMRs. So that's going on, but lots of great things going on even with the large fleet - such as accident tolerant fuel and passive safety systems. There's lots going on in nuclear and it's very exciting and very positive.\"",
            "How does the current positive outlook compare with previous optimistic eras?",
            "\"We've seen ebbs and flows before. I remember the period from about 2000 to March 2011. I mean there were too many new reactors to keep track of them. So many uranium companies. I think there were 400 uranium companies around. We got into a real exuberant period of time, probably over-the-top exuberance on nuclear. Everybody was building all the time and then we had Fukushima, so we need to be careful about that because after that we went into a 10 year period that wasn't so positive. But I think we're back again. The world is taking another look at nuclear and saying 'yes we can do it, we can do it safely and and cover for these large energy needs'. I mean, if we're turning to electricity for electric cars and electric everything, we're going to need massive amounts of electricity. And we're good at nuclear, we're very good. We've got a great track record over probably 60 years now and new technologies coming out. And so I'm very optimistic about this period. We need to do it right. We need to get financing for new build. We need to build them as much on time and on budget as we can. We've suffered from that blight a bit in the past, but if we do it right and we can do it right because we've done it in the past, the first one is difficult, but then after that you saw it in Sweden in the 1970s, you saw it in France, you saw it in the US, Canada. We can do it and so now is our opportunity, so we should take advantage of that.\"",
            "Does Brookfields Renewables’ involvement in Westinghouse deal show taxonomy’s importance?",
            "\"I think countries around the world are really recognising the clean energy benefits of nuclear power now and really grabbing on to it - I think there's 70 countries who have now made a net-zero commitment and you know, I think 80% of the energy in the world is fossil fuel fired so we need the path to get there. So you can't throw anything out of the toolbox and I think a lot of countries, as I mentioned earlier, are looking around and saying, what do we have - wind, yes, solar yes. Intermittent and right now they are five or six or maybe 10% of the world production of electricity. We need massive amounts more, and they're looking at nuclear again and saying ‘yeah, we need to keep that as an option’. And so it's very positive for countries looking to hit their net-zero commitments. We're seeing it. We'll see it at COP27 meetings where nuclear is at the table. I can tell you a few COPS ago, we weren't at the table and now we're front and centre at the table of countries looking to build nuclear. So I think nuclear is going to play a huge role in the climate change race to net-zero and decarbonisation electrification. And we as an industry must be ready.\"",
            "On new forms of investors in the nuclear industry",
            "\"We saw it here in Canada last week where the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which has traditionally not gone anywhere near nuclear, committed just under a CAD1 billion to the first SMR - OPG’s SMR. That's a big move. Our Minister of Natural Resources came out with very strong statements last week at the IAEA ministerial, as did many other countries on nuclear. You're seeing taxonomies change that are including nuclear in the clean energy discussion ... it's a complete change of lexicon, a change of thinking, and very positive for industry and now, as I say, we need to deliver.\"",
            "So what are the big challenges to fulfilling the potential?",
            "\"I think we have the technologies, now we've got to start building again. I think on the SMR front we need to get some of those built and up and running so that we can build the Nth one, not the first one. The order books are out there now. I think everyone’s going to be watching very closely in Canada as OPG and GE Hitachi build that first unit. The ground is broken so they're off to the races on that one. And I know in the US there's numerous other ones, we need to get those going. On the big units that are being built - the Chinese are very good at it, the Russians are very good and have a big order book. We in the West now need to show that we're back in the game and that we can take our share of the market. I think the announcement with Poland and Westinghouse was a huge announcement, it's going to be a big project. And I think there are more to come. And so we need to show the world that we can deliver our projects on time, on budget, that nuclear is going to be a critical part of the clean energy infrastructure going forward, and we on the fuel side have to be there to back it up with the fuel to run these things. And that’s not for a year or five years or even 10 years - for 50 years. When you're building a reactor today, you're worried about uranium in 2060 and 2080 and so that's what we're thinking about now. It's not just the next few years, it's decades.”",

            "The key quotes from the Great British Nuclear (GBN) chairman's",
            "podcast interview covering future nuclear energy capacity in the UK.",
            "The six contenders in the small modular reactor contest (Image: Composite of each firm's visuals)",
            "The interview with GBN chairman Simon Bowen took place shortly after the UK government unveiled a roadmap to achieving 24GW of nuclear capacity by 2050, and as the six shortlisted companies (EDF, GE Hitachi, Holtec, NuScale, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse) await the next stage of the GBN-led selection process for the UK's small modular reactor programme. Here is an edited selection of key quotes:",
            "How significant is the UK government's roadmap for GBN?",
            "I think it's an overwhelmingly positive document, the next stage in the creation of the nuclear programme for the UK. It gives GBN three roles - it talks about GBN running the SMR selection process. It then talks about us taking on broader nuclear delivery, which means that if we do another gigawatt unit it is likely we'll run the selection process and then run the project and also, when advanced modular reactors (AMRs) come to fruition, it is highly likely that we would run that as well. The third role, which is really important, is that we advise government on the development of policy.",
            "What about the Roadmap more generally?",
            "The important thing is the reiteration of the target of up to 24GW with three to seven gigawatts every five years between 2030 and 2044, which I think is very important because it signals the range that we're aiming at. And then the reiteration that we are going to explore another gigawatt reactor after Sizewell, which for me is very, very important, because there is no way that we're going to get to 2050 and 24GW without the whole range and scales of reactors. Some big announcements on HALEU ... it also talks about the importance of regulation and skills and supply chains. Some people may say there's not a huge amount new in there - well there is, and there is the commitment of government to go on and deliver the programme. And it starts to spell out what the heart of that might be. It's a great step forward and a step in the right direction for forming the UK's new nuclear programme, which we will be accountable for delivering alongside our colleagues in Sizewell and Hinkley.",
            "The short-term focus of SMRs on the eight sites declared in the existing national policy statement is an important set of criteria that we are applying, but I think everybody recognises that if you're going to go after 24GW then those sites are simply not going to be enough, because we live on a small island and and we've got to have much more flexibility about the sites that we have access to. We have to allow the market to have access to the sites we are no longer looking at, or, the consultation is suggesting, that we should no longer be looking at the designation of sites, we should be looking at a criteria-based model which allows the developers to identify the sites and the usages they think they need, and then the criteria that they think should be applied, which should give an awful lot more flexibility to the market to deliver market-led projects. The second part is all about how you enable all of that and the whole role of planning, of environmental consenting, smarter regulation and the documentation - there's some really important consultation on those elements because if we don't get those more efficient, we will not be able to deliver on the target of 24GW. So a combination of more sites, simpler processes and more enabling regulation are really, really important.",
            "On prospects of new sites for nuclear in the UK",
            "We are looking at acquiring access to the existing sites for the SMR programme, sites like Oldbury, Wylfa, Heysham, Hartlepool and the others within the existing policy statement. Those are recognised nuclear sites which we can build on at scale - the SMR programme is all about scale and getting as quickly as we can to deliver on energy security and on the journey to net-zero. The views of the wider nuclear population are really important though, because when you look at AMRs, then if you get things like passive safety approved - walk-away safe - on a number of the AMR technologies, the sites that gives you access to is so much broader. And therefore things like the old industrial sites become more readily accessible because they will very likely be in a different regulatory regime, or modified regulatory regime, because the planning zones are going to be so much smaller. So a more flexible approach to allow the private sector to identify these sites where they know they've got the demand that will justify their business case, and a combination of that plus an enhanced regulatory regime, or a modified regulatory regime, for the different types of plants, all of that will start to open up more sites and therefore more output.",
            "Will GBN be involved in the private-sector led initiatives?",
            "When we did the scoping work for GBN, the very clear advice from all of the nuclear systems around the UK, around the world, was that you really do need a government programme, a government-led programme, an underwritten programme to rejuvenate the nuclear industry and get it started again. And that's exactly why GBN has been set up. What that doesn't do for one minute is preclude private developers developing their own projects, and we would want to encourage it. The only reason we haven't done that so far, is just bandwidth. Let's get set up on the journey to energy security and net-zero through the SMR programme, and now we're in a place where we want to really understand when developers tell us that they don't need any support from government, they don't need any money from the government, well tell us more about that, because we really want to understand it. Having market-led projects will absolutely allow the government to fulfill one of its aims, which is to get as much of this off the government balance sheet and out of the public finances as possible. So the sooner we can do that the better and therefore alternative routes to market and market-led projects are one of the major routes through which you'll deliver that. Our level of support would depend on the level of support they suggest - in the short term I think it is highly likely that we would be, as a very minimum, providing a supporting role.",
            "On the current state of the SMR contest",
            "I prefer to refer to it as a selection process because although they might be competing, we're selecting what we need. The first thing to say is that we're delighted that we got six highly credible technologies that have come forward and want to be part of our process, which is great. We are at the final stages now (11 January, 2024) of preparing and getting the approvals for the invitation to submit an initial tender document. This is the next stage where all six companies will engage with our contractual documentation in terms of how we think it should be structured. They'll submit the responses in their initial tender, we will then go through a process to down-select to around about four with the aim to be placing contracts later in the year. That process is ongoing, I think the main thing that we are very focused on is absolutely on pace, because we need to move quickly from an energy security point of view and from an international market point of view, but what I'm not prepared to do from the GBN board perspective, is trade pace for rigour. Because rigour in the procurement process can be very, very important. So we are in continual conversations at a board level to say, ‘right, ok, are we really ready to go, do we really have a good understanding of the documents, how they fit together’ because at a point where that's the case then we'll release them. I'm delighted about where we've got to, we've got a great team of people ... we’ve got the right people around the table in terms of the vendors and we have got a mass of stuff to do this year because once we've got the tenders out, we've then got to start pulling together what the development companies might look like.",
            "The tender is for the technology all the way through to completion of the regulatory process and final design and completion of design, with then the potential to place a contract. We need an entity that is going to develop the site, a development company, and because we're looking at hopefully more than one technology that we'll be developing, we will be highly likely to be having to pull together more than one development company who will characterise the site, apply for the the consent and the environmental permit, and the nuclear site licence, and then manage the construction and move into operation - and the scale of those is probably about the size of a FTSE 100 company, each one. So these are massive undertakings and we've got all of that to do. It is a hugely exciting time, but actually pretty daunting as well at the same time.",
            "How many of the contenders are likely to be selected?",
            "The initial down-select will be from six to around about four, depending on how things go, and then the documentation says between one and four will be awarded a contract. I think the optimum number is somewhere between two and three, but we will be retaining our optionality and there are some important conversations for us to have with government and the Treasury to determine what, in the policy space, they they are prepared to support.",
            "Will each one chosen be tied to a specific site",
            "At the point where we place the contracts, we will have identified and acquired access to the site. And we will match sites to technology and those sites will have the scale to be able to build multiple SMRs of that technology at that site. So the likelihood is it will be one, two or three in the first stage but then being very clear that if these are successful, as we hope they will be, and they can demonstrate that their costs are going to come down with the second, third and fourth units, and we can convince ourselves it's value for money, then we want to just continue building on those sites. As we've learned internationally, that is the right thing to do ... again subject to the final stages approval, our current view is that we will be placing contracts for more than one (reactor) because what we have to demonstrate is that modularisation works and therefore the investment that is required to build the modular factories.",
            "Will Wylfa be available for SMRs?",
            "I think there is a quite a big policy decision for us to make, which has not been yet made, which is, with the announcement that we are going to explore building another gigawatt scale plant after Sizewell, we've got to be clear about whether we are going to look to identify another site for that, or whether that site should be Wylfa. So there is a debate about whether Wylfa is used for SMRs or gigawatt. Therefore that will drive when we look to acquire access to it.",
            "Is Final Investment Decision still targeted for 2029?",
            "Yes, at the latest 2029. If we could do it before that, then, of course we will.",
            "There's an election coming in the UK, will politics derail plans?",
            "I am very confident that the UK political parties are committed to nuclear being a critical part of baseload power, because every nation that has nuclear capabilities worldwide thinks the same. And the COP28 declaration where 20+ countries have said we’ll triple nuclear by 2050 is massively important for us, so from a macro sense, I think we are in great shape. We've never been in better shape for nuclear, cross-party, I don't think that we will skip a beat in intent. Of course, when there is a change of party, then there is bound to be a little bit of a hiatus as the new team get their feet under the desk and determine how they want to apply their fiscal priorities. Therefore I think the risk is more of scale and pace than whether we do or don't have a nuclear programme. If I was asked to bet money on it I would say that we'll continue with the scale and the pace that we've set out so far, because actually there is no alternative.",
            "General global outlook for nuclear",
            "I think it mirrors what I've just said about the UK - that COP28 declaration was a very important moment in the international nuclear industry and it is one industry, you know, this is not a  national industry where you can draw boundaries. Everything we do is international. Now what does that mean? Well, it's a good news/bad news story.The brilliant news is that we will, as an industry, have the opportunity to grow multiple technologies at multiple scales. And all learn from each other. Having moved out of the nuclear industry and come back into it, the thing I love about the industry is everybody wants to learn from everybody else. I've never seen an industry where people have the thirst for learning off each other and are prepared to share. It is almost unique in that sense, so the opportunity to learn and therefore all accelerate and therefore all contribute to combating climate change and net-zero is just hugely compelling and a great opportunity. So on one hand, I'm just very, very proud to be part of that because I think it's got huge potential. The bad side is there's a global demand for capability. And everywhere you look, we all want very similar skills, so although, the nuclear specialist skills are somewhere between 10 and 20% of what we need, the 70/80/90% of the skills we need are skills that can be employed in infrastructure, in carbon capture usage and storage, hydrogen and petrochem. It is a massive market that we're competing with and it’s a global market. So that's the challenge. It is hugely compelling and with massive opportunities, we have really got to get our act together in terms of skills and capability to understand how we're going to deliver on our ambitions globally, and critically, nationally.",
            "What industry can do to help with nuclear's expansion plans",
            "I think the first thing is we've got to act as one industry - unless we share skills and we find mechanisms for sharing skills across the nuclear sector, both in defence and civil and across the boundaries then it's going to be very, very difficult to succeed. I think the other thing is that the private sector, and I can say this because I'm still part of it, we have got as many signals as we need now to invest. We've got to get on with raising the cash to invest in the infrastructure and the skills and the capability that are required. So waiting for a starting gun any longer isn't going to work. That starting gun's been fired. And these announcements are part of that, so, I think we've all just got to trust in the fact that absolutely, this is going to happen, it's got to happen, and we need to be prepared with the right capability and the right capacity ... it's now up to us to deliver.",

It anticipates creating up to 40,000 high-value British jobs and intellectual property, and opening up a £400 billion export market.",
            "John Molyneaux, director of engineering and technology for civil nuclear at Rolls-Royce, outlined the SMR sector to the workshop's delegates. \"The challenge here is to think beyond what you see in the normal literature. It's that innovation, that spark that all the finalists can bring that's really important, because when you've been in the industry for 30 years, as I have, you tend to think in a conforming way with the industry around you. So, thinking in an innovative way is critical because we can't move forward without it.\"",
            "SMR is a \"very broad church\", he said, with a number of designs around the world. \"You can't lose track of the fact that anyone developing an SMR, probably wants to dominate their home market and could quite easily be supported by their own government. That means when we talk about the overall international marketplace we need to think about accessibility. There is no chance that any individual nation will have a market sufficient to warrant the development and then deployment of multiple sites to the extent of getting a good return on the investment,\" he said.",
            "Referring to the light water, high-temperature gas-cooled and liquid metal SMR designs, he said: \"At the outset, I would encourage you to think hard about the origins of plant designs in submitting your papers because that often tells the fundamental advantages and drivers which led to the initial part of the design.\" He added: \"And the time to market for the SMR technology is really important.\"",

            "Morris added: \"Both France and the UK have their own strengths, technologically and culturally speaking, as we've seen with the Hinkley Point C project. Britain hasn't built a reactor in close to 30 years and therefore we have France to help bring their knowledge of the continuing use, construction and design of nuclear reactors in the last years, particularly with regards to Flamanville, to bring that through into the UK as part of a French design context. But, similarly, the ONR and British nuclear history and expertise are also something that's invaluable and it's a benchmark that feeds back through to France.\"",

It's about making decisions about what it is you want to get out of the opportunity. So, if it's speed to market, that helps with your decision-making on what technology to zone in on, and once you've done that you can align and drive forward. Equally, if it's more of the future innovative skills development approach that you want, then you will be interested in a different technology set.

            "The challenges the nuclear industry faces are largely external and must be overcome if it is to help tackle the existential threat of climate change, panellists in the",
            "Nuclear Energy and its Future",
            "conference on 11 January said. These challenges include: the notion nuclear is an out-dated technology; the cost of finance; market design; political changes; perceived competition with renewable energy; and the public's misconceptions about radioactive waste.",
            "\"Whether you look at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and their famous 1.5 degree report, or you look at the International Energy Agency and their scenarios, if you want to have a prayer to get anywhere close to the Paris climate targets of constraining the temperature rise to 2 degrees Centigrade over pre-industrial levels, then you need probably to at least double the contribution of nuclear,\" said Dan Poneman, president and CEO of Centrus Energy Corp.",
            "\"And if you think, as in the IPCC report, that 2 degrees is not enough, and if you want to get to 1.5 degrees, then the case [for nuclear] is that much stronger. And, to be clear, that assumes absolutely maximum deployment of solar and wind and battery storage. You just don’t close the gap without a lot of new nuclear.\"",
            "The idea that nuclear energy is on the way out is erroneous, said Sama Bilbao y León, director general of World Nuclear Association.",
            "Nuclear power is the second largest source of low-carbon electricity in the world and the first among OECD countries. At the end of 2020, there were 441 operable reactors in 31 nations, more than 50 new reactors under construction (including seven new construction starts), and five new units came online in Belarus, China, Russia and the UAE. Notably, Belarus, Turkey and the UAE are newcomers to nuclear energy. About 600 MWe of nuclear capacity will be added this year and, in the US alone, almost 200 MWe of nuclear capacity has been added to the grid because of uprates, meaning improvements to the way existing nuclear plants operate. The 15 new reactors that are coming online this year include new technologies - a fast neutron reactor and a small modular reactor, both in China.",
            "\"There are a few countries, including Germany, Belgium and Spain, that are contemplating the permanent shutdown of their existing fleet but on the other hand we have a very large number of countries, not only in Europe but all over the world, that are actually trying to expand [nuclear], for example, eastern European countries, and some of them for the first time, such as Poland. Also, the UK, France, Finland and the Netherlands are putting a strong focus on continuing nuclear,\" Bilbao y León said.",
            "Jay Wileman, president and CEO of GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, said the future of nuclear really depends on \"building on today's nuclear\", the operating fleets that are generating 11% of the world's electricity, and nearly 20% of all the electricity and almost 60% of the clean energy in the USA.",
            "\"By keeping them operating and working with our customers is really critical. We learned a lot last year from COVID. My business was thinking about how our factory workers do the PPE [personal protective equipment] checks, as other businesses are doing, but also about enabling our engineers to collaborate whilst working from their offices, their dining rooms, wherever, and keeping them safe. The third area I think about is supporting our customers with outages; how do we work with them to have their protocols in place and be safe for our teams as they're engaging in a 2-3 week outage. It's a new way of working that we're getting used to and we just have to figure out how to keep supporting our customers so they can keep that 24/7 reliable carbon-free nuclear plant running.\"",
            "GE Hitachi is also part of the new wave of small modular reactors, with its BWRX-300 design. Asked whether such technologies are going to replace large-scale nuclear plants, Wileman said: \"If you're going to be net zero, nuclear is going to have a place, but you're not guaranteed a seat at the table unless you can be cost competitive with other forms of generation. It's great to be small and modular, but you still have to compete with those others as well, so I think about it with my team as a series of 'What ifs?'",
            "\"These are: What if you could have an SMR that is cost competitive with combined cycle gas, solar and wind? What if the total cost of that plant isn't double-digit billions like some of the large builds are, but is actually a billion or under? What if you can simplify a reactor to get the cost down? What if you can use the existing supply chain? What if you can have SMRs address other things, like process heat, hydrogen generation, district heating, that really increase the value of that asset? What if you can get that out to the grid by 2028?\"",
            "Poneman said there are Generation III and Generation III+ units under construction, including the Vogtle plant in the USA, but noted the attention SMRs are attracting.",
            "\"There are both conventional lightwater reactors of the small variety, like GE's design, and there are also fourth generation reactors that don’t use water coolants; they use gas, liquid metal or sodium, etc. All of these have a tremendous amount of excitement and in the United States the government is investing heavily and is now watching what's called the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, in which they have already funded two of these advanced designs for a 50-50 cost share to be deployed and have given a number of additional grants to other reactors to be developed,\" he said.",
            "\"We need to do two things - get the costs down and have regulatory reform. But we have to get smarter, better, faster, cheaper manufacturing methods, artificial intelligence designs etc. The other thing is we have to restore public confidence in places like Germany, Belgium and Japan where you still have aftershocks, politically speaking, with respect to Fukushima. I think the way to regain public confidence is to show that we have faster, better, cheaper designs that can bring tremendous amounts of clean energy, and without which we are going to face continued rising sea levels and lost polar ice caps and devastated coral reefs etc.",
            "\"It would be remiss if I did not say one thing more, which is all of these great designs won’t do very much if we don’t have fuel for them and so we in our company are focused very much on developing this new form of highly concentrated fuel from high-assay, low-enriched uranium. A problem that the vast number of developers in the United States have said keeps them awake at night is access to this new type of fuel. So if we can get all of these things working, then it's very promising for all of us and for the planet.\"",
            "Bilbao y León said that approaches to regulation need to be harmonised and markets need to reflect the true value of nuclear energy as low-carbon baseload power.",
            "\"There is a need for a level playing field in all aspects, including at the policy and the market levels. We need a new paradigm that really focuses on genuine public wellbeing, our health, the environmental impacts and the socio-economic impacts of all energy sources, and truly looks at them in the same context to make a fair comparison. When that is done, it will be much easier to see how nuclear can positively contribute to the economy and the decarbonistion of electricity systems,\" she said.",
            "\"Current energy markets fail to recognise the full cost and the full benefits of all the sources of electricity generation. Even if we have carbon pricing, it doesn't really include all climate change costs or pollution costs. No system [currently] takes into account the value of system costs, or the value of the reliability or 24/7 operation, such as are provided by nuclear energy. Another thing that will have a huge impact when developing new nuclear is having access to financing that is also equitable with other low-carbon electricity sources.",
            "\"Another necessary aspect is the harmonisation of regulatory processes. There is a need for more international consistency, efficiency and predictability in the way that new reactors are licensed.\"",
            "George Borovas, head of nuclear at Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, said the approaches to financing clean energy projects are growing.",
            "\"Over the past few years we've seen solutions coming up around the world. A lot of countries are looking at new nuclear, finding financial solutions and employing different models, from using export credit agencies as well as sovereign finance models, so there is a better understanding of the risks that go along with the construction of new nuclear,\" he said.",
            "\"We have different technologies now. The Gen III reactors that were designed and built over the past 20 years are now operating. And something the nuclear industry has shown is that, once you have a nuclear reactor, the costs go down, the standardisation increases, and so you can replicate what you've done before and with success. Now we also have small modular reactors that are slowly being developed and which are promising to be cheaper, safer, better, and that's going to provide more discreet financial solutions for [units] that are going to be built in series.",
            "\"In general over the past few years, I've seen tremendous excitement return to the nuclear industry, and it reminds me of the technological revolution that we saw in the 1980s in other technologies. Nuclear is going to play a vital role in the development of safe and reliable power for the future of the world.\"",
            "The falling cost of solar and wind power is often interpreted as a threat to nuclear, which is a false connection, the panellists said.",
            "\"This is not an either/or. We have a huge challenge ahead of us and if we want to achieve decarbonisation and at the same time the Sustainable Development Goals, we are going to need everything. There is also the typical understanding that nuclear has always been expensive, or the economics of nuclear are not as good as they need to be,\" Bilbao y León said.",
            "She noted that a joint report by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Energy Agency, published in December, states that the lowest cost energy sources of all types is the lifetime extension of nuclear plants. \"The cheapest way, hands-down, to ensure low-carbon generation for the next 20 years is lifetime extension of the current nuclear power plants,\" she said.",
            "Another conclusion of the report was that new nuclear projects for the next five years are actually competitive with all other forms of electricity generation, including wind and solar.",
            "\"What we are seeing is that the nuclear industry has actually achieved a lot of learning from recent projects that have not been as on budget and schedule as we would have liked them to be, but the expectation is that future projects are going to become much more competitive,\" Bilbao y León said.",
            "She stressed that 70% of the levelised cost of nuclear is the cost of finance. \"This means that if nuclear can have access to competitive financial resources comparable with those that other energy sources do, then the cost will come down even more. That's why it's important to have a level playing field that looks at all energy sources in the same way, and that establishes criteria that are technology neutral and that are based on the actual accomplishments of the technology,\" she said. \"I truly think that new nuclear projects are going to become much more competitive than they are. Small modular reactors are going to make nuclear much more affordable and that means nuclear will expand to markets which perhaps haven't considered having nuclear before.\"",
            "Poneman said renewables need to be understood not only in terms of their benefits but also their limitations.",
            "\"On the connection between renewables and nuclear, we need all of it, but if you want to max out intermittent sources, then you need to back it up. The battery technology is not cheap enough or widespread enough at grid-scale to be able to do that job. So, if you want to maximise solar, you need dispatchable power that's either coal, gas or nuclear, and obviously nuclear is the carbon-free version of that,\" he said.",
            "Taming the Sun, Innovations to Harness Solar Energy and Power the Planet",
            ", by Varun Sivaram, Poneman said, \"It's faster, better, cheaper to do that if you have the backup of dispatchable power, of which nuclear is a good case in point.\"",
            "He noted the Natrium concept launched by GE Hitachi and Bill Gates' TerraPower, which features a sodium fast reactor combined with a molten salt energy storage system that will allow over five hours of energy storage.",
            "\"They use the heat all the time generated by the nuclear reaction to heat molten salt, so that molten salt can serve the same way as a battery to backstop the additional use of solar power. So, the either/or proposition between nuclear and solar and wind is a false dichotomy and it's destructive to our overall energy and climate goals,\" Poneman said.",
            "Borovas said nuclear is the natural clean energy partner for renewables.",
            "\"Nuclear and renewables complement each other because nuclear is the baseload energy that helps you run your industry and makes sure that the lights are on at all times, and then, with renewables, you can have a combination of low-carbon sources. What we've seen happen in some countries is that renewables have been displacing nuclear, which doesn’t make sense,\" he said.",
            "\"Having renewables backed up with gas-fired plants or sometimes even coal-fired plants doesn’t make sense if climate change is your number one priority, and I think there is universal consensus that that is our number one priority. Having nuclear and renewables together working at full capacity is the only solution that we have for climate change today.\"",
            "Bilbao y León also addressed the false claim that nuclear units are inflexible.",
            "\"Although it is true that nuclear reactors don’t like to be turned on and off, they are much more flexible than is commonly known. We have many countries, including France, Germany and the US, where nuclear reactors actually do follow the load,\" she said.",
            "\"Moving forward towards Generation IV reactors, their flexibility and ability to load follow are going to be even more possible. And don’t forget that nuclear energy is the only low-carbon energy source that can produce electricity and heat at the same time, which will be very important to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors, such as transportation and industry.\"",
            "Asked how political changes, such as the new US administration, are affecting the nuclear industry, Borovas said: \"In the United States over the past few years we've seen an increased competitiveness in attention to the US nuclear industry and its exports. What we've seen from the new Biden administration is there's going to be a continuation of that policy.\"",
            "There is consensus among lawmakers in the USA that nuclear energy is a geopolitical matter and that there is competition from Russia and China. This means there is an understanding that the US nuclear industry and its exports are going to be vital for that country's national security and commercial interests, he said.",
            "\"You can't be an exporter of technology without first taking care of your domestic industry, so the United States needs to keep its existing fleet, start building new nuclear power plants and then the world market will listen and say it's going to buy its product. If you say, 'We're not going to be building it back home because we have cheap gas, but buy my product because it's a great one', then that's not going to be very convincing. Slowly the United States is beginning to understand that,\" he said.",
            "Wileman said he had felt \"very encouraged\" over the last few years by the bipartisan and bicameral support in the USA for the nuclear industry.",
            "\"You see the number of bills that have come out, including the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, because of which the Natrium project was able to move forward. That's a great way to accelerate technology coming to market,\" he said. \"I think we do have the incoming administration's support; it's in their platform, and obviously climate is key. In the US, we're going to continue to seek momentum. It will be all about getting online, getting traction and getting those reactors under way.\"",
            "Poneman picked up on Borovas' comment that a nuclear industry \"needs to be strong at home to be strong internationally\".",
            "He said: \"Let's not forget non-proliferation because the United States was at the cornerstone with President Eisenhower and ever since in setting up a whole global network of non-proliferation controls and restrictions that have made nuclear power safe, not only in terms of physical safety, but in terms of national security safety. So, the United States has to get out there. Obviously China and Russia have been very aggressive in promoting nuclear exports, and if the United States wants to continue to be a global leader, in terms of both safety standards and non-proliferation standards, then this commitment is present in the new administration. It was in the climate plan published by then candidate and vice-president, and now president-elect, Biden, who has advocated for advanced nuclear.\"",
            "This represents a great opportunity for the USA \"to get our groove back\", he said. \"The fact that we have strong bicameral support - both the House and the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, the Congress and the White House - is a very auspicious circumstance for the future.\"",
            "The long-term management of used nuclear fuel and nuclear waste is an issue often raised by sceptics of nuclear energy but, the fact is, the nuclear industry \"has done a fabulous job throughout its entire history\", to the point that it is well know where this material is, and how it is being managed, isolated and separated from the environment and from humans, Bilbao y León said. Notably there has been work on deep geological disposal and on recycling fuel in reactors.",
            "\"Obviously the choice of policies for managing used fuel and nuclear waste rests with individual countries but the technologies for this do exist,\" she said. \"In Finland, a deep geological repository is under construction and will start operations in a couple of years, and so we will have a functioning example of how this can be done. The long-term management of used fuel and nuclear waste is one of those issues that is important for the energy community to look at the entire picture, and in fact we will see how nuclear waste is really not a big problem and is being well-managed by the industry.\"",
            "Wileman added: \"Always, when I'm on a panel, I hear the term nuclear 'waste' and I'm glad Sama corrected it; she said 'used' nuclear fuel. I would go a little further and call it 'slightly used' nuclear fuel because, of the typical fuel that we have today, we've only extracted a few percent of its potential energy. So, I have always been a proponent of closing the fuel cycle and really getting all the energy out of there. The Gen IV fast reactors are well-suited for that, so as we move through the different generations of design, I think we'll have the opportunity to elegantly address that topic.\"",
            "Poneman said the management of nuclear waste is \"a much bigger political problem than it is a physical problem\".",
            "\"All of the nuclear waste generated in the United States of America since the beginning of the nuclear era would fill one football field seven yards deep. Closing the fuel cycle is one way, but we know for a fact the scientifically geologic storage formations that work. What we need is to have the same as they have in Finland, which is a consent-based process, so that the public will have confidence in the solution that is found. With the options we've described - both geologic long-term disposal and recycling - the solutions are well in-hand,\" he said.",
            "Asked what they would say to those who oppose nuclear energy, regardless of the facts, Wileman said: \"If you care about the environment and if you have questions, learn, go and be inquisitive, find the truth rather than what's in a headline. Look at what nuclear energy has been doing and what it can do in the future. Educating, which the World Nuclear Association works on, and the Nuclear Energy Institute in the US, is a key part that we have to keep in mind as we go forward and bring people on board supporting nuclear.\"",
            "Poneman added: \"By 2050, if we don't max out on getting to net zero, we will lose 99% of the world's coral reefs, all of the polar ice caps, and God knows what's going to happen to the coastal areas of most of the world, and you will have devastation of a catastrophic planetary dimension. Nuclear power is safe. In terms of deaths per watt generated, it is among the safest in the world. If you care about saving the planet, let's get nuclear right; let's not throw it out the window.\"",
            "Bilbao y León repeated that the choice to use nuclear energy must remain a decision for every individual country, but it would be \"irresponsible\" to deprive future generations of that choice. \"We can't close the door to this technology just because we have the opinions we have right now.\"",
            "Borovas said: \"The key to sustainable development is energy and electricity. As we try to get people all over the world out of poverty and into the middle class, then having abundant and clean electricity that does not affect the environment is key. Nuclear has to be part of that.\"",

            "New nuclear programs similarly need to align with associated infrastructure, such as grid and transport networks, as well as develop a supply chain, receive planning consents and engage with national and local government, along with the businesses, education establishments and communities in the area the project is based. They also need to have their reactor design scrutinised by national regulators, a process that in the UK can take as long as five years. In addition, the project needs to have a fuel supply, operations, maintenance and decommissioning strategy, looking as much as 80 years ahead.",
            "Representatives of the three planned UK projects - led by EDF Energy, Horizon Nuclear Power and NuGeneration - told Marketforce's",
            "on 20 April that, although they are each taking a different approach to finance, they all have the same focus - to demonstrate their plans are \"investible\". Other infrastructure experts, from AECOM, National Grid and Crossrail, offered additional insight.",
            "From left to right, Evans, Devlin, Knee and Brister at the Marketforce event (Image: WNN)",
            "The three projects are not competing to justify the benefits they bring to the UK electricity sector - since the start of the decade 26 of the country's power stations have closed and together they accounted for around 20% of its electricity generation capacity. By the end of 2030, a further 35% of that capacity is likely to have gone. The need therefore for new and reliable low-carbon power is even more important than ever here in the UK, delegates at the conference heard. Where the new build consortia",
            "competing, potentially, is for additional investors to carry their respective projects beyond a final investment decision (FID).",
            "\"It takes millions to establish one of these programs and billions to deliver them,\" said Jay Brister, vice president of business development at AECOM, a US-based construction, engineering and professional services firm. \"Delivery of a new nuclear project involves a complex set of high risk, high impact activities over ten to 15 years with huge financial implications. Risk and risk mitigation is a key component of financing, whether it's political, geographical or completion risk. Coming up with the right financing structure is one of the biggest challenges that you face in one of these programs.\"",
            "Brister added that implementing a successful nuclear power program requires the positive support of international and bilateral agreements; a stable, independent and reliable nuclear regulator; technical skills and infrastructure development; a proven delivery program and partners; positive electricity market regulation; a decommissioning strategy; as well as fuel cycle and back end management. Above all, the role of government is the key to success, he said.",
            "EDF Energy has state backing for its Hinkley Point C (HPC) project in Somerset - the majority owner of its parent company, EDF Group, is the French government, and its Chinese partner is state-owned.",
            "Consisting of two European Pressurised Reactors (EPRs), HPC will be the first new nuclear power station to be built in the UK in almost 20 years and will provide about 7% of the country's electricity.",
            "Under a deal agreed last October, China General Nuclear (CGN) will take a 33.5% stake in EDF Energy's £18 billion ($28 billion) project to construct HPC. In addition, the two companies will develop projects to build new plants at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex, the latter using Chinese reactor technology. EDF's share in the project stands at 66.5%, but the company said it intends to offer other investors stakes in the project whilst retaining at least a 50% share itself.",
            "Humphrey Cadoux-Hudson, managing director of nuclear new build at EDF Energy, told delegates: \"We now have the right framework in place, developed and delivered under a sequence of governments to make this investment possible. That's why EDF Group and our Chinese partner CGN, together with the UK and French governments, are absolutely committed to this project going ahead.\"",
            "Since 2012 EDF Energy has received its nuclear site licence and generic design assessment (GDA) for the UK EPR design, as well as planning permission from the Secretary of State, following a year-long examination by the Planning Inspectorate. In 2013, it reached agreement with the UK government on the key terms of the proposed contract-for-difference (CfD) and with Infrastructure UK it guaranteed the project debt. A year later, following examination by the European Commission, it received state aid approval for these agreements, which include the price, contract length, inflation indexation and fiscal risk protection.",
            "EDF Energy has so far spent £2.4 billion on the project, but has yet to make a FID, which had been expected by the end of last year. The group's chairman and CEO, Jean-Bernard Lévy, said in March that EDF is negotiating with the French government to obtain further financial support for HPC.",
            "Cadoux-Hudson told the conference: \"Investment of this scale - £18 billion through construction to operation of Hinkley Point C - clearly needs to be made with careful thought.\" Difficult wholesale power market conditions, plus the wide range of investments that EDF is looking to make to deliver low-carbon power for its customers, mean a FID on Hinkley requires time, he said. But the company is confident, he said, that a FID will be taken soon and that plans for commissioning of the first reactor in 2025 will go ahead.",
            "Referring to schedule and cost overruns of the EPRs under construction at Olkiluoto and Flamanville, Cadoux-Hudson said, \"The challenges of the EPR design in Finland and France relate to the need to put in place the highest standards of project management, to integrate the supply chain into the design process and to ensure that we will only start in earnest when we are sure that we won't have to stop. It's an easy thing to say but requires an enormous amount of planning.\"",
            "EDF is \"seeing great progress\" at the two EPRs under construction by CGN in Taishan in China, where testing is already under way on the primary circuit, with the first unit expected to be in operation next year. \"The experience of construction in Taishan has helped us to prepare even better for construction at Hinkley,\" he said. \"Above all the need for an integrated robust schedule and cost estimates and a stable design from the start are essential.\"",
            "EDF Energy has spent more than 4.7 million hours on engineering to finalise the reference design for the UK EPR, and it is working through construction via 4-D digital models of the plant covering the site layout, through the arrangements of the internals of the building, down to the detail of individual reinforcement bars, he said. Major preparation work on the site itself has been completed.",
            "Nigel Knee, EDF Energy's head of nuclear policy, said that HPC is \"already an investible project\". He told",
            ": \"How have we got there? It's about having political support, regulatory and political stability. Then, when you look at the individual parts of the project, it's about being able to present to potential investors and to say that you have correctly identified the risks and allocated them to the parties that are best able to take them. We're prepared to take on the construction risk. For revenue risk we needed some support from the government in order to secure the contract-for-difference to provide a measure of revenue certainty over a 35-year period. Then you put together the business case which leads to a competition in the world market for capital. You need to be able to demonstrate that investing in the project will bring a competitive rate of return.\" The CfD for the Hinkley project \"is not a guaranteed income stream\", he stressed. “We still need to sell all the power in the market. We may well be paying back if fossil fuel prices are very low.\"",
            "Tried and tested technology",
            "Carl Devlin, program director at Horizon Nuclear Power, said bringing a technology that is tried and tested is a \"fundamental part of our proposition\". The advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR) has been built and operated four times in Japan, he said, and \"sitting behind that is a long legacy of nuclear power projects inside Hitachi\". Horizon is \"working to ensure the transfer of expertise from Japan into the UK to support our schedule as well as delivering it on cost,\" he said.",
            "Established in 2009 and acquired by Hitachi in November 2012, Horizon aims to provide at least 5.4 GWe of new capacity across two sites by deploying Hitachi-GE UK ABWRs. It expects the first unit at Wylfa to be operating in the first half of the 2020s. The project represents a £20 billion investment in the UK energy sector.",
            "The project is to be carried out as a single engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract joint venture. \"We will be bringing on a management partner and a project delivery partner,\" Devlin said. \"Our number one priority is to make this an investible project.\"",
            "Devlin, who joined Horizon last year, has worked on industrial projects in other sectors, including Heathrow's Terminal 5 and the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. For such large-scale projects to be a successful investment, he said, \"you have to make sure all the components are clear and ready before you start. Changes are expensive and that's when you get into cost overruns.\"",
            "He added: \"It's crucial that we create and develop a project that is investible and get the commercial and financial arrangements right to ensure it attracts the additional investment that will be required. We look forward to making real and demonstrable progress in our discussions with Her Majesty's Government so that we can complete on track with the current schedule.\" The project will require a CfD, a \"Treasury guarantee\", future power sales and additional investors, he said.",
            "Completing the GDA process and obtaining all the planning and environmental consents and permits that are required are \"fundamental enablers for giving confidence to investors that we are able to achieve the project\", he said. Horizon is working towards making its site licence application and it has a number of work streams on site, he added. The company expects to have all consents and permits required for the project by mid-2018 and to make a FID in early 2019.",
            "Recent progress with the project includes the second round of public consultation in North Wales; opening a new Gloucester headquarters and expanding its Anglesey site office; launching graduate and apprenticeship schemes; appointing Lloyds Register as independent third party inspection agents; and establishing Hitachi Nuclear Energy Europe.",
            "Like Horizon, NuGen will deliver its project by securing finance from \"internal and external sources\". That means working with its shareholders and relevant governmental finance sources to get to a FID and delivering debt and equity into the structure. They aim to deliver their project within the existing policy framework which provides a CfD and access to UK government guarantees.",
            "A joint venture between Toshiba and Engie, NuGen plans to build a nuclear power plant of up to 3.8 GWe gross capacity at Moorside in West Cumbria. NuGen says it combines the strengths of its two globally-recognised parent companies, with proven operating and engineering experience, and AP1000 nuclear reactor technology provided by Westinghouse Electric Company, a group company of Toshiba.",
            "Alastair Evans, head of government affairs at NuGen, told",
            ", \"NuGen is confident of timescale deliveries. Westinghouse is delivering AP1000s in China and the US and this gives certainty to the market what we are aiming to deliver at our Moorside project.\"",
            "Sanmen 1 in China's Zhejiang province is expected to be the first Westinghouse AP1000 to begin operating. Four AP1000 reactors are being built in the USA - two each at Vogtle and Summer - while three AP1000s are also proposed for the Moorside site.",
            "reported in March that the integrated head package had been installed on top of the reactor pressure vessel of Sanmen 1 and that the unit is expected to start operations in September.",
            "Both Toshiba and Engie have said they are fully committed to the project all the way up to FID, Evans said, which NuGen expects to make by the end of 2018.",
            "Managed by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the Environment Agency, the GDA process has its origins in the UK government's White Paper on Nuclear Power of January 2008.",
            "Alan McGoff, policy lead for nuclear new build at the Environment Agency, told delegates it could not be predicted then that GDA \"would be quite the success or attract quite the overseas interest which it has\".",
            "McGoff noted that GDA is a voluntary process - \"policy rather than law\" - but is a \"government expectation\" that is \"certainly recognised as a significant contribution\" to a project.",
            "\"Good regulation is key to good investment decisions - it's able to identify the key issues associated with any design and to resolve them before you start construction; because once you start building that's when the big money is going in,\" he said. \"It can have an early influence and it's much easier to change a design before you've poured concrete.\"",
            "The ultimate positive outcome of the GDA process is issuance of a Design Acceptance Confirmation (DAC) from the ONR and a Statements of Design Acceptability (SoDA) from the Environment Agency. Before this, an interim DAC and an interim SoDA are issued.",
            "\"One of Hitachi's key objectives is to avoid that step,\" McDoff said. They want to move straight to DAC and SoDA, not as happened with the UK EPR or the AP1000.\"",
            "The UK EPR design received a DAC and SoDA in December 2012. The UK ABWR began the GDA process in January 2014 and \"remains on target for completion\", McDoff said, at the end of 2017. The AP1000 reached the iDAC and iSoDA stage in Dec 2011, but then Westinghouse paused the process until its owner Toshiba bought a stake in NuGen. It restarted the process in January 2015. The indicative completion date for the AP1000 has been revised to March 2017, McGoff said.",
            "The ONR and Environment Agency are \"principles-based regulators\", he said, and do not follow a \"rule ticking approach\". \"Regulation by principles is very powerful regulation,\" he said. \"It requires the vendor to understand what it is they're trying to achieve and to prove to themselves that that can be achieved before they demonstrate it to us. It makes it a much more intelligent level of regulation.\"",
            "And before a nuclear site licence is granted, the ONR \"needs to be satisfied that the applicant's choice of site is suitable, that it understands the hazards and risks of its activities that it proposes to carry out, and there is a suitable schedule of safety submissions moving through to the pre-construction safety case,\" he said. Before environmental permits would be issued, \"we must be satisfied that the site specific proposals are acceptable and meet best available techniques required,\" he said.",
            "Investment decisions can and do affect the regulators in terms of allocation of resources, he said. \"It's worth reflecting that the FID decision [by EDF] isn't just about Hinkley Point C. It's about four significant packages of work associated with the construction of that plant, the development of Sizewell C and Bradwell B, and the GDA for the Hualong One - the Chinese designed reactor,\" he said. The regulators are also working with the Department of Energy and Climate Change on a future small modular reactor program.",
            "\"Both the ONR and the Environment Agency are fully resourced for the work we're doing now,\" he said. \"Within the Environment Agency, we've always treated new build as an extremely high priority. However, going forward, it is going to become more difficult. We are making moves to grow our own talent and also looking at ways to train regulators with experience of other industries to give them nuclear skills.\"",
            "Completing the UK regulatory process lends international appeal to a project, McGoff told",
            ", by \"adding value to your design and giving greater levels of confidence\". He added: \"The UK regulatory system is recognised as one of the best in the world and I think it does give the opportunity to take that [expertise] outside. And I think that's part of the reason why we've seen such interest in GDA.\"",
            "Asked if a Requesting Party with a reactor design that is already in operation has an advantage in the GDA process, McGoff said: \"I believe they do, the reason being that they will know much more of the evidence to support their design and that makes producing submissions that demonstrate the design can achieve the safety, security and environmental claims that are required so much easier because the evidence should be there.\" He added: \"But even then, the UK will ask more questions to illustrate if somebody said, 'We have a rule in our [national] regulatory regime which means that we have achieved this tick in the box', we will say, 'That’s really interesting, but is that rule correct?' We're not saying it's wrong; it's not for us to challenge other regulators, but is that rule right? You need to convince yourself that the rule is OK. And that helps to produce a much more intelligent dialogue than simple compliance with a rule.\"",
            "National Grid is also waiting for EDF to reach a FID, said its head of major infrastructure development, Sue Adam. EDF Energy was granted a Development Consent Order for a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point early this year.",
            "\"People want to know when construction will start [at HPC],\" Adam told delegates.\"We're currently at low-level engagement. Until we get the news of EDF's FID we're staying quite quiet. Once we've got EDF's FID, we know what our program is and we'll align it and then we’ll be able to go out and start re-engaging with the community in order to explain what our construction activities are going to look like.",
            "\"Construction of this connection isn't going to happen all at the same time. We'll interact with Western Power Distribution. We have a sequential nature to the works, so therefore we'll be able to make our activities in the shorter term, while other activities will not happen for a number of years.\"",
            "The Hinkley Connection project will involve a National Grid 400kV network, consisting of: a 56km connection (49km overhead and 8km underground); two substations and a sealing end compound; upgrading and re-configuring Western Power Distribution's 132kV network; removing 67km of overhead line; laying 10km underground; and making modifications to the existing network. The project will introduce the new T-pylon design to the grid, she said, adding that HPC will require 116 T-pylons.",
            "For the other two new build plans, she said proposals are being developed for formal consultation for the North Wales Connection project, connecting Wylfa Newydd - including a 40km connection beneath Menai Strait, and the North West Coast Connections project, connecting Moorside - including a 142km connection with a 22km tunnel under Morecambe Bay.",
            "All three of the new nuclear build project owners aim to develop a supply chain that enables 60% of the construction value to be delivered by UK companies. EDF Energy has selected preferred bidders for work on HPC, which include, for example, Balfour Beatty Bailey, Laing O'Rourke, Premier Interlink WACO UK Ltd, ABB UK, Schneider Electric and Clyde Union.",
            "Hitachi Nuclear Energy Europe, which began operations as Hitachi's UK arm on 1 April, is \"managing the knowledge transfer of Hitachi's experience from 23 BWR projects and combining this with UK expertise\", said Shunsuke Utena, managing director of the subsidiary. Since 2012, Hitachi-GE has supported Horizon under a front end engineering design, or FEED, contract. Utena told the conference Horizon will soon enter into a Tier-1 joint venture, \"forming a world class delivery team\", with the first strategic Tier-2s likely to be selected soon afterwards. It expects to hold a supplier event this autumn.",
            "Terry Morgan, chairman of the new high-frequency, high-capacity railway for London and the South East, Crossrail, said: \"I can't tell you just how important community engagement is. Ignore that detail at your peril.\"",
            "The £14.8 billion project consists of a new railway 118 km in length and 40 (ten new) stations to deliver 24 trains per hour, making 200 million journeys per year. It will be \"leaving a skills legacy\", Morgan said. As of April this year, the project included 16,543 apprentices, 14,000 people employed on the project and 4398 jobs for local people. Some 63% of spending on the project will go to small- and medium-sized businesses outside London, he added.",
            "EDF Energy has invested more than £11 million in the local area around Hinkley, including training and education.",
            "David Eccles, head of communications for the HPC project, told delegates the consultation process - which started in October 2008 - had \"gone on for longer than any of us would have wanted, but one of the advantages of this long engagement is that those people with whom we were talking during the consultation phase are now the people we are working with to deliver the project in a local sense\". He added: \"Local stakeholders, whether they are business organisations, businesses themselves, local authorities, we've been working with them over the duration of this consultation, getting their thoughts and feedback, adjusting our plans, and, in the light of that feedback, continuing to work with them.\"",
            "The company also \"talks to its neighbours\" immediately adjacent to the site, Eccles said, \"about the issues that concern them - traffic, noise, dust, light - and we talk to the broader community about the implications of the project on their lives and the way that they are going to be necessarily disrupted.\" He added: \"But equally there are lots of opportunities for them and we discuss those in what we call community forums, to which bodies like Stop Hinkley and others are also invited.\"",
            "\"The face-to-face stuff is really important\", he said. \"You can do a huge amount by social media and through our website, but it's actually getting out there, living in the community, having our team based in the community, and engaging with them on a day-to-day basis, not just in a HPC context, but in the broader context of being members of that community from a social, leisure and every other point of view. By doing that, and embedding ourselves, and using these mechanisms, we keep the communication going.\"",
            "Proof of this, he said, is a national survey that asked, 'To what extent do you think that nuclear should be part of the energy mix in the future and nationally?'. \"The answer to that question is about 55%. Immediately around Hinkley and up to about 12-15 miles away, the response is 65%. That demonstrates that local people understand the opportunities presented in terms of skills and employment and business because of this engagement.\"",
            "One of the biggest potential benefits of the HPC project, he said, lies with the supply chain. \"We're working very closely with our Tier 1s to involve UK business and in particular those in the South West. At the end of last year we announced £225 million of contracts at the preferred bidder stage for local companies. In addition, we have a direct contractual relationship with a number of Tier 3 providers.\"",
            "Local companies supporting the HPC site itself include, for example, Somerset Larder, which provides catering services using locally produced food and drink. This is a local joint venture that the project was \"the catalyst to create\", Eccles said. Similarly, the project requires 600,000 steel embedment plates to fix all the reinforcement steel bars. \"We've gone to the steel fabricators in and around Somerset, they've got together to form a joint venture and they are bidding for a portion of that steel fabrication contract.\" He added: \"When people see this is touching their lives and bringing benefits to them, then they are naturally predisposed towards the project.\"",
            "HPC will require, he said, \"160 Tier 1 contractors, all the subsidiary activity beneath that and then all the logistics supply chain beneath that\". EDF Energy is working with Somerset Chamber of Commerce and other business organisations to support companies \"to enable them to get to the standard, whether by entering the South West area's Fit for Nuclear program, or other schemes, so that they can compete effectively for contracts\". The company is also working with central government \"to be able to provide the funds whereby business support is in place in order to maximise the opportunity\".",
            "The level of unemployment in Somerset is less than 2%, he said. \"So the challenge now is how do we engage local skills providers, local businesses who are inevitably going to lose staff to the Hinkley project as they get sucked into its vortex?\" One of the company's solutions for this is its Inspire program through which it engages with education establishments. The program has had more than 100,000 \"student engagements\" in the last four years - to stimulate interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM subjects).",
            "\"Four years ago Bridgewater College had 75 engineering apprentices. This academic year they have 520. That's not entirely down to us, but a large part of it is stimulated by giving young people this focus on the STEM subjects,\" Eccles said. \"The idea of a Silicon Valley may be fanciful, but nonetheless our legacy should be a real culture and a capacity within the local area whereby young people can move into these skills which will in turn attract businesses to come or to remain in the South West because they know the workforce is available for them. That's our real legacy and our real ambition.\""
