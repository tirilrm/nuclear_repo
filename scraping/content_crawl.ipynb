      "Porvair Filtration Group has announced its role in the High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR) currently being developed at Tsinghua University in China. The British company said the technology has the potential to create affordable and reliable energy in some of the world's poorest and most remote countries.\n",
      "The High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor being developed at Tsinghua University in China (Image: Porvair)\n",
      "The reactors will be used to provide economic, environmentally-friendly power to communities which are not connected to national or international grids, but they could also be used to facilitate \"power-hungry\" industrial processes, such as salt water desalinisation in these isolated areas, Porvair said.\n",
      "The university's Institute for Nuclear and New Energy Technology has conducted research on HTGR fuel element technology over the past 30 years. Porvair is developing self-cleaning filtration systems to manage the dust issues associated with the carbon-encased balls which are used to power the reactor.\n",
      "\"These miniature nuclear power plants can generate up to 500 MWe but are small enough that they can be sited where power is needed, even in remote areas where it has never before been practical or economical to build nuclear plants,\" Porvair said.\n"

      "Conservatives pledge to slash infrastructure delivery times and prioritise energy security\n",
      "14 Jun, 2024\n",
      "Rob Hakimian\n",
      "The Conservative Party says it will speed up the average time it takes to consent major infrastructure projects from four years to one if it is in power following the General Election.\n",
      "Conservative Party Manifesto 2024\n",
      "also promises an order of two fleets of small modular reactors (SMRs) with in the party’s first 100 days in office among other actions to “prioritise our energy security”.\n",
      "Speeding up infrastructure delivery\n",
      "Among its actions to speed up infrastructure delivery, the Tory party pledges to “introduce reforms to outdated EU red tape to better protect nature while enabling the building of new homes, new prisons and new energy schemes”. This will reform the “EU’s bureaucratic environmental impact assessment regime” to speed up local and national infrastructure planning systems.\n",
      "The party will ensure that “requirements to offset the impact of new infrastructure and homes on an area are proportionate, without compromising environmental outcomes”.\n",
      "Quicker changes to consented projects will be allowed, reducing the cost of infrastructure, according to the party.\n",
      "National Policy Statements will be regularly updated under a new Conservative government.\n",
      "The reformed planning system will ensure that statutory consultees on major infrastructure will focus on “improving projects in line with clearer objectives, rather than piecemeal requirements that add delays”.\n",
      "The Tories will also “end frivolous legal challenges that frustrate infrastructure delivery by amending the law so judicial reviews that don’t have merit do not waste court time”.\n",
      "Delivering energy security\n",
      "The Tory party pledges to shore up UK energy security by legislating for annual licencing rounds for oil and gas production from the North Sea.\n",
      "The windfall tax on firms, introduced in 2022, will remain in place until 2028-29, “unless prices fall back to normal sooner”.\n",
      "A Tory government would also deliver new gas power stations “to maintain a safe and reliable energy source for days when the weather doesn’t power up renewables”.\n",
      "On renewables, it has pledged to treble the UK’s offshore wind capacity and build the first two carbon capture and storage clusters in north Wales and on Teesside. It would additionally provide a bonus, on top of contract payments that support offshore wind, to reward energy firms that invest in manufacturing in the most disadvantaged places in the UK or invest in more sustainable supply chains.\n",
      "It would invest £1.1bn into the Green Industries Growth Accelerator to support “British manufacturing capabilities, boost supply chains and ensure our energy transition is made in Britain”.\n",
      "Building on the establishment of Great British Nuclear, a newly elected Conservative government would approve two fleets of SMRs within its first 100 days. It says this will “rapidly expand nuclear power, create well-paid, high-skilled jobs and deliver cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy”.\n",
      "Additionally, the Tories would halve the time needed to approve new nuclear reactors. It wil do this by allowing regulators to assess projects while designs are being finalised, improving join-up with overseas regulators assessing the same technology and speeding up planning and environmental approvals.\n",
      "It has reiterated its commitment to building the next large-scale nuclear plant at Wylfa in north Wales alongside completing the delivery of Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C.\n",
      "Overall, these actions will “help the UK to become a net exporter of electricity” thus bringing in additional revenue according to the Tory manifesto.\n",
      "A new carbon pricing mechanism would be put in place by 2027 to ensure that imports of iron, steel, aluminium, ceramics and cement from countries with a lower or no carbon price will face a comparable carbon price to those goods produced in the UK.\n",
      "‘Pragmatic’ approach to net zero\n",
      "A new Conservative government would take a “pragmatic, proportionate and realistic” approach to net zero.\n",
      "This will include a vote in the next Parliament “on the next stage of our pathway, with adoption of any new target accompanied by proper consideration of the plans and policies required to meet the target, to maintain democratic consent for the big decisions that net zero will mean for our country”.\n",
      "Green levies on household bills will be lower under the Tories. The party has promised that energy bills will be lower in each year of the next Parliament than they were in 2023. There would be no further green levies, it has confirmed.\n",
      "It would also reform the Climate Change Committee, “giving it an explicit mandate to consider cost to households and UK energy security in its future climate advice”.\n",
      "The infrastructure investment pledges made in the Conservative Manifesto are a reiteration of promises made in the\n",
      "document released in October 2023 after the cancellation of High Speed 2 (HS2).\n",
      "It promises to spend £36bn of “HS2 savings” on filling potholes, delivering Northern Powerhouse Railway, a new station in Bradford, build the Midlands Rail Hub, deliver upgrades to South West railways, upgrade Ely Junction, electrify the North Wales main line, and reopen abandoned railways among other schemes.\n",
      "It has reiterated support for major road schemes Lower Thames Crossing and the A303 Stonehenge Tunnel.\n",
      "It has further promised that automated vehicles will be on the roads in the next Parliament, “thanks to our world-leading legislation”.\n",
      "It has also pledged support for the growth and decarbonisation of the UK’s aviation sector, with little detail other than the use of sustainable aviation fuels and investment in “future aviation technology”. “We will support domestic flights including through Public Service Obligations, protecting vital routes within the UK, including to islands and remote areas,” it states.\n",
      "Support will also be shown to the maritime sector and its decarbonisation and it promises to “foster our science and innovation expertise in the space industry”. There is little to no further detail on these promises.\n",
      "The Nuclear Industry Association chief executive Tom Greatrex said the nuclear industry “will welcome the continuing commitment to both large and small nuclear projects as an integral part of a balanced, secure and reliable power mix for the future”.\n",
      "He continued: “Cutting the time taken by government to approve new projects is essential to have the pace in delivery which is required for an energy secure future. Sizewell, Wylfa and other sites will play a crucial role, and see the jobs, growth and economic activity that come with new nuclear in all parts of the country.”\n",
      "Conversely, capaign group Stop Sizewell C reacted negatively, saying that the manifesto “overlooks the inconvenient fact that Sizewell C still hasn’t achieved a Final Investment Decision, while refusing to state both how much taxpayers’ money would be required to get it built, and how much households would have to pay during its lengthy and risky construction”.\n",
      "The group continued: “Ironically, given the Conservatives’ desire to halve reactor approval time, this Party seems prepared to commit billions to EDF's disastrous EPR technology, despite it being proven to be so expensive and unreliable.”\n"

      "A safe and reliable emergency power supply is required to operate any nuclear facility. The primary function of the emergency diesel generators (EDGs) is to supply the emergency power required during a loss of offsite power (LOOP) and to guarantee the required voltage and frequency during the emergency power mode.\n",
      "Accordingly, nuclear power plants must have a reliable emergency power system on standby. This reliability can only be achieved if the physical condition of the diesel generators is checked and monitored frequently. Such monitoring helps to anticipate maintenance needs and avoid time-intensive repair work. Permanent monitoring systems help to collect equipment data that can be analysed to make informed decisions about further action. In several cases, a single measurement does not give a clear indication of an issue. Consistent monitoring is needed to analyse trends and characterise the complete behaviour.\n",
      "What is an EDG monitoring system?\n",
      "In general, there are two categories of monitoring systems for emergency diesel generators:\n",
      "Those required under nuclear safety standards (KTA 3702 (2014-11); Emergency Power Generating Facilities with Diesel-Generator Units in Nuclear Power Plants) for operation of the generators.\n",
      "Those that are not mandatory for operation but improve the complete handling of the component itself.\n",
      "According to nuclear standards, a safety-relevant qualified generator set (genset) is required on site. It must have had several running hours in the supplier’s facility and during commissioning. It must have regular test runs (typically monthly) that follow the same principles and test procedures that, with the corresponding monitoring, enable a strong basis for a comparison and respective analysis of the behaviour of the genset or of the single auxiliary components in the nuclear power plant.\n",
      "The monitoring can be based on measurement parameters such as temperature, vibration, pressure, level, speed, start behaviour or electrical values (active power, voltage, current, cos phi, etc).\n",
      "To evaluate the correct conclusions of each parameter, continuous monitoring of the measured values is required (known as condition monitoring).\n",
      "Additional functionalities increase the quality and efficiency of the monitoring tasks. These functionalities include further parameter processing (such as experts’ logic, fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis, maximum/minimum comparisons, calculations, surveillance of limit thresholds, etc.), visualisation, and automatic data mining and reporting.\n",
      "The measured values of the parameters listed above can be recorded in a customised manner and enable pure data recording and visualisation, which provides a basis for further analysis and actions. This information also offers insight into the instrumentation and control (I&C) of the unit and the plant. It is also possible to compare measured values from various test runs of the same and multiple types of diesel generators to detect degradation.\n",
      "A monitoring system that is independent of the original equipment manufacturer also offers the advantages of a uniform system platform, which can be used for a variety of emergency power systems. Several types of generator sets may be used in one facility.\n",
      "Why is it beneficial to have a monitoring system for emergency diesels?\n",
      "Although the monitoring system is not mandatory for operation of the emergency diesel generators, it offers several advantages. In some circumstances a monitoring system will be recommended or even required for finding a solution, or example if damage has occurred that could have been avoided by observing specific trends or identifying defects in which the root cause is not known.\n",
      "A monitoring system can be implemented at any time. The advantages include:\n",
      "Understanding equipment condition\n",
      ". Monitoring data provides useful information about the behaviour of equipment. For example, if there is concern regarding the behaviour of bearings, it can be checked easily by comparing the temperature measurements from the last tests with the different divisions. Performance and condition trends can be checked and appropriate measures, such as more detailed examinations or maintenance work, can be scheduled. This knowledge also supports discussions between the nuclear authority, plant owner, supplier and equipment manufacturer.\n",
      "Facilitating operational processes for monthly tests\n",
      ". A permanent monitoring system reduces setup times for logging monthly tests. Data are recorded continuously and independent of events, so different data sets can be accessed in a time-definable manner to evaluate events. Uniform and generically formulated protocols ease preparation, execution, and completion of the test runs on-site. The maintenance team can focus on the goal of conducting the operational tests.\n",
      ". A detailed alarm and event list with dates and timestamps enables faster, easier and more precise troubleshooting. This can reduce the downtime of the gensets. The monitoring system can help the plant owner identify the root cause of problems with the equipment. For example, with fatigue issues, it is mandatory to find the correct source of the problem to define the proper corrective measures.\n",
      ". Usually diesel generators are maintained in a very conservative way, given their high safety relevance. A component may still fail earlier and lead to complete unavailability of the unit. A monitoring system can give an early indication of issues arising, which helps to schedule the required action in due time, including preparation works. Varying values or a permanent increase in the monthly test runs would give the operator a clear indication they should perform an immediate check or analysis of the component. During normal plant operation, the time for maintenance is strictly limited. Maintenance works must be completed in a certain time, or the plant has to shut down. It is important to have a clear and reliable maintenance programme for continued efficient and reliable operation. Optimisation potential for critical components can be defined in advance and short-term spare parts availability can also be planned.\n",
      ". The most significant advantage of a monitoring system is its ability to help prevent wear during operation. For an emergency power system, this is even more important. High vibrations that are not detected can lead to critical fatigue failures of key components. Performance and condition trends can be identified and localised easily and at an earlier stage.\n",
      "Implementation and extension\n",
      ". Adding an additional monitoring system is always feasible, during each project phase and stage of the plant’s life.\n",
      "In contrast to safety-relevant measurements and detections like overspeed, which are always part of the basic configuration, the monitoring system is non-safety relevant. This means that documentation and qualification efforts are comparably small. Nevertheless, the mounting stability of the parts is analysed to avoid subsequent damage on safety-relevant parts. The monitoring can be handled as an “add-on” to the already available and functional system. Therefore, the existing qualification is not affected. Once a monitoring system is implemented, and if the required space inside the cabinet is still available or can be provided, it can be extended with additional sensors that use the same monitoring for their graphs and trends.\n",
      "When and why start monitoring emergency diesel generators?\n",
      "A monitoring system has several advantages for every emergency diesel generator. Technical and financial effects include minimising the risks, improving maintenance scheduling, and preventing wear during operations.\n",
      "The system can be customised to fit each plant or facility’s needs. It generates graphical data, trends, and developments over several runs of the gensets to help operators analyse data and make informed decisions. Although ‘the earlier the better’, a monitoring system can be implemented at any time of the project and plant lifetime.\n",
      "The monitoring can provide immediate support to evaluate the condition of components with many running hours. As a result, a monitoring system helps to ensure a reliable, safe and economic lifetime of emergency diesel generators.\n",

After screening recently retired and active coal plant sites, the study team identified 157 retired coal plant sites and 237 operating coal plant sites as potential candidates for a coal-to-nuclear transition. Of these sites, the team found that 80% are good candidates to host advanced reactors smaller than gigawatt scale.  \n",

It said the new plant could be in operation by 2028.\n",

      "NuScale conducted a study in the US which estimated that, on average, approximately $100m of existing coal plant infrastructure such the plant’s cooling water delivery systems, site fire protection and existing transmission system connection could be reused for a NuScale plant. The company has also signed a number of agreements for potential SMR deployment in Europe, including coal sites in Poland.\n",
